Put your spatial visualization ability to the test with this quick paced action puzzle game which will continually keep you coming back for more. Work the each level as the speed increases for each. See how many complete lines you can make and challenge yourself by practicing until you reach level 9. In this current early access release version of the game we have available the first 9 levels each progressively more challenging that the last. The engine for the game was built with quality in mind and you will notice as soon as you play the game. This game will continue to keep you coming back for more. Challenge yourself by trying to beat your own high score, or take turns playing with a friend to compete. We plan to add more levels as the project is polished and completed. I hope you will enjoy Ablockalypse in is early release state as we have worked hard to bring you the best play-ability for a game of this particular genre.",
