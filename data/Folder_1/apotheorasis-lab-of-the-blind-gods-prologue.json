    "About the game": "A first person shooter and a blind protagonist walk into a lab. A lab where newborn gods struggle, hope and despair. To survive, you may have to rely on the ones responsible for this mess. Learn what you are and dream of who you could be. Apotheorasis is a first person 3D action thriller without any graphics or UI. Navigation, stealth, shooting, interactions ; you play it all by ear (literally). A recent accident has left you blind, unable to speak, and with no memory of your former self. “We are here to help” whispers a voice softly, yet something feels off. In a twisted stroke of luck, your fate is tied to that of a dubious stranger. All you know is that something far more ominous is lurking around every corner you can't see. Key Features Dream-Like Graphics Close your eyes, listen carefully, and let your imagination handle the rest. 3D Audio (Binaural) That bullet that's coming your way from the top right? Yes, you can tell. Rediscover the Basics Navigate from A to B, dodge traps, and fight enemies ; it will feel like your first time.
