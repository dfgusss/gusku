As you complete the main objectives, you'll run across several side-quests where you can earn Shell-coins that can be spent on upgrading your main characters. Along the way to victory you'll figure out the biggest mysteries of all time, like the purpose of Stonehenge and the mystery of the Yeti, and much more...
