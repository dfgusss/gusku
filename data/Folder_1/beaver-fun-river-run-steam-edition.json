    "About the game": "Beaver Fun™ River Run is an arcade-style, single-player, pixel art inspired, canoe racing game. What's cute isn't always easy! Compete in two qualifying and one medal round on an expansive, physics-engine driven, virtual river full of rocks, logs, strainers, and waterfalls. Advance through groups of rapid sensors, collecting enough red leaves to qualify, and cross the finish line before the time expires. Unforgiving! Water - Differing speeds and directions will move your boat around. Rapid Sensors - Keep alert and plan ahead, hit them in good order or be capsized. Bonus Waves - Time them right and take a plunge... could be a little help or a lot of crunch. Fowl - Do not touch the ducks or risk being given a penalty card. Eggs - Use your hat to block splashes and splats. Beaver Fun™ Friends! On your journey down river, look for friends and items to assist you. Be rewarded by using your boat to catch fish from the river, denying the raccoons the opportunity to eat them. Pick-up cameras to get photos of your journey. Know Your Boat! Read The River! Paddle Hard! Beaver Fun™ River Run was created and developed by one person who still dreams of the days of the arcades.",
