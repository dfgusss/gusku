The many Nations of sentient beings had been at war for almost as long as anyone could remember. The countless conflicts and clashes of weapons and spells of mass destruction threatened to tear the very planet apart. Therefore, the planetary council of magic intervened. The representatives from every nation joined forces to cast a powerful and terrible spell on the entire world.
