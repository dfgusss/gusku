    "About the game": "In this Kakuro-inspired puzzler, you're on a number budget. Try your hand at mastering these simple digits in this colorful, upbeat puzzler. Your goal is simple: combine numbers in their respective rows or columns until all the conditions are met. Will you be able to handle all the tricks waiting in store? What to Expect: Solve 100 math puzzles, but you can only use the numbers 1-9 once apiece; it can be trickier than it looks! Jump from puzzle to puzzle with ease: your work on unsolved puzzles is saved so you can come back to it later. Discover interesting gameplay wrinkles as you move between each tantalizing puzzle set. Choose between six vibrant themes, or use the blank 'minimalist' theme if you want maximum concentration. Enjoy a musical score that evolves as you play the game, or keep it at 'ambient only' to keep things more relaxed.",
