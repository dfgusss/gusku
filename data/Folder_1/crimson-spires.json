All they know is that ever since the so-called 'Contingency,' planes no longer fly overhead, strange creatures have been glimpsed beyond the perimeter, and large mechanical towers will gun down anyone who tries to escape. As you--Sheriff Erika Wright--search for the truth, you must listen to the advice of a serial killer, mingle with extreme conspiracy theorists, and negotiate with vampires.
