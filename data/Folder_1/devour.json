    "About the game": "DEVOUR is a co-op horror survival game for 1-4 players. Stop possessed cultists before they drag you to hell. Run. Scream. Hide. Just don't get caught. HAVE YOU GOT NERVES OF STEEL? 1-4 player online co-op Take control of up to 4 cult members in this unique online co-op experience where you must work together to stop possessed cultists dead set on taking you to hell with them. Single player mode For hardcore players only. In this mode, you'll be doing all the screaming yourself. Challenging gameplay No two DEVOUR playthroughs are ever the same. To stop the evil, you’ll need a focused team and perfect execution, with a single session lasting up to an hour. CAN YOU BANISH EVIL TOGETHER? Each themed DEVOUR map not only brings a terrifying new manifestation of the goat demon Azazel, but also completely new environments to explore, items to collect, fiends to overcome, and forbidden rituals to perform. Exorcise the demonically possessed Your goal is to break Azazel's hold on the cultists. On each map, work together in a race against time to find key ritual items – some of which might be alive and unwilling - to complete the banishment. Escalating difficulty Each possessed cultist’s rage and speed increases as the game progresses, as does the number of fiends they spawn to stop you. Your only means of defence is your UV flashlight. Replayability Locked doors, ritual objects and item spawns are randomized, ensuring that no two games are the same. What's more, DEVOUR's unpredictable AI ups the game, making you second guess each and every move. Player progression Players earn experience with each playthrough, increasing their Cult Rank and earning Ritual Tokens. These are used to unlock valuable Perks, which can mean the difference between living to banish another demon or an agonizing death. Nightmare mode Beat the game without breaking a sweat? Try Nightmare mode for the ultimate challenge. Multiplayer features Make use of our in-game positional voice chat. Bring friends, or find other players using the server browser. Full VR support Ready to turn it up a notch? Play DEVOUR in VR without any additional purchase necessary. The Watchers DEVOUR is the prequel to the 2-player online co-op game The Watchers .
