    "About the game": "Shadow looms over the land causing the Faye to rampage! The Priestess calls upon her knights to resolve the problem. Peter, a skilled traveler with nothing better to do, joins the knights led by Kaine to stop the Shadow. Key Features: Shadow falls upon the land and it's up to Peter and company to stop it! More than 15 chapters, and many optional battles. Help Peter befriend allies and even Faye. Maybe he'll even find love! Balance relationships and equipment to form the most effective team. A classic visual style. Poem of Legends: Once there lived side by side, four little Faye Used to be just alike, fairies that played True wing-ed creators, mouldings of shade Little bits of the earth on each birthday When it was over legends they'd tell Whispering arm in arm, for a long spell One day a quarrel came, hot tears were shed 'You can't play in my yard,' but their mother said I don't want to play in your yard I don't like you any more You'll be sorry when you see me Sealing down your will and more You can't holler out your grand spells You can't find your own way free I don't want to play in your yard If you won't be serving me Long away four little Faye each other miss Quarrels are soon made up, sealed Shadow bliss Then hand in hand again, happy they go Sisters all through life to be, they love each other so Soon dark days pass away, sorrows and bliss But demons 'member yet, quarrels and miss In sweet dreams of childhood, we hear the cry 'You can't play in my yard,' and the old reply I don't want to play in your yard I don't like you any more You'll be sorry when you see me Sealing down your will and more You can't holler out your grand spells You can't find your own way free I don't want to play in your yard If you won't be serving me",
