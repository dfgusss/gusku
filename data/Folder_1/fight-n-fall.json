    "About the game": "Slap, push, zap, and freeze solid your friends in lightning-fast combat with up to 4 players. Perfect for parties and also perfect to teach your siblings a lesson or two on who is boss. Fight N’ Fall is filled up with unique, colorful destructive arenas ready to be destroyed by your might! Hammer down the right arena pieces to send your enemies - or yourself - frying into the void! Fight N’ Fall will have a bunch of unique game modes that allow you to get your creative juices flowing and play the game the way you want to! For now, the only ones available are the classic and frenzy mode. Ability Draft lets you assemble your own hero from a set of randomly chosen abilities. We have game modes like frenzy mode, where every time you use a spell you get a new random one. Deathmatch mode has no rounds and no arena destruction, it’s all about who can rack up more takedowns in 10 minutes! If you are feeling lucky, you can always go to random mode, where the wackiness is off limits! It matters not if you are a seasoned veteran of the gaming world or if you never touched a gamepad before: It just takes 4 buttons and 1 analog stick to have endless fun with your friends! Each arena breaks differently! Some arenas have special mechanics, like turning you into a dragon or sending in mysterious gifts. 10 Power Ups to spice up the combat even more! Everyone has a dash. Fight N’ Fall is best enjoyed with friends, so call your buds and invite them over for the fight and falling of a lifetime! We support a large array of controllers including Xbox, PlayStation, Switch and many more! Even if your controller is not natively supported, we support Steam Input, so we’ll always get you covered! We also support Remote Play Together! But please keep in mind the video quality and input lag will vary depending on your internet connection and hardware speed.",
