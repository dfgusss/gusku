    "About the game": "Discover A New Kind Of Fighting Game! Fighting Fiends is a top-down fighting game which can be played with 2 to 4 players, both locally and online! It features a unique combo system that requires you to read your opponent to get big combos. Rollback Netcode Fighting Fiends has rollback netcode! Rollback is the best kind of netcode for fighting games, basically it means online matches will be smooth even at relatively high ping. Characters Leon A national hero who protects the land from evil... Leon has fast movement and attack speed but short range. When up close he will beat you up with powerful mix-ups and combos. Rat His motives are unclear, is it even the same rat every time? Rumor has it he's a big shot in the underground Rat Mafia, if such a thing even exists...

To make up for it he can stand on his hind legs and move around more freely at the cost of being hard to control. Nicolas Not too long ago Leons little brother Nic fused with a demon named Olas, together they have been terrorizing the land ever since... Nicolas is a powerful but somewhat slow setup character. He is most powerful when his opponent is in his fireballs range which he can explode remotely. More characters to come...",
