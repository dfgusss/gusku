    "About the game": "In Fractal Fly what you do is simply… fly! There is nothing to win, just the world around you to explore: Fractals are computer generated landscapes, but you don’t have to know how it works, all is already setup for you so that you can just enjoy it. There are countless details in a fractal, you can lose yourself in the landscapes, just admiring and listening to the peaceful music that accompany it. Fractal fly is about relaxing and contemplating. You can also morph all the landscape and discover even more details and shapes. When you download Fractal Fly, you’ll have access to a free fractal. The others are in app purchase, but you will be able to preview them with a pre-determined ride in the fractal, and if you like it, you can buy it, and you’ll be able to fly everywhere you want in it! Fractal Fly runs with or without a VR headset. So even if you don’t have a VR headset, give it a try, it’s free!",
