    "About the game": "I, Hope is a beautiful coming of age adventure story about a young girl named Hope, whose town has been taken over by Cancer. The game is engaging for all, yet for survivors and children who are currently battling cancer, the game is empowering. The developer has truly set out to make a game that kids can play while receiving cancer treatments; something to distract them, but at the same time, put them back in control of their battle. In addition to this being a great game, the developer is donating all their proceeds from the game to Game Changer Charity, a wonderful non-profit organization whose mission is to spread hope and love to children staying in hospitals. When we think of video games, our minds go to epic battles, fantasy worlds, crazy races and mind-boggling adventures. For Kenny Roy, creating a game is about hitting the perfect balance between pure amusement and lifting spirits.",
