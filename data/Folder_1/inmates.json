Unfortunately, according to the voice coming from the old radio, things are not as simple as you’d like them to be. Delve deep into your psyche while trying to stay sane, in this most disturbing of horror games. Features Interact with the environment to unravel the truth Intense and mind-bending puzzles Suffocating setting Disturbing imagery High-quality graphics powered by Unreal Engine 4 Controller support Estimated game length: 3-4 hours",
