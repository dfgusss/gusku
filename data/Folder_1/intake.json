Blast and combo your way through an epic cascade of audiovisual mayhem so intoxicating it comes with its own warning label. FEATURES Classic Arcade Shooter: From its aspect ratio to its fast-paced game play, Intake is directly inspired by classic arcade shooters and SHMUPs with just a hint of FPS love. Achievements: Over 70 finely tuned achievements that will teach even the most hardcore player new tricks. These are not your typical progress-only achievements.
