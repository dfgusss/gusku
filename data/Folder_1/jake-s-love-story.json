Will the group manage to stay friends? Who knows. How Jake’s story will end? Game features: Parody of anime cliches! Around 20 decision points during one game! See how they impact the story! 9 different story endings! Beautifully drawn, partially animated backgrounds! Calm and relaxing music (except for more dynamic events) About 1-1,5 hours to one ending",
