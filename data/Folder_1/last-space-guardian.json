    "About the game": "Humanity has developed technologically to the point where we can travel beyond the unknown deep space! But we never imagined what we'd find there. Alien races more evolved than us! We were invisible to them until that moment, but now they have come in search of taking all that has always been ours! We were forced to create a fleet of ships with our best technologies to defend our solar system from this great invasion! But it was in vain, we were all decimated! Our last hope was in an experimental technology of analysis and cloning skills! Initially installed on a single ship and entrusted to you, so that you defend our home! Defend our solar system from this great alien invasion! You'll command the only ship that has the technology capable of cloning the special abilities of enemy ships, and hone in on every stage you've won! Game style Shoot'EmUmp in pixel art, which aims to remember and honor the great retro games of the past, offering you that old childhood nostalgia! Survive 10 enemy stages! Shoot 'Em Up style, spaceship game, in pixel art and 8-bit retro music! Evolve your shot to the maximum level, use the energy bar for upgrades, and special abilities! Advance each stage by defeating Bosses and enemies to collect new skills, transformations and extra lives! At each level, new enemies will emerge to challenge you, and then you think you're capable of defeating them all?",
