The basic gameplay is extremely simple, and only requires two buttons: the left click of your mouse will drop lines from the sky, while the right click will make those lines dash forward. As the pace of the opposition gets faster and the line start splitting and crossing Line/Dash becomes a hypnotic and ever-changing visual experience. Are you ready to put your reflexes through its paces in the middle of a deluge of arrows, sounds and neon colors? Due to a very cool and custom audio compartment, this Rez-like game will falbbergast you without any doubt! Features: Immediate gameplay, just two buttons to drop lines from the sky and make them dash forward Intriguing music and sfx perfectly fiting with the ever-increasing speed of the gameplay Neon-like colors and vintage, arcade look, with a little modern twist WARNING Lots of contrasting bright colors, if you have problems with that stuff maybe don't play it Controller Support The game is fully playable with a controller after setting it up in the initial launcher. It will still need keybord/mouse support to get through the launcher",
