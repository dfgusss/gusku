    "About the game": "In Lucid Cycle, sleep teleports you into enigmatic or trippy dreams where everything is obvious, yet somehow unexpected. The game offers a set of short but unique experiences. Tiny bit of puzzles, tiny bit of platforming, and some finding objects... As you progress, you paint a painting during the daylight hours, and the ultimate goal of the game is to see it completed. Enjoy your journey, one dream at a time. Save progression: Lucid Cycle saves your progression at the beginning of each dream, and each time you wake up.",
