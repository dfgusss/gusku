    "About the game": "I did not see a marching simulator on the market, so I made one! This is a 2D, sprite based marching simulator. It is intended to give the user what it would feel like to march a military formation, as well as see how well they can do! You will give commands by keyboard or mouse to a flight of 12. These 12 must execute 10 commands from a list of 27 within a 70 ft by 70 ft area. Your score depends on how fast your flight can execute your commands, and how well you stay in your are. Do you have what it takes? This is a constant work in progress so any feedback is appreciated.",
