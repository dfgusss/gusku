    "About the game": "“The porter drew a map for me on the back of a brochure. In smudged pencil he showed me where to turn from the main road onto a dirt road and then where to leave the road entirely. I left the streetlights behind me and traveled into the dark.' Marginalia is a first-person horror game that transports you to Kestlebrook, a secluded valley where history becomes enmeshed with a strange present. Weeks ago Eric left. Days ago you got a letter telling you to come to him. Now you're here, but precisely where is here? And better yet, when? Features: Two plotlines that interweave with one another to tell the full story of Kestlebrook. Vast tracts of New England woodland handcrafted by the developers. A story about loss and what a person will do to fix a broken past. No jump scares. Just a slow, creeping dread. Powerful ambient soundtrack. Xbox controller support Like, some mythology and runes, or, y'know, whatever. Forged in the fires of October 2014, and remade from scratch in 2017",
