Craft Do you have the skill and craftsmanship to make beautiful artisanal items? Neither does Merek but putting a few items on a crafting table and hitting them with a hammer seem to turn up decent results. Haggle Skilfully negotiate your way into heady profits. Unethical side note, richer folk will pay through the nose for any product. Do with that information what you will. Big...Customers Battle absurd bosses and craft custom items for them. If you can't manage that then at least try your best to keep your shop in one piece. 4 Player Local Co-op Can't invite your friends round?
