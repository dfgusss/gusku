    "About the game": "The unwanted are kicked into the black sea... ... where they would melt and harden into a pure metal. The metal was then harvested and put to good use by the common man. From the most handsome developer ever... Samu presents you with a new RPG experience that will Blow. Your. Mind. Introducing Mothlight. A game about exploration, weird stuff, and exploring a world made entirely out of people. Literally. WORLD This world is different. As people were kicked into the black sea, their bodies melted and then hardened into a pure metal called 'Dreg Ore'. Soon the ore started to clump together and form islands. This happened more and more until continents were made. People who were kicked in fell on land instead of in the water. And then boom. Civilization. GAMEPLAY Your main goal is to explore and thrive! Gear up, get cooler armor and be more stylish. Fight more bizarre bosses and find more exciting items! The world is yours to conquer! STORY Neethan threatens Augus in a time most harsh. Demons from the darkest depths of the sea are making everyone go mad. The Apostles of the Deep Ones are manipulating powerful entities... And Enzo is stuck in the middle of it. Escape this hell and return to the world above... ...or be devoured by the eldritch abominations below. A Game by: SAMU~ Music by: Chez Monplaisir Hey, if you like this game and want to support the Developer: ;)",
