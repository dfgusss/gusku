This carnival of frenetic fun is showcased in a cutting edge graphics extravaganza. Viewed from well above, you and your enemies can always be seen. Always be killed, and always be laughed at! There is no hiding. No tactics. No planning. No Net. Your enemies created this world and they sure ain’t gonna help you out! You like to play hard? Then the game gets harder. Feel like you're doing well? ... Enjoy it while it lasts! Survive long enough, and you get rewarded with score multipliers, doubling your score. Making your enemies even angrier, and that bit more determined to kill you! Lose a life and watch your multipliers tumble, and the beasties slow down and relax, safe in the knowledge that you are just a big softy really!! After you conquer all 89 levels you’ll be awarded a ‘White Belt’. Progress to win all 8 belts until you possess the much coveted Mutant Storm ‘Black Belt’. Key Features 89 Levels Adventure &amp; Tally gameplay modes 7 Difficulty levels Over 20 unique enemies Psychedelic 3D visuals and effects Global Online Leaderboards Local multiplayer Achievements",
