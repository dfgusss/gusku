Will you be one of them? Will you even survive your freshman year? (That's not a joke, most of our freshman class is slaughtered early on) Make friends, make enemies, make significant others, make other significant others jealous that you are stealing their significant other! Wake some Old Gods! Who knows what tomfoolery you will run into? Look no further, for you, gentle video game player, have found the greatest elder horror dating simulator in all of the land! Tell me of this game's many features! Romance! Interact with and maybe date a plethora of nightmare creatures! Help them achieve - or even uncover - their wildest dreams! Stand-alone dating sim set in the Army of Tentacles universe! A brand new adventure - an intermission game, if you will - set between Army of Tentacles: (Not) A Cthulhu Dating Sim and Super Army of Tentacles 3: The Search for Army of Tentacles 2 . This time, however, it isn't anything other than a straight dating sim. 10% of sales go towards the Brain Trauma Foundation.",
