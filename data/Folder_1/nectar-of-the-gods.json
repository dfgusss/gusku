    "About the game": "Nectar of the Gods is an unquenchable head-to-head real-time strategy / tower defense game where bugs battle over the finest beverages. You must strategically deploy a chosen bug family, nimbly navigate the countertop, and claim liquid nirvana! Party any way you want : Solo, Local Multiplayer, Online with Friend, Unranked Online, Ranked Online 24 unique bugs with special abilities and quirks for you to optimize across 3 Bug Families (Beetle Brigade, The Hive, Spidey Party) Navigate 3 dynamic countertops: Soda Fountain, Boba Shop, Coffee Bar Colorful, delicious visuals to immerse you in the miniature conflict Catalog your journey with detailed game statistics and achievements Lead your bugs with multiple inputs : M/K or Controller In Nectar of the Gods you will embody Beetle Brigade , The Hive , and Spidey Party . Each bug family has 8 unique bugs with special abilities and quirks. Examples include a Rhino Beetle that propels fellow beetles forward with it's mighty stampede. And a Queen Bee that boosts your team's resources by producing precious royal jelly. All of the bugs have sampled the sweet sweet nectar of the drink industry and are counting on you to coordinate a winning drink against any bugs standing in your way. In order to deliver this bubbly bliss, you will need to maximize every bug's contribution, while squashing anything your opponent or the countertop can throw at you. I was inspired to make Nectar of the Gods by the 'rock paper scissors' tactics and mental reflexes of real-time strategy games. I love the idea of bite sized asymmetrical battles where you have to think quick on your feet and rely on your mastery of the units available to you. And bugs are rad!",
