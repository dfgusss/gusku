    "About the game": "-------------------------------------- [NETABOKU -A robot girl changes my life as a bedridden boy-] -------------------------------------- Thank you for watching NETABOKU! This game was modeled after the avatar robot cafe​, and I made it with the people who actually worked there. A bedridden young man meets an android girl and discovers the meaning of his life in this sci-fi romantic adventure game. The genre of this game is a visual novel. I hope that 20 years from now, technology will have made the impossible possible, and you will be able to live freely even if you are bedridden, and I hope that 20 years from now, we will see further advances in real-world technology and events like this one come to fruition, and I hope that the players will feel a sense of hope for the future as well! *Live play and video submissions on distribution sites are welcome. However, please do so within the bounds of common sense. -------------------------------------- ・Story Japan circa 2040. Thirteen years ago, a great earthquake submerged some areas of Tokyo, but thanks to advanced technology, reconstruction is steadily progressing. The protagonist, Kanto, lives in a residential facility for people with physical disabilities who find it difficult to live at home. One day, he meets a mysterious girl, Kanata, and begins to experience many things. He was born with a physical disability, so going shopping, staying alone, working at a café, and all the things that everyone takes for granted are new to him, and he expects this joy to last forever... ・Method of operation Left click or Enter key to advance.
