    "About the game": "Ossuary is a darkly funny satire about a Discordian underworld where no one can improve themselves. Navigate dialogue-based puzzles and use sins as inventory items to help those who have fallen to corrupt virtue. Explore an intricate, black-and-white space with layered, interconnected challenges. Be unsettled by the cabbages disguised as people. Kick around the spiders who have hatched from skulls. Learn of the Curse of Grayface and the nature of disorder. Can you escape the place of bones? ​Note: MacOS support for this title will end beginning in 2022. For more information, see our blog post and FAQ ​.",
