    "About the game": "Pathfinders are eager to know more about human History. They have studied different civilizations of the past. With the support of the scientist Albert New, they travel through space and time, visiting these ancient people in person. Their objective is to collect relics from each civilization and create a museum of human memories. To achieve this, they will have to go through dangerous paths, facing obstacles, entrapments, and enemies. Your role is to memorize these obstacles and draw a safe path for them. Is your memory sharp enough to do that? Six different civilizations to visit, and three levels of difficulty. Checkpoints and flags can be used as markers to help you memorize the path. But you will earn a bonus if you don't use them. You can earn optional coins in each level by going through more complex paths.",
