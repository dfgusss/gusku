    "About the game": "Popo's Tower is a colorful rapid 3D-Platformer in which a stranded pilot jumps, climbs, and dropkicks their way through a magical island. Climb high towers, run across walls, and make dangerous jumps you deemed impossible! Features 30 to 60 minutes of playtime. A juicy, versatile movement system with various mechanics such as wall-running, double jumping, and dropkicking. Cute procedural animations. A cool island to explore, with an atmospheric soundscape. Optional collectibles to find and obtain. Good for speedrunning (includes an in-game timer). Note: the game doesn't have a saving functionality, as it's designed to be completed within single runs!
