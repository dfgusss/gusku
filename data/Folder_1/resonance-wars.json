    "About the game": "This game is a turn-based strategy game with some fighting elements. You can move your units during planning and it becomes a fighting game when you want to attack your enemies. On the other hand, enemies have the same abilities. When the game starts you can get 5 units: warrior, wizard, archer and the queen. Each unit walks in a different number of squares on the grid. You will take turns playing around with your opponent. When your unit and your opponent are on the same square, the game will turn into an action fighting game. Whoever wins the battle will gain a space in that square.",
