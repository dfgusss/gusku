Explosives can now be created by making large matches, so you can blast your way through levels. There are new types of game pieces, new blockers to destroy, updated bonus goals, improved minigames and quests, new runes and journals to collect, new level progress tracking, new characters, and so much more! Adventure awaits... Runefall 2 is a match-3 game like no other.
