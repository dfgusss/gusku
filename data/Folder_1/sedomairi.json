    "About the game": "“Sedo” is the world between living and dead. If you want to get back alive, catch all the straw figures. Howver, you must not be found by the children of the Angel of Death. SEDOMAIRI is a first-person action horror game where you escape from a randomly generated world that looks like an old Japanese house. You have a radio. The radio enables you to detect the distance and direction of enemies and figures. Use the radio to collect all the straw figures while hiding from the enemy, the children of the Angel of Death, and try to get back alive from the 'Sedo'. Gameplay built for fear The distance of the player's lights, the distance of footsteps, the distance of the enemy's vision, and the distance at which the radio can detect the enemy are all calculated and set to make you fearful. This ensures that you will always have the fear that they might be right there. Randomly generated maps This game generates maps with more randomness than my previous game, 'Infection Maze'. Therefore, you can enjoy fresh play even after repeating the game. In addition, a custom mode is included. You can customize the size of the map, the number of enemies, and other aspects of the gameplay by yourself. Battery management for items The items the player has are a light and a radio. Both are essential for exploring the map, but they have batteries that need to be recharged within a certain period of time. It makes you feel tense. The atmosphere of a Japanese house 30 years ago I created this art model with the atmosphere of a Japanese house 30 years ago in mind, which only a Japanese author can create. About streaming You are allowed to stream this game play on video sites or upload videos of your play. Support for game controllers The PS3 controller is not supported. If you encounter a problem that prevents you from operating the game properly and you have some kind of controller connected to your PC, please start the game with all controllers disconnected and try to play with the keyboard and mouse.",
