    "About the game": "GAMEPLAY SHAPESHOOTER is literally an on-rail shooter, you'll have to clear colonies across 4 planets from a little creatures infestation called polygoneers. But that's not important, you'll not get a story here. You'll get frenetic action, insane music and a super hard challenge! WEAPONS In SHAPESHOOTER you'll have 5 different weapons, all of them have 3 levels. Gatter OCTARINGS to upgrade them, and trust me, you'll need it. TRAPS Besides a the polygoneers, you must watch out for traps, A LOT OF THEM. Look at the size of this saw, I bet it has at least 200px wide. UPGRADES Improve your tank to survive, there are weapons, shield, magnet, wheels and of course skins, because you need to be shining while destroying everything in front of you.",
