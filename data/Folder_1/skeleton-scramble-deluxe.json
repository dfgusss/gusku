    "About the game": "Skeleton Scramble Deluxe is a fast-paced, head-to-head real-time strategy game, with a focus on local multiplayer. You will take on the role of a necromancer, gathering resources to summon an army of skeletons and frantically building a gauntlet of defenses to fend off your opponent, (or a computer-controlled bot.) An innovative upgrade system lets you build units on top of one another to create new creatures and buildings, adding strategic depth without adding complexity to the controls. Controls are simple and easy to learn, allowing new players to jump right into the action! Play one-handed using only the mouse, connect multiple controllers, or play head-to-head with a friend using a shared keyboard! Your army will move and attack autonomously, allowing you to focus on what to build, and when/where to build it. Most games last under 5 minutes, allowing you to experiment with bold new strategies, or rotate between players in group settings. Maps can be generated randomly, allowing for a more chaotic experience. Planned Launch Features: 2 player local versus with 5 control schemes 10 CPU-controlled bots with a variety of strategies and difficulties Interactive Tutorial Score-based Survival Mode Rogue-lite Gauntlet Mode with stacking player-selected curses",
