    "About the game": "Tales of the Neon Sea is a retro-style pixel-art adventure, set in a fully-realized cyberpunk cityscape where you will encounter innumerous items to investigate, curious easter eggs, and a whole cast of interactive NPCs. You must analyze every detail, and discover the truth that lurks behind the heavy mist… Take on the role of Rex, veteran cop turned hard-boiled detective. Investigate crime in a future cyberpunk world, where the magnificent sky city blots out the sun - but the neon lights never go out. Solve a strange murder case involving clues from a robot rebellion… The illusion of the past re-emerges. The weird equipment inside the brain. The mysterious package of evidence. The shadow with a beaked mask. All pointing to a serial murder case from 13 years ago... A semi-mechanical god manipulates the destiny of all in this utopia. Rebels lurk in the dark, in the underground world where chaotic slums and tricks grow. Our detective will scout for clues and end unfulfilled wishes... Features: Gripping Narrative Investigate the murder scene, examine the evidence, and use your powers of deduction to solve the case, piece by piece. Once the mist has cleared, will you see the truth - or uncover an even bigger mystery? Old School Pixel-art and Detailed Environmental Design Stunningly detailed retro-style pixel-art, coupled with modern atmospheric lighting and sumptuous visual effects, bring this unique cyberpunk world to life. Evocative music and sound design build layers of suspense and mystery, every step of the way. Multiple Achievements and Collectable Elements A variety of hilarious, exhilarating achievements are waiting to be uncovered as you explore a rich and detailed background story. Hooked on collectors' fever? You won't want to miss this. Rich and Varied Puzzle Design Puzzles that will challenge your powers of logic, observation skills and patience! These challenges skillfully combine narrative and environmental elements designed to augment your journey in this weird and vibrant world. Play as a Cat? Of Course! Feeling lonely on this odd adventure? Take control of a special 'assistant': William the black cat. William can travel deeper into areas our detective can’t reach - often proving decisive in identifying and retrieving key evidence! An Intriguing Dystopian World If robots had their own god, what would it look like? And if they had the same rights as humans… would they betray us? When there are no boundaries between flesh and machine… what is life? This eccentric cyberpunk world holds all the answers…",
