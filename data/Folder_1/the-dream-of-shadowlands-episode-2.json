    "About the game": "CONTENT WARNINGS: Body horror, violence, scary imagery, blood, strong language The Dream of Shadowlands Episode 2: The Corpse of the Labyrinth After narrowly escaping their previous surroundings, Rina and Jyl find an abandoned temple to Yurenica. The lingering remains of a demon society hide a twisted maze and the history that its inhabitants left behind. Uncovering a wealth of Shadowlands theology and the frightening creatures that have since overtaken the premises, Rina begins to better understand her circumstances. But as the stakes are risen and new challenges are presented, how will the motivations of those around her change? 'The Dream of Shadowlands' is a top-down RPG series inspired by the RPGMaker horror niche. It features art assets that were drawn traditionally with ink and paper, and a retro style based on 90's anime. Some of the art, namely the animated cutscenes, are done using traditional cel ink and paint! This is the second episode in a series planned to run for 5 episodes.
