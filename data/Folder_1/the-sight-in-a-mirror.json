    "About the game": "'The Sight in a mirror' is a game that collects items and escapes from the monster's house. Late at night, lost, you find a house attracted by the light. When you enter the house, the door locks and you are chased by something, not a person. You need to look carefully at the room to find the card key to escape. Use the sight of the monster in the mirror to locate the monster. The monster finds your location more and more accurately. If you think it's dangerous, get out of your seat quickly.",
