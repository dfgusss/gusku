    "About the game": "BETTER GAME. LOWER PRICE. NOW WITH CO-OP. A hack'n'slash adventure with heavy emphasis on exploration and dungeon crawling while using rogue-lite elements such as over-the-top items, permadeath, and random generation. 50+ VARIOUS ITEMS Every item is designed to shift the way you play: from standard buffs to combat enhancements to new ways of traversing puzzles, items are made to work together and grant the player cool item combinations every time they play. A CHANGING WORLD By progressing further and completing dungeons, the story introduces new bosses to defeat, tougher enemies to fight and more complex environments to conquer. PRE-BUILT DUNGEONS Within each randomly generated world is a matching pre-existing dungeon that introduces new mechanics, enemies and story elements into the main game. STUFF TO HIT 20+ bosses to defeat, dozens of enemies to grind out for gold, the works. A RESPONSIVE SOUNDTRACK Our original soundtrack adapts during gameplay to match the pace of battle.",
