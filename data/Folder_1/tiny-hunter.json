    "Release date": "Jul 6, 2021",
    "About the game": "You play as an antivirus installed on a fake operating system. Your objective is to clean up more than 100 files to finally access a part of the game corrupted by a panoply of bugs and viruses. The main character can propel himself, jump, sprint, shoot, pilot a ship, use grapples, swim at any speed and in any direction as long as he masters the key combinations wisely. You can play at your own pace in normal mode or activate the speedrun mode and try to get the best medal. A ranking system is also present to compare your times with those of players around the world. The game is entirely designed to be played with a controller but can be played with a keyboard/mouse if you like 'die and retry'. Strongly inspired by Super Meat Boy, Celeste, or Splasher the game deliberately mixes speed, rhythm and combat. The levels can be completed without ever stopping, so are you ready to take up the challenge ?",
