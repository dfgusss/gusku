    "About the game": "Turtle Lu Turtle Lu is an old-school Action-Adventure game, Explore immense 2D Zones. Day after day, Lu watched creepy little caterpillars crawl past his window. Everywhere. Like the pitter patter of birds on a tin roof, the squirming sensation of moles crawling under the floor. The days flew by, each like the one before, monotonous. Lu lay down with the sunset every night, and awoke to the cock-a-doodle doo of the rooster outside every morning. The months passed by, the spring rain, autumn sun, leaves of fall and nowsnow is falling on the roof. Lu curled up in his shell and fell into a long, deep sleep. Winter was as it always is, and soon the first rays of the sun broke through the dirty, cobwebbed window. 'It looks like it's time to wake up ' he thought, opening his heavy eyes. As he crept outside his house, he was in for a big surprise. The little caterpillars had grown into giant, dangerous Monsters! Huge, angry bees circled around his home, stingers ready towell, sting! Mad urchins darted from house to house, destroying everything in their paths with fearsome needles! 'This outrage must be stopped!' Lu exclaimed as he set out on his perilous journey FEATURES : - Beautiful, realistic graphics. - Various levels. - Pleasant sound effects and music.",
