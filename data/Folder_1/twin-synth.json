    "About the game": "Shoot to move. Shoot to make music. This retro twin-stick shooter brings back the feel of a classic arcade game with thumping synth beats and sound generated by your actions . Master the unique 1-1 control mechanics to unlock the perfect build, all while racking up style points by laying down sweet bass lines. Twin Synth is part game , part groovebox . It's part twin-stick shooter , part synthesizer . Feel the beat in this action-packed &amp; rhythmic twin-stick shooter where two guns are better than one . Use the unique momentum-based movement to synthesize a symphony of sound while you play or delve deep into the custom 'synth section' at any time to craft your own soundtrack . The only game that let's you literally create the soundtrack while you play - no audio samples are used in the game at all ( all sounds are generated at runtime ) and so the player has full control over what they hear. No thrusters, no engines, just Twin blasters. Shooting pushes you in the opposite direction , so shoot carefully! Shoot both guns at once for some high-level techniques. A fully featured 16 channel mixer &amp; synth control section gives you complete control of the sound at any time. Actions made here are carried through into gameplay and vice-versa. This means you can tweak the synths to make new unique sounds or just grab a ready-to-go preset and perform for your friends . Unique control mechanics: shoot two guns at once . More guns, more fun. Unique movement mechanics: move only through your recoil - be careful where you shoot. Unique music-based gameplay - you make the music while you play .
