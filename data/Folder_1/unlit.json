    "About the game": "Once upon a time, not too long ago, there lived an old lady with her husband in a large, but quite humble mansion. One night, which started like many others, the old couple went to sleep after having a cup of green tea. That night, the old lady woke up to find her husband gone. All he left behind were his camera and a lantern. Where could he go to at this time of night? And why? Our elderly friend decides to go look for him, accompanied by her ever-loyal and smarter-than-average cat companion. Join this little old lady in her quest to find her lost husband, and you might unravel the secrets that lie beneath the mansion.",
