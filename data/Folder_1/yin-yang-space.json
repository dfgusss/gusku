    "About the game": "I like Counter-Strike and its level editor Hammer very much. Thanks to the Unity engine I think I've achieved a combination of both: the easiest way to build 3D game levels and play fast. In this game you can build a garden in sandbox building mode, and then put some robots to play with you. After switching to FPS mode, you can compete with robots in the garden and buildings. Game Features: 1. Use the easiest way to build a game level scene. 2. Play FPS games in your own scene.",
