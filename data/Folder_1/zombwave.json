    "About the game": "ZombWave is a 2d, top down zombie arena shooter game with roguelike element. In this game you have only one job, SURVIVE. This is a hardcore game where every mistake is punished. No one level will be the same, because in this game is a implemented a random spawn enemy. That the reason why is a each gameplay a different. You improve your character in the game. But be careful, if a character dies or you leaves the level before completing it, you will lose all the improvements you have You unlock the characters while playing. Every fifth level you get a new character with a different weapon and little different skills. This is my first game and i will try to improve it in the future as well. Thank you for understanding. Well enjoy the game. :)",
