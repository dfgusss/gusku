    "About the game": "You're a circle. You're the good guy. But you're surrounded by squares. Some are irrelevant. Others are useful and/or annoying. Then there are the black squares. They want to kill you. They are the bad guys. Be a good guy and pulverize those baddies, will you? Survive and shoot all enemies in 200 levels (or make them shoot themselves). Each level cleared opens the next one permanently (autosave). Enemies come in a variety of types, speeds and action patterns, while other squares do a multitude of things, ranging from reflecting bullets to teleporting you. Enemies are killed with a single hit, and so do you. Failing a level has no consequences. While the first levels are easy and often, very quick, difficulty increases greatly in later levels.
