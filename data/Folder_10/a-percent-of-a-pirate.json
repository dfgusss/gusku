A pirate adventure By playing a pirate, you will have to repeal the goblins which will try to get back the treasure you stolen. You will have to build defenses to survive, and escape from this isle before you get caught. During this adventure, you will have to learn how to manage your defenses. For that, you will have different ways to learn how to calculate the required number of ammos, or the amount of your discounts to decrease the price of your purchases.
