    "About the game": "TreeView Studio's Alchemist Defender VR is a tower defense strategy game designed from ground up to be enjoyed on high end Virtual Reality devices. The game balances tower defense mechanics with intense first person combat using melee and ranged weapons. Take on the role of a Master Alchemist who after years of researching and crafting tools to find the Philosopher's Stone, have invented a portal to new worlds. The energy of those lands will fuel your final journey to reach the Stone. To your surprise you are confronted by a rebellion in each world you plan to consume. Now in the midst of glory only a final resistance stands between the Alchemist and absolute power. Will you be able to stand your ground and dominate those who resist?
