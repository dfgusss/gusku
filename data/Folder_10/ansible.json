    "Release date": "Nov 8, 2018",
    "About the game": "Ansible is an action focused survival horror game. it tries to focus on action and positional play more than the hide and seek approach established by recent games in the same genre. Hence, it tries to take inspiration from games like Dead Space and Resident Evil 4 without the more clunkier aspects. But without removing those loved aspects, it tries to make them dynamic and modernizes them. Plot : Taking a camping trip with girlfriend Emily, Joe thought this would be just another ordinary camping trip. But what he unearths there will change him and you forever. This 4th wall breaking Sci-Fi story will make you question yourself and the memories that might lurk beneath the shadows of your conscience. Begone Hide and seek : Feel powerless in horror games? Feel that these encounters would be better if your character would just raise his hands to block? Well, Because Ansible takes inspiration from classic horror games, there is a variety of guns that you can use. These guns are not only powerful, they are also hard to use and can open you up to a quick painful death. Tread Carefully while using the automatic shotgun, that thing will blow your ears away! Hours of enjoyment : The game features 5-6 hours of content if the player has no issues with the difficulty. (Testing stated 5 hours when not dying and knowing all enemy locations). If you're not a developer, which you likely are, well, be prepared take part in an experience that will span tens of hours. Slow and Steady combat : The game features combat mechanics made prominent by classic games. Slow and visceral combat ensures that the players experience and focus on positional game play rather than run and gun. Kiting and Patience are the requirements for succeeding in this horror classic. Modernized Classic Mechanics : Clunkier and loved aspects of classic games such as forcing players to stop and aim, slow recovery times are modernized here to reduce rage. But the game still retains the effect these mechanics had by making them dynamic. ex - Can walk while aiming instead of forcing players to stop and aim. First Person Immersion : All these mechanics and atmosphere the game has is increased by the selection of the first person view. Not only it puts you in the feet of the character, but also increases immersion and takes those terrifying encounters to 11. No more looting and Item management : Having a unique sci-fi aesthetic and lore enables us to create weapons and mechanics that circumvent the chore that is item management and going out of your way to scavenge for loot. Slow health regeneration and overheating mechanics allow the game to be fast, linear and to the point when it comes to narration. Visceral Audio : Not only the enemies, but the weapons are going to scare you too. These high powered futurist weapons sound as they should. From a laser beam to a wrecking ball hitting a building. Just as guns should be. Low end requirements : The development computer being the minimum requirements stated in the store page, the game promises high framerates on most computers available today.",
