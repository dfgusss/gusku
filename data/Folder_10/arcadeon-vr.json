    "About the game": "ARCADEON VR is a match 3 game on steroids. Use the force of your gravity gloves to swap and match drones by colors in different grids simultaneously. While solving levels, drones attack you with lasers and missiles. Special drones offer you power ups: extra time, shield, and missiles while you achieve multipliers by creating series of combos. The futuristic streamline universe of Arcadeon is heavily inspired by cyperpunk classics such as Blade Runner and Tron.",
