On the day of my wedding, my sister-in-law, determined to keep her sister single out of some stupid selfishness, killed and turned me. And that's my story. Kind of a downer, I guess. Two years ago, a hunter named Simona Rinoldt freed me from a decade of captivity, imprisonment I have her father to thank for. We may have saved the world, I don't know. Now we're here, in the Hinterlands, the land of Landis, the land of werewolves. I'd kill every human I see just for a rolled up newspaper and a poop scoop. Actually, I'd kill every human I see just for giggles, but then I'm a man of simple pleasures. I kept telling her to stay out of other people's business. It doesn't concern us. She never listens. And this is what we get for helping people. It's never just helping. It's always something more. 'What's the worst that could happen', she said. I'll try to remember those words when they execute us for regicide. ' From the same developer, do not miss another dark tale: /",
