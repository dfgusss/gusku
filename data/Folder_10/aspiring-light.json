    "About the game": "Synopsis The world is a messed up place. Across the cities, rampant crime and corruption wreak havoc on its inhabitants. But none of this matters in our story. It's all a blip on the radar to Aiden, who's got his own problems to worry about. Things like...what the answer to that last math problem was. Dealing with pressuring parents, and trying to keep his friendships afloat before they drift apart forever. Just wondering about what the bleak future has in hold for him... However, despite his struggles, he's always found solace looking up to the skies. Dreaming of what was to come, as the invention of rockets took humanity out of this world. But the stars just aren't visible from the place he calls home. And they might not ever be. Aspiring Light is a slice of life kinetic visual novel, exploring the minds of our characters as they trudge through their monotonous school lives. There are choices that will slightly change some dialogue and minor events, but they all lead to the same ending. Explore the urban cities, relish in the lush fields, and laze around at home through the perspectives of three main characters: Aiden - A shy, and reserved student. He found much solace looking up at the stars, in order to escape the harsh reality he found himself in. For years, he sought to catch a glimpse of the beautiful trails left by a rocket launching into the unknown. But as everything around him quickly falls apart, that starts to seem like a pipe dream... Kaira - Best friend of Aiden's for the past couple of years. She's been excelling at her studies and is a foodie of sorts. But she does have trouble connecting with others... Damien - A grade above the other two. He's also doing pretty well in school and manages to lead a seemingly ordinary life. But beneath the surface, he's got his own problems... The estimated playtime to complete the story is 3-4 hours.",
