Your delivery isn’t all that’s musical, too - so are the enemies!  Gameplay is set to an expansive EDM soundtrack, and your opponents’ movements and firing rates are dictated by each song’s beat and tempo.  With each round, the music gets faster and more complex, and so do the horde’s capabilities!  Can you keep up with the beat and avoid defeat? Upgrade your space ship and unlock different ship classes to take on enemies on harder difficulties. The upgrades can be reset and redestributed to try out different strategies with different ship classes. Create devastating combos using events and boosts that wipe out screens full of enemies in seconds! Event waves and mini events break up the pace and make for fun, rewarding challenges. Features: Retro Space Invaders style gameplay with a next level roguelite action twist. Upgrade your ship’s attack and defence systems between enemy waves. Mini-events, Booster pickup items and different event waves make for challenging combos. Improve your ship’s sub-system, unlock new weapons and convoy gadgets between runs. Boss battle!  The chief music-hater makes his appearance, and it ain’t pretty! High score challenge!  Compare your scores to your friends playing  Beat Invaders , and try to beat their records! Full mouse, keyboard and controller support. Atmospheric electronic and vocal soundtrack with 22 tracks that sets the pace of your adversaries, making each round unique to its song.",
