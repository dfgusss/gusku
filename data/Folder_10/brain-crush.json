    "About the game": "Brain Crush is a mind, “strategy”, and fast thinking game in a world of 2D. Basically, the biggest goal of the game is to reach a blue portal looking a lot like the main character. The game might improve your real life reflexes and logic thinking as well. Brain Crush contains 2 campaigns with 10 unique levels each + 1 bonus level each, 3 hidden Nightmare levels, 3 minigame levels, and 3 Halloween themed levels! The game is filled with lots of Easter eggs, a hidden storyline, and an unknown amount of secret rooms! Brain Crush is built up in a way that new campaigns and secrets always can be added to the game. That means that the game will keep evolving based on community interest! The 2 campaigns offer a gameplay of 30 to 60 minutes each for a player playing the game for the first time (and without any tutorials watched). Some players might complete the Nightmare levels in 30 minutes, others in 4 hours or more… In Brain Crush Classic you will encounter 5 tool blocks which will or will not help you reach your goal: Balls - Fire - Laser - ? - Spikes In Tech Crush you will be playing as 2 characters: 1 &amp; 2, but only one character can be played at a time. Pressing ESC or BACKSPACE will let you quit the game, so will the red X in your window. The only difference is that the red X won't let you say no to quitting the game! WARNING! Brain Crush can cause a lot of frustration. It is advised to take breaks from the game once in a while. If you keep getting stuck on a level, it is also highly recommended that you play the training campaigns!",
