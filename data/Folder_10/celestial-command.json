    "About the game": "Celestial Command is a realistic co-op crafting survival sandbox space game which unites an orbital mechanics, realistic physics, ship constructor and various features of classic space games. Mine asteroids, salvage space debris, build space ships and stations, manage fuel and energy, trade goods, performs missions and fight against enemies in large open world with realistic 2D physics based on orbital mechanics or in alternative, more classic game mode. Realistic Orbital Mechanic The world of the game works based on simplified orbital mechanics. Everything in state of constant orbital motion. Perform orbital maneuvers and keep your space ships on stable orbits to prevent crashing on a planet or loosing ship in deep space. The physics simulates in 2D space, this makes flying and navigation enjoyable and easy but also generates a lot of interesting situations due physical collisions which are more often in 2D space than in 3D. Galaxy Explore a procedural galaxy filled with various types of stars, black holes, planets, asteroids, space stations and other interesting things which we will constantly add in the future. Fully Customizable Ships and Space stations You can build your own ship part by part. Each part of the ship is individual, it has own functions and parameters. Therefore, abilities of your ship are completely dependent on the modules from which it is assembled. You can build small explorers, large industrial ships, carriers, defense satellites or whatever you want. Each module can be detached or attached to the ship right on the fly, which allows to transform your ship using found modules. Ship Management All resources of the ship are limited. Including fuel, energy, ammo and construction materials, so store them and use them wisely. Command a Fleet You are not bound to a single ship. You can build as many ships and space stations as you want. And you can switch control between them anytime. Also it is possible to control your ships not only directly, but also giving movement orders. Gather Resources Mine asteroids for useful resources or salvage wreckage of broken ships in order to build new modules and produce fuel. Economy, Trading and Missions Trade goods between stations or complete procedural missions provided by NPC stations and earn additional credits to buy new modules on a shipyard. Fight the Enemy Build various types of devices to fight against enemies. Cannons, lasers, rockets, shields and more. The game has now been in active development, so even more interesting features added almost each update! Check our development blog for more information about development and future plans.",
