    "About the game": "Coldfall is a short puzzle/exploration sidescroller game set during the Cold War. Play as a British reporter who has been sent to the (almost) abandoned remote town of Coldfall, which is about to be used for nuclear strike tests. After your car breaks down upon arrival, you immediately find that radiation from other test sites have plagued the town with mutants of the past inhabitants. Explore the town and collect weapons, ammunition and other items while attempting to get off the island before the next nuclear strike hits. Pay attention to your surroundings, always! Keep in mind this game is a one-shot straight play-through: there is no saving. If you die, you must restart from the beginning, so be careful!",
