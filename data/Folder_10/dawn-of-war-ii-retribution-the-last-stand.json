This hero is recommended for more experienced players since he can be very fragile. He can be played as support hero, as a damage dealer or hybrid of both. Farseer The Farseer is mainly a support hero that relies on her capabilities to cast protective buffs as well as hide her allies or teleport them away from danger. The main abilities of the Farseer are Confuse and Veil of Tears which causes enemies to attack each other. The Farseer is also capable of cloaking and teleporting friendly units. Mekboy The Mekboy is a ranged teleporting damage dealer. This hero is easy to start with as the required equipment becomes available early in the progression system. He can also be used as a suicide bomber that unleashes devastating amounts of damage. Captain The Captain is an all-round hero that is good in ranged and melee combat, while various abilities are mainly focused on melee combat. This hero is able to call-down the might Dreadnought to support him and his allies against the enemy invaders. Lord General The Lord General is a defensive specialist who is capable of deploying different types of buildings and infantry squads to assist him and the team. Equipped with these abilities this hero allows the player to explore many different strategies that lead to victory. Hive Tyrant The Hive Tyrant is a slow but hero that cannot be suppressed or knocked down. This hero’s strength lie within his brutal melee weapons that will slice enemies apart and his ability to summon units of Tyranids to the battlefield make him a powerful addition to any team. Shas’O Commander The Tau Commander is an offensively potent hero that fires at range and is vulnerable in melee. In order to compensate for his melee weakness the hero has the ‘unshakable’ trait permanently active and carries a jump ability that enables him to stay on range to his foes. NOTE: The Shas’O Commander is not part of the Last Stand offering and has to be purchased separately here: /",
