    "About the game": "The award-winning cult classic has emerged from its tomb! One part Minesweeper , one part Civilization . With every click of the mouse your empire grows stronger. Spend your turns wisely, and when the barbarians come you will conquer them and re-unite your kingdom. Will your empire stand the test of time? Claim your destiny and unlock the power that lies at the heart of Oasis. Defense of the Oasis is a fast turn-based exploration strategy game. Each level gives you 85 turns to explore, discover cities, build roads, research technology and build as strong a kingdom as you can. When your turns are up, the barbarian hordes attack! If your cities survive the assault, you capture the kingdom's Glyph of Power— if you found while exploring . Capture twelve Glyphs of Power from twelve different levels to win the game. Lose too many battles against the barbarians, and you will lose the game. Defense of the Oasis features four different difficulty levels ( Easy , Normal , Hard and Insane ) as well as nine different multi-level campaign scenarios. All the levels in the game are procedurally generated, for infinite replayability.",
