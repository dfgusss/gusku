    "About the game": "Dragon's Bane is a retro RPG for the 90's kid in us all. Adventure into the Forsaken Lands and engage in turn based combat with the foes you encounter. Be weary, as the Nemesis system will draw increasingly more difficult enemies in the longer you farm their area! Build your Mage Knight as you see fit with the classless character building system. Whether you choose to fight by the blade or use magic, your skills will constantly progress as you use them. Loot weapons, armor, and items during your adventures and craft armor and weapons at the blacksmith from the various ores you find in these twisted lands. Foil the Cultists' plot to summon a world ending dragon before it's too late. Set Infusions: Ever needed the last piece of an item set to drop but you just couldn't seem to find it? Set Infusions have made this a thing of the past by allowing you to find Set Essences in the world and infusing their power with any piece of equipment you want, bringing gear customization to a new level. Classless Character Building: How you play your character is how it will progress. As you discover and use spells your Magic Level will increase, boosting your magical abilities. If you decide to fight with weapon and shield then you'll gain proficiency with that weapon and your shield, increasing your damage/block and unlocking new weapon specific abilities! You'll gain Attribute Points and Skill Points to bolster your stats and Spell talents as you see fit! Crafting: Once you unlock crafting at the blacksmith you'll be able to craft powerful armor and weapons from the various ores and materials you'll surely find on your journey! Some items drop early on in the game and can be built upon to form a more powerful version once enough materials are collected! Nemesis System: As you explore the Forsaken Lands you'll slay various monster types which in turn will dynamically increase the difficulty and rewards from the harder monsters that will surely come after you for killing their kin! This rewards the player for grinding areas in particular and will eventually unlock Nemesis bosses that can spawn anywhere in the zone you've been farming. Spell Customization: You will unlock different spells to help you on your journey through various quests you complete. Once you've unlocked a spell you will be able to spend Skill points that you acquire either through leveling or consumables found in the world to increase certain aspects of your spell! Some gear and gear sets even have added bonuses for these spell nodes.",
