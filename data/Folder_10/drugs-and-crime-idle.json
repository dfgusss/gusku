    "About the game": "Drugs and Crime Idle is a free offline idle game about selling drugs and building your criminal empire. The game revolves around building your drug empire from the bottom, by unlocking regions, dealers, lawyers and thugs. You manage your orders and watch how much your dealers sell. You can then invest the money they make to upgrade them and make them better. Drug prices are as realistic as possible to the real life, so is the turn based combat, which is text based. In the game you can unlock 8 regions, each with it's own dealers and other employees. You can have 64 dealers in total. The base game without the DLC has more than 2000 upgrade levels. Other features are lootboxes or loot crates and item collection. You can currently collect 15 different items trough gambling to make your life as a crime boss easier. The game is free and has no microtransactions. The only real money related thing are the DLCs. The game is being worked on and is not finished. Many things have improved and many more will with time.
