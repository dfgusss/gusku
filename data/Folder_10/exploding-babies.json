    "Release date": "Oct 27, 2021",
    "About the game": "Take control of post-apocalyptic babies blowing up babies using even more babies as ammo! Are you ready to get run over by a roller coaster cart? Drowned in freezing water? Teleported into a slightly different position? Being delightedly confused?Pushed and shoved by your closest friends? All this before you even learn to walk?!?! If your answer is a big, aggressive YES, then welcome to Nutfarm's first creation - the not-at-all-as-nasty-as-it-sounds party game, Exploding Babies! The game is a simple-to-learn one button arena blaster with a surprisingly thick layer of tactics. Thicker than your fingers can handle, probably, after all the crusty snacks you make yourself consume while playing this beautiful thing! CHEESY POOFS! Invite your friends over, grab a few drinks, forget about the fact that you're kind of killing babies, and have a blast! In the current version we have 5 game modes (check below for details), 6 maps with versions for different game modes and 7 messed up baby characters. ONLINE GAMEPLAY via STEAM REMOTE PLAY Even strangers can sometimes be a bunch of babies, show them who´s the boss on the playground. LOCAL CO-OP OR COMPETITIVE PLAY Gather your friends for this adventure of dark humor and mayhem. Play as allies or become enemies. Exploding Babies has super easy controls, shared/split screen option, and full controller support so you can play any way you want. AN EVER-EXPANDING ROSTER OF BABY CHARACTERS From references to politics and horror movies (what's the difference??) to funky caricatures and just basic weird sh*t, there's a baby for everyone. Based on the success of the game we plan to add both free and paid character packs to the game (as well as other content!) SURREAL LANDSCAPES Plenty of levels with custom versions for different game modes. Each level with unique features, traps and other surprises to gawk at and take advantage of. Like with baby characters, we plan to add more based on the success of the game! UNLIMITED REPLAY VALUE Fighting with friends and generally acting like a baby just NEVER GETS OLD, does it?! Also, different friends play differently. Difficulty can be adjusted with quality of friends (difficult friends make the game more difficult! Possibly!) and amount of beer consumed (ask us for each baby's favorite drink and we'll make it up on the fly, we promise). ADVANCED BABY AI May or may not become self-aware in the year 1997. The game modes in Exploding Babies are our babyfied takes on several classics. We have a LooOOoOOOOoong list of game modes planned, which will be implemented through free updates based on the game's success. In v.1.0, we have the following game modes implemented: Last Baby Standing - Survive the longest! A classic free-for-all, where the winner of the round is the last baby standing (duh). After a set time limit, a sudden death mode activates that makes explosions increasingly dangerous. Intense, short matches. Deathmatch - Blow up the most opponents! The babies are DOOMED! A variation of Last Baby Standing with instant respawns and frag counters... The baby with the most kills after the timer runs out is the winner. Also, the NPC babies are bullets. Deal with it. Team Deathmatch - Blow up the most opponents! With a friend! Like above, but the player babies are split into two teams. Friendly fire is ON! Always! Again - the team with the most kills is the winner. Baby Of The Hill - Stay alone within the circle! Another classic. The aim is to stay alone in the circle (a.k.a. 'hill'), which can move or change position depending on the level. The baby who reaches the score limit first is the winner. Baby Pong - Launch babies to opponent's goal! Also known as Baby Soccer, the aim of this 2v2 game mode is to launch the NPC babies (trapped in a bouncy bubble, obviously) to the goals on the other team's side. Cheating is allowed!",
