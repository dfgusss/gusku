    "About the game": "About F.E.X (Forced Evolution Experiment) In F.E.X (Forced Evolution Experiment) you are a failed experiment in a facility where they manipulate human DNA in order to stop the aging process. Something happens in the facility and you manage to escape, but as a failed experiment you are able to grow old at will, but you can't reverse the process. Get out of the lab before you die of age or get caught by other experiments. Key Features: Age at will: You have the ability to modify your age, but be careful you also have a timed lifespan so don't waste it. Choose your way: You can go through the lab areas in different ways, and it will have different sets of enemies, collectibles, and story fragments. But don't worry if you don't visit all the areas in one playthrough, you can play it again and discover all those areas, enemies and secrets will be waiting for you. Get through the enemies: You're not the only one that got out, so beware of the different experiments and other 'people' that will hunt you.",
