    "About the game": "Funny Fingers is an instant-restart action game that is influenced by games like River Raid, QWOP, and Frequency, and that features * No customization of any kind * No feelings * No personal experiences * No lore * No story * No cutscenes * No screenshake * No particle effects * No loot * No XP * No unlockable abilities * No controller requirement (or support) * No tutorial (ok, almost no tutorial) What it does have is * A unique semantic control scheme to puzzle out * Movement-based scoring and combo systems * A constant stream of tricky decisions to make as you control 1-5 ever-shrinking avatars that will get too tall to duck between enemies if they collect too many growth pickups, but that need to collect at least some of those pickups to survive",
