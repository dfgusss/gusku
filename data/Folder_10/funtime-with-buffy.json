    "About the game": "DESCRIPTION Funtime with Buffy is a first-person and single-player horror game inspired by the classical ones but aims to a unique terrifying experience. Funtime with Buffy has a cartoonish art syle which is also the perspective of the little girl that you play as. Your objective is to collect every toy you can find in the house and outside, avoiding to get caught by Buffy. He's challenging you by turning the lights off so you cannot know where it may come from. Buffy's the only one who knows where you are going or where you are hiding. Survive and don't get caught! STORY At first it seems a regular night of a little girl watching cartoon on TV. Suddenly her mother asks to gather all her toys that are scattered around the house. She's leaving her home alone for a while. Since her mother left, Buffy made his appearance. He used to be abandoned in the basement for being a nasty plushie which it was a big mistake. Now all she got left is this 'friendly' bunny. It doesn't seem very friendly at all... He just wanted to play, nothing else. But Buffy went upset because of the desertion and now he wants to take on revenge. All these nights would feel endless when Buffy will haunt you all along... So wherever you are... He will find you. Funtime with Buffy is designed and developed individually for the very first time by Darius Bucataru. Powered by Unreal Engine.",
