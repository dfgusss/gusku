    "About the game": "Ghostory is a 2D platformer designed around switching between physical and ghostly forms in order to solve increasingly taxing puzzles. Despite starting off with a curse, this is a light-hearted adventure, with an engaging plot, retro-styled pixel art graphics, and a wild menagerie of puns. Ghostory won the Best Student Project prize at Game Access 2016. In human form players can interact with levers, pick up keys, jump, and carry the backpack they'll have to leave behind when incorporeal. In ghost form, they can fly and pass through walls. Clever use of both forms is what will allow them to survive and escape the cave unscathed. The game comes packed with dozens of carefully-crafted levels meant to tax your logical and lateral thinking skills and is never afraid to introduce new mechanics and unique puzzles as players venture deeper into the cave. Ghostory, despite its simple controls, always remains challenging and keeps offering fresh, often multi-tier puzzles. Complex, occasionally fiendish puzzles. Dozens of unique levels. Smooth animations, and quality pixel art. Engagingly deep plot complete with rather silly puns. Atmospheric music to tie in with the detailed environments of each level. Smooth and responsive controls. Important mushrooms. In Ghostory, you take on the role of a lone traveler lost in the woods. Drinking water from a weird lake has placed a deadly curse on him, but also allowed him to transform into a ghost and fly - at will. Thankfully, an old and irritatingly funny lady can help him prepare the required antidote, but she will need a very special mushroom for this. A mushroom that only grows in a seemingly safe cave nearby. Surely, nothing can go wrong now.",
