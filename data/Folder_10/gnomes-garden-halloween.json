It read that her uncle Vlad had disappeared without a trace (and possibly died), and the princess was ordered to his castle to bear witness to his last will and testament. She went through all the relatives she knew in her head, but could not recall any uncle Vlads. With her interest piqued, she set off to the castle, but soon her decisive mindset was replaced with trepidation — would she meet him there alive and well, or would she be paying respects to his memory?
