    "About the game": "Story The tragedy of Hinamizawa is over. Those held captive within its grip are free from the fate that bound them to June 1983. Yet the tale of Hinamizawa is not truly complete. There are many worlds not yet explored. Three such worlds await in here, but are you prepared to reveal what was left in obscurity? Saikoroshi-hen This is a tale of Furude Rika reaching the summer of 1983. Her power allows her to choose one of many worlds, but is this world truly the best for her? The difficulty here is malicious, for all you dear connoisseurs who prefer it that way. Hirukowashi-hen This is a tale involving a peculiar dispute over the most precious jewels - the Magatama of Fuwarazu, capable of granting mutual love - which befalls the club members. Batsukoishi-hen Within these pages is a bible of blazing passion for today's modern, apathetic youths! Even though it was meant as an after-party for Meakashi-hen, it completely ruins the impact of that chapter! Deemed too dangerous for consumption, this legendary scenario was sealed away! Continue only if you can vow that you are truly degenerate. Gameplay Higurashi When They Cry is a sound novel. The music, backgrounds and characters work together to create a world that is the stage of a novel for the user to read. They laugh and cry and get angry. The user takes the point of view of the protagonist to experience the story.",
