    "About the game": "HipWitch takes you on a heart-warming journey that invites you to explore its beautifully detailed, hand-drawn world. You'll play as Prom, a young witch who has left the bright lights of the city on a journey of self-discovery. Along the way, you'll meet a cast of quirky characters - some of whom are in need of your help, while others are just there to admire your cool hat. You’ll have to use a variety of spells, a healthy dose of exploration, and the power of 90s dial-up internet to solve the tasks ahead! Key Features: Combine a variety of ingredients in unique ways to create interesting spells such as Mind Read and Animal Speak. Cast those spells on the world around you and see the results. Talk to amusing and compelling individuals in need of your help. While some are struggling with issues of identity, others are just wanting the damned vending machine fixed. Explore and navigate an open, hand-crafted map as you hunt for clues and gather ingredients for your next spell. With the power of dial-up internet at your fingertips, browse a collection of old-school web pages to find spell crafting recipes and other hints that might aid you.",
