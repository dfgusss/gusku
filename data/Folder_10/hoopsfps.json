    "About the game": "HoopsFPS is a first person basketball game where you play head to head against friends and strangers. Attempt to score, steal and dribble across the court without the enemy team stealing the ball from you. It is a first person take on a regular basketball game. In future iterations we would like to add a campaign and bots ranging in difficulty, though the game as it stands is a online multiplayer experience. We are in the process of growing the online community. Indie multiplayer games tend to have a smaller player base and require time to build that base up. Join the 'HoopsFPS Games' to find games easier.",
