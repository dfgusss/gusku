    "About the game": "A quick note from the developers: You want to build beautiful cities without investing hours on end into stressful resource management? Say no more! ISLANDERS should be right up your alley. ISLANDERS is a minimalist strategy game about building cities on colorful islands. Explore an infinite number of ever-changing new lands, expand your settlements from sprawling villages to vast cities and enjoy the relaxing atmosphere. If you’re thinking about buying ISLANDERS please keep in mind that we are a very passionate but small team of three. This is not a blockbuster experience with hours and hours of content. What we’d like to offer you is a simple game that lets anybody create and explore their own little worlds, while providing enough depth for players who want to challenge themselves. And you can get it at the price of a medium sized pumpkin spice matcha caramel latte. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have feedback, questions, or problems with the game. We’ll do our best to get back to you as quickly as possible and provide support if needed. Also let us know if you enjoyed the game, because that makes our day! This game offers you: Intuitive and rewarding city building gameplay Endless amount of procedurally generated islands A relaxing atmosphere Beautiful, vibrant colors Great for playing every now and then, discovering some new islands and beating your high score This game doesn’t have: Helicopters Guns Lootboxes A cinematic story Huge explosions (not even small ones actually) Online multiplayer Microtransactions Orcs Wanna know the specifics? The gameplay of ISLANDERS is pretty intuitive. You start with a set of buildings in your inventory that you can place on your island. Placing buildings is rewarded with points. The amount of points you get depends on what surrounds the buildings when you place them. Gather enough points to refill your inventory and unlock new buildings. Once your city is big enough you may choose to travel to the next island (they are generated procedurally, so you can literally keep exploring forever). If you run out of buildings the game ends. This is where you high five yourself for beating the high score, take a proud last glance at the epic city you've built and start just one more round... ISLANDERS is inspired by amazing games like: Bad North Anno The Settlers Sim City Kingdoms and Castles",
