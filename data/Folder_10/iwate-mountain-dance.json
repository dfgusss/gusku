Take on unique multi-stage bosses in a grand dance of handcrafted fights, each with their own attack patterns and intense combos, as you explore the lands of Iwate and learn its history. Challenge beautiful bullet-hell combat Combine the beautiful screen-filling patterns of traditional bullet hell games with the fast-paced action of modern platformers. Iwate Mountain Dance is about strategy as much as it is about reaction time, with bullet patterns ranging from single-target attacks to spells that will fill your entire screen with danger. Face breathtaking boss battles Bosses in Iwate Mountain Dance aren't just tough enemies. Each boss has its own unique attack patterns, along with multiple high-intensity spellcards to challenge what your skills. Dance along with these spirits of the land as you learn about their patterns and stories, eventually climaxing in a one-of-a-kind final spellcard. Get right to gameplay There is no grinding or leveling-up in Iwate. All bosses are purely a test of what you've learned as a player. Iwate is not a sprawling open world -- instead, the whole game takes place in a densely packed area, with new fights at every turn. The bosses will be hard! But persevere, take your time, and you will push through to see the breathtaking view of what lies at the end.",
