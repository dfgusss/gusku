    "About the game": "Move and rotate pieces to get the laser to hit the goal. Colored lasers, gates, and activators add additional challenge to a relatively simple concept. Customize the background, tile pattern, and laser bounce sound to make the game look and sound how you want it too! There aren't 100s of levels like most puzzle games, but the puzzles that are there can be quite tricky. There are currently 32 levels ranging from easy to extremely difficult. Can you complete them all?",
