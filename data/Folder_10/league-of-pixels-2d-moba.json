    "About the game": "League of Pixels is a fast paced pixel art approach on the MOBA genre, where you don't have to spend 30+ minutes to complete one game. Choose one of many different characters from a constantly rising roster, eliminate the enemy player and destroy the base to gain victory! Average games take 5-10 minutes, so you don't have to worry about spending too much time in one game. The game is free to play, and every gameplay related content is available right from the start. You won't need to grind for Characters! You can decide to play in Online Multiplayer, Local Splitscreen or in Singleplayer, so there is always the right mode for any situation.",
