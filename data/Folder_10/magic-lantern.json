Our stories are well-known around the world, and have been specially adapted for preschool-aged children.

The size of your actual room won’t limit you. You can play Magic Lantern VR wherever you are. - Darts, balls, toy cars, blocks, stuffed animals, a globe and pictures appear in the game as interactive objects – toys you can play with but never break or lose. - Draw on the easel and let your imagination run free – your paint will never dry out, and your clothes won’t get dirty. - Try controlling a toy cat, directing it using a laser pointer. - Choose another language in the game setup for a fun way to learn a foreign language. - Now you have a new playroom, cozy and safe, where children can do almost anything they want and never get hurt. Home is where the magic begins!",
