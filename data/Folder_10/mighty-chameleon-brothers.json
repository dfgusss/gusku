    "About the game": "Mighty Chameleon Brothers is a short indie game created by Gallagher Laird &amp; Kevin McConnell. It was inspired by arcade games of the 80's and 90's. Gameplay consists of clearing enemy insects from a stage as quickly and efficiently as possible. The player controls a lovable chameleon (Lash) with the ability to capture and defeat multiple enemies with his lengthy tongue. Mighty Chameleon Brothers will remind you of old-school arcade classics, with bright and colorful visuals and fun cartoon characters! You'll love the simple yet addictive game play! A lot of work and passion went into this project. Please note that the game is quite short . We weren't able to include all of the things we had planned, but we still hope you enjoy it!
