    "About the game": "In this party-based strategy defence game you will visit distant planets, build small camps and battle fierce monsters. Can you survive by learning and exploiting their weaknesses or is your party doomed to never return home? Gameplay: Fight: Prepare for battle! When the enemies arrive, place your archers on towers and gates and secure the ground with your melee fighters. Build: Build walls and gates to withstand the approaching waves of monsters. Keep your adventurers fed! Do not forget to plant food for your party so they can eat and stay nourished. Prepare: Before starting a map, you can hire new characters, buy new weapons or adjust the difficulty of the map. While each character has unique strengths, you can only choose four characters for each mission, so choose wisely. If you win the battle and complete the map, a new map will be unlocked, and you may be rewarded with gold. Each map takes around 30-50 minutes to complete. Features: - Three unique planets - 15 maps with more than 25 original monsters - 27 weapons to unlock",
