    "About the game": "Net King’s Call is a blend of Turn-Based Strategy and Real-Time Battles! Ever been hit by an unexpected critical hit killing your favorite unit? Have your perfectly planned attacks failed because of an accuracy chance mechanic? Do you want to be part of the action? If you want to control a digital empire while fighting on the front-lines yourself, answer the Net King’s Call! Fight your own battles: Every battle, you’ll be controlling one unit and commanding the rest. Dodge attacks and return fire to deal as much damage as you can to your enemies in quick 30 second battles! Create custom squads of soldiers: Put up to three different units in a squad to deploy into battle. Each playable unit has their own stats and abilities which can be synced with their squad to make your army stronger! Control the battlefield: Move squads around the field to take advantage of the terrain, capture buildings, and beat your opponents back! As technology has progressed, so too has the internet! A new virtual world was created where people can live digital lives separate from the physical. People could explore a new world, build cities, and make great profit. However the entity that held it all together, “The Net King”, mysteriously died. Upon his death came a single message that traveled throughout the net. A challenge. “…whoever is valiant enough to reclaim my estates and restore order, shall become the next Net King…” Individuals and corporations began to search the Grand Network for the Net King’s Castle, but no expedition was successful. Soon there was a power vacuum, factions formed, and war was fought to see who could control this virtual world. Now filled with viruses and hostile programs, the internet has become too dangerous to use by the netizen. Only “Operators” with special rigs can dare to dig through what’s left and create manageable webspace for others who can afford it. As a new operator, can you stake a claim for yourself? Will you be able to find and conquer the Net King’s Castle? Do you have what it takes to answer the Net King’s Call? 'For too long has the Net been in turmoil. The death of the Net King, the mighty leader who united the internet, has resulted in a dangerous power vacuum. There are many who have tried and failed to find the Net King’s Fortress and seize the power within but none have found success. After years of fruitless effort, most have given up on the Fortress ever returning and believe that the Net is doomed to disarray. But a young man has come along, who refuses to accept this fate. Peter Matthews has ventured into the desolate Wildlands of the Net, seeking to reinstate the laws of the Net King by finding his fortress. The journey will be long, perilous, and lined with potential friends and foes. Peter and his allies will be tested at every turn but they will stand firm, determined to finally heed the Net Kings Call.'",
