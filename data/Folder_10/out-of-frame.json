    "About the game": "210801:The 'Out of Frame' official page has been updated with 'Frequently Asked Questions and Tips'. Please use it if you have any questions. If you still can't figure it out, please send a specific question and your save data to the email address in the manual. In the full version, you can start from the end of the trial version. Rename the 'anos_game_tri.sav' in the install folder to 'anos_game.sav' to start it. Story The world's resolution has fallen from VGA to QVGA, an obvious sign that the end is near. To solve this crisis, the Automatic Hero Provision System is used to summon the main character from the outside world. Now, he must borrow the unpredictable power of his home world to somehow fulfill his task. Concept This is a story that can only be told through the medium of games. For this reason, progression involves more than simply reading through the story. Reveal hidden objects and solve puzzles by interacting with elements on both sides of the game window...or even the window itself. Controls Double-click the icon that appears after running the game to start it. Advance text by clicking inside the main window. There are also certain operations can only be done at the OS level, so check thoroughly after reaching what seems like a dead end. Setup It is highly recommended to play this game under Windows XP (Service Pack 3) compatibility mode. Select 'Out of Frame' from the Steam client's library. Click the Settings icon then choose 'View local files' under Manage to open the installation folder. Right-click on Out_of_Frame.exe and select Properties from the menu. Under the Compatibility tab, check the compatibility mode box and select Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Please note that operation is not guaranteed in any other mode. Then double click on the Out_of_Frame.exe file to launch the game.",
