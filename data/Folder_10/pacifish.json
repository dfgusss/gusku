    "About the game": "Pacifish is an incremental fishing management game with several mechanics to interact with and improve. It can be played both idly, or more actively to progress faster. Fish - Acquire and equip poles and tackle to fish in 6 unlockable areas. Fight - Disturbing the waters causes both the fish and the materials to fight back. Earn pixels to improve fighting stats. Hatch - Set up and upgrade incubators to hatch large quantities of fish. Eat - Consume those large quantities to improve stats such as fishing speed and fight stats. Swim - Manually take control of a fish to eat other fish and gain resources. Gamble - Spend your earned coin to play slots, or test your memory in a match game. Craft - Use materials to craft new poles and tackle, as well as create mods to alter pole stats.",
