Find your focus in the space between the sounds, and return colour and harmony to a sumptuous sonic soundscape. Ask yourself - what does a great puzzle sound like? A synesthetic experience: Hear the puzzle, see the beats, feel your way through the soundscape. You make the music: Remix cascading loops of analogue synth and thumping bass. Play it your way: Take your time or attempt bonus challenges – the choice is yours. A library of music: 72 puzzling levels means 72 unique electronic grooves. Perfect sync: Synchronise progress across all of your machines using Steam Cloud saves. DIY: Create your own tracks in our puzzle editor! Extend the mix: Share your creations with other players using Steam Workshop. If you've seen it in the game, you can make it in the editor, then play it instantly!
