    "About the game": "Nu Earth: a poisoned planet where endless war rages between the Norts and the Southers. A futile struggle on a hostile planet with no end in sight. But there are tales of a lone warrior. A man who can appear out of thin air and take out whole platoons, then disappear back into the shadows to which he belongs. A man who knows no allegiance but to his own mission and is hell-bent on revenge. He is the ultimate soldier, the last survivor of the massacred Genetic Infantrymen... ...the Rogue Trooper! Intense 3rd-person action on the battlefields of Nu Earth. Use of Helm, Gunnar and Bagman: Rogue's friends brought to life in his equipment, adding depth to the gaming experience. Ability to create the type of ammunition you want, when you want it. Dynamically use the environment to your advantage - conform to objects and terrain, and fire from protected positions. Athletically climb over the environment to gain the advantage over your enemy. Run, leap, and dive for cover. Use the unique upgradeable abilities of your Bio-chipped equipment to strategically outwit your foes. Intense LAN multiplayer action. Note: Multiplayer available via LAN only.",
