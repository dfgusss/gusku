    "About the game": "Did you say 'explosions'? Play as Herpin, a french lord jealous of the too beautiful castles of his brother. Disguise as a sapper, and try to destroy them with chain reactions of fire, collapses and explosions. Destroy castles... Travel the colored regions of France, find the weak points of its castles and reduce them all to ashes. Each castle is a unique puzzle which will challenge your analytical mind and your creativity. Or build ones! Sapper offers 60+ exciting levels, and if it isn't enough for you, a dedicated editor allows you to create all the levels you want. Challenge your friends with your mind blowing creations.",
