    "About the game": "DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! Max is in trouble. He pissed off his cat Lula and now she’s out to get him. And Lula is far from sweet. She is vicious, cold and unforgiving. And her traps are even worse. Deadly and brutal killing contraptions with Max’s name written all over them. SHE WANTS ME DEAD is the groovy love child of Dark Souls and Grumpy Cat. A side-scrolling, 2D, stupid hard, rhythm-platformer. Unforgiving but also rewarding, in the end. If you ever make it there. Also, it offers a hell of a speedrun challenge. Good luck! (You'll need it!) GROOVY ENOUGH TO SURVIVE? CAZZETTE’S SONG 'She Wants Me Dead' plays a major role in the game. Lula’s traps and other environmental features move in rhythm with the music. Are you groovy enough to help Max find safe passage? Or are you as stiff as the corpse he’ll be when the traps hit? CONTENT Crazy hard platform levels Deadly traps Gold frame achievements A bunch of silly cat pictures Awesome clothes and accessories Steam Trading Cards",
