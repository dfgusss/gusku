    "About the game": "Fast-paced block stacking VR fun! Fill a box with a variety of colorful shapes, then ship the box to earn your wage before the 'workday' is over. Designed for VR, you will enjoy physical satisfaction when grabbing blocks from the conveyor field, rotating them with you hands, then smashing them into their boxes. Pack fast ! These blocks contain volatile commodities and won’t last long outside of their containment fields. The supervisor is watching your every move, so losing a block will lead to a citation and your wages will be docked. Progress through different block orders, upgrading your factory and hiring salespeople to get access to new customers. Orders vary in both the shapes you have to pack and the way you have to pack them: Training - Block Stacking 101 guides new employees through the basics of stacking and shipping. Deadline - Test how productive you can be when under a tight timer (between one and three minutes). The production line speeds up as the deadline gets closer. Endurance - Pack as fast as you can to reach the quota, but earn too many citations for missed or exploded blocks, and your workday is over! Break Time – It is said ‘play is the highest form of research’. Head to the ready room where you can experiment and stack blocks however you like in your off time. No wages earned and blocks are non-volatile. Special Order (Coming Soon) – Come back for a fresh puzzle available every day! These special order customers demand perfectly packed boxes and don’t supply any extra parts, so figure out how to pack them full without wasting any pieces. Enjoy amazing features: Leaderboards track the highest earners Multiple game play modes Comedic story content and training from your management supervisor Easy to learn, impossible to master Eight different box sizes, fifteen block shapes, and three different block types to pack VR-friendly physical controls Color-blind friendly Oculus Touch and HTC Vive support Best for Room Scale VR, but now supports standing room only! Planned future updates: Competitive Online Multiplayer Cooperative Online Multiplayer Motivators and Demotivators to power-up your workday…or hinder your coworkers Performance improvements (always trying to get that better!)",
