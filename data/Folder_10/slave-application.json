    "About the game": "---------- Do you know your true place in this galaxy? Are you meant to serve? Then apply to be a slave to a truly dominant and superior species! --------- Role Playing - But are you really role playing when you are just being yourself? Simulation - You may believe that this is but a simulation of what an extensive slave application process would be like. Choice Matters - How would we ever be able to judge your suitability without your pathetic input? Unique Battle System - To best simulate what it would really be like to have a slave, a mistress, and an automaton in battle. Prospective slaves will have the chance to prove themselves throughout 7 chapters loaded with content in order to pass the application. 1. Stand at Attention: Learn about the process, learn how to succeed in the process and prove yourself. The first part of each chapter will cover the intricacies of the game and what you were able to learn. 2. Serve: Mistresses like servile slaves. You will be put into scenarios within which you will learn what pleases a Mistress. Put on the leash, so to speak. 3. Work: You will be given a specific task in which you shall be expected to excel in. You will wait on an Automaton, a fighting gladiator robot. Your choices will surely make battle rather interesting for your Mistress. 4. Worship: You will have some time to yourself... to worship Mistress Goddess inside your shrine room. Save up enough currency to purchase shopping trips for your mistress so that you can collect new photos to add to your shrine room and worship.",
