    "About the game": "An exciting pixel shooter in the Top down genre, with nice graphics and a captivating hero. The main character is a kula who masterfully scatters his enemies - ninjas to the right and left. You will have to fight a serious boss, after defeating which you will receive a reward. There are a lot of different small arms in my game, but I didn�t forget about melee weapons either. You won't be able to tear yourself away from your computer monitor - this game will keep you hooked for a long time! Management: change weapons, open inventory ,Spacebar - open.",
