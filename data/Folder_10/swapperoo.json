    "About the game": "Swapperoo - The friendly puzzle game intent on your defeat. The rules are simple: tap an arrow to move it in the direction it faces. Make a row of 3 tiles of the same color and the tiles disappear. If that sounds too easy, don’t worry – this game can be devious and you’ll find yourself in situations that require clever manipulation of the game board. There’s an assortment of objectives to keep you on your toes: tiles that chase you, tiles that must be matched within a few moves, tiles that must be protected, and lots more. As well as 38 free-form stages which play out differently every time, we have created 75 challenges with unique solutions, so the game is crammed with content to keep you busy! The INFINITY update adds 3 new modes: Endless, Gauntlet and Timed! Stylish new game from the creators of the Quell puzzle trilogy Catchy jazz soundtrack by Quist Full keyboard/mouse/controller support Crafted with care for PC play.
