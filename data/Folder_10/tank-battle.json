    "About the game": "The game is top-down third-person shooter. Your tank can shoot moving in four directions. Your mission is to protect homeland from the advancing enemy forces. While destroying special types of enemies, you will get bonuses, which will help you to complete your mission. Your friend (if you have one) also can help, if agrees to play in co-op with you. Gamepads are highly recommended. The game is developed on the Unity 3d game engine. It is an attempt to implement in 3d childhood game named Battle City, that was produced and published by Namco in 1985. I am not trying to cash in on this game and do not pretend being unique or new. It just turned out something acceptable from the project. Maybe someone else will be interested to play.",
