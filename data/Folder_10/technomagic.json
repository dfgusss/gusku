    "About the game": "Technomagic is a free MMORPG game that based on Match-3 mechanics. Simply put, you fight by moving stones on the field, but you have almost everything you can get from an MMORPG: battles with other players, a large selection of equipment, ranks, clans, professions, and trading. There are no level 80 elves here. There are no elves here at all. Players are divided into two feuding factions: humans and dwarves. If the humans are waiting almost classic fantasy, the game for the dwarves is much closer to steampunk. Humans have powerful magic and formidable elements. Dwarves improve their technology and deadly mechanisms. According the plot, many years ago the world of Elinor was home to an advanced civilization, but now only ruins and crowds of monsters of unknown origin remain of the former luxury. Depending on your choice, the world will happily open its arms to a glorified warrior, a collector of rare valuables, a successful merchant, a monster slayer, a traveler and an explorer. It's up to you to decide what you will become and what path you will choose.",
