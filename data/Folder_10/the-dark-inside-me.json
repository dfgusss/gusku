Dark Inside Me blurs the thin line between madness and reality, darkness and light, love and hate, forgive and vengeance. You awake in a hospital room, handcuffed to a bed. You hear some detectives speaking about you. They are talking about how you can still be alive after that terrifying event. And one of them says it would be better if they had caught you dead. You don’t understand anything and don’t remember much, but to figure things out, first you should find a way to escape. The first question comes to minds is that are you guilty or not? But this is beyond guilt. You have been given a chance to face your past and how far you would go and sacrifice from yourself to enlighten the darkness and fight with your demons.
