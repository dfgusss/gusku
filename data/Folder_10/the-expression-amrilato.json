Have an intellectual curiosity for learning. Just like watching cute girls having fun. Are willing to take in a touching story that will probably make you cry. Story Rin was just buying a snack in her hometown’s shopping district — but she gets a shock when her surroundings suddenly transform. '...Why is the sky pink...?' She should know this area well, but the unreadable letters on the signs and the strange language the people are speaking have made things unrecognizable. ...Just then, Ruka, a girl so cute she could be an idol, appears and extends a helping hand. Rin, who exudes positivity in spades, and Ruka, a supportive girl who speaks only a smattering of Japanese. This is the story, pure and sometimes frustrating, of two girls intertwined through their fumbling efforts to communicate.
