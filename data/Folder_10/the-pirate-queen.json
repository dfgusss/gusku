    "About the game": "Save Ireland in THE PIRATE QUEEN! The Pirate Queen is an action slasher from Cyberfox Studios. You’ll be frantically swinging your sword to take down a slew of different enemies. Make snap decisions about who to take down first before your rapidly dwindling health runs out! Step into the shoes of Grace O’Malley, a real Irish pirate warlord from the 16th century. You will struggle to carve out a place to survive and thrive in an Ireland packed with feuding clans, and fight to unite Ireland against the threat of the British Empire. THE PIRATE QUEEN features tons of different enemies and bosses that will require strategy and speed to beat, cutscenes giving you a taste of pirate life, and an endless mode to let you really push your sword fighting to the limit! I created THE PIRATE QUEEN after being inspired and excited by Grace’s tale. Every story I heard about her was crazier than the last. I knew capturing the thrill of O’Malley’s life in a game would be something special. THE PIRATE QUEEN is Cyberfox Studios’ premier game, and we’ve loved every second of making it. It isn’t without its shortcomings, but we hope our passion and excitement shines through. YAAARGH! -John Mints II Founder",
