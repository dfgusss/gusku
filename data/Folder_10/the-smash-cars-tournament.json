That's a quite unique and in same time hard tournament because you will have and off-road car which does not slow down at all. Your goal is to pass every mission without being crushed. It probably seems pretty hard at first glance, but once you get it, you will become a true master. Game Features: - No brakes, just an off-road car with a single pedal, the acceleration one :) - More than 50 levels; - As you pass to other levels, obstacles will become more dangerous.",
