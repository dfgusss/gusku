    "About the game": "As humanity’s resources are running out, two astronauts set off to explore other planets to save mankind from destruction. During a routine test on their way back to Earth, spaceship Orion comes into contact with what appears to be a near miss from some debris. Or so they thought. As one of the crew begins to lose their mind, what do you do? Prove your worth or succumb to darkness. Enjoy a short, story-rich sci-fi horror game with psychological elements to the story in which you must come face to face with a new species and save Earth. Enter a New Surrealistic Journey of the Unknown. A Kubrickian tale of Space &amp; Adventure into the Abyss of your mind. Dialogs, cinematics, and a deeply engaging story that plays out before you. Designed with the Boxlieter Method in mind, not only play a game that is engaging, but take part in an unknown test. **Game contains hardcoded subtitles for hard of hearing**",
