    "About the game": "In the year 20XX a confident, young horologist by the name of Strike is inadvertently transported into the past while attempting to repair a mysterious, abandoned clock tower. Endeavoring to return to the future, Strike must fix both the time machine and the island’s dysfunctional family who are responsible for much of the clock’s disrepair. As the spiritual successor to Cat Poke , Tick Tock Isle plays like a puzzle platform game that relies heavily on story, character interaction, creative thinking, and poking.‬ The music and sfx are by  Kevin Carville .",
