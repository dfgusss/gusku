    "About the game": "Jump from platform to platform in this minimalist puzzle platformer. All platforms except your starting platform move at different speeds, some even carry the coveted token. You make a jump from one platform to another at the right moment and try not to fall into the abyss. In addition to the speed, the platforms may differ in size and this brings a challenge to the gameplay. And don't stay on the platforms for too long, otherwise you will lose if you touch the edges of the screen. Collect a lot of tokens and good luck with your game.",
