    "About the game": "Too Loud: Chapter 1 Too Loud is an indie-project that two of us started making back in 2015. We wanted to make something unique: visually and from the gameplay perspective. 'Too Loud' has a deep story behind. As time went by, we started to have less free time and couldn't afford to continue the development at the scale that we've initially planned. However, there is a certain finished piece that we would like to share with all of you, for free. It features about 30 mins of gameplay (1 hour if you want all achievements). We hope that you will enjoy the Atari-styled graphics and dark atmosphere of this Chapter. We are always happy to receive the feedback from you.",
