Each puzzle starts with sad water bears that are desperately in need of water. Help them by building and rebuilding water flows using an ever-increasing variety of pipes. Walk around the puzzles in real space, viewing them from all sides to get ideas. Manipulate myriad colors, test your spatial reasoning, and make the most of your limited resources. There are dozens of puzzles that increasingly become more challenging and an awful lot of thirsty water bears that need your help. It is a VR experience the entire family will enjoy. Water Bears VR is the next evolution of Water Bears , a mobile game that received numerous accolades including the 2015 International Serious Play Awards “Best in Show” and the 2015 CTR “Editor’s Choice for Excellence in Design.” [Standing / minimum playspace size: 2.3m x 2m / ]",
