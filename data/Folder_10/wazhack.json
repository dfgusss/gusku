    "About the game": "Time moves forward only when you do in the dungeons of WazHack, so you can take your time to solve problems instead of just spamming 'attack' and 'drink healing potion'. With over 350 unique items to be found, you will invent your own solutions to sticky situations. With over 170 different monsters , many with unusual attacks, you will find plenty of sticky situations! The procedurally-generated dungeon and vast array of possible items gives immense replay value. Some games you'll find a good weapon early, other times you'll rely on wands or potions or spells. You don't see it much in the all-action video above, but some of the most fun is had just standing still trying to work out how to get out of a sticky situation. Should you try that unknown potion? Maybe it's Healing? What about that wand? Maybe it's Magic Missile... or maybe it's a Wand of Create Monster, and it'll get even stickier! You start with your choice from 16 character classes , each with different starting equipment, stats, belief system, and available talents. The game you play also depends very much on what interesting loot you find. Maybe you'll find a great spellbook and put all your efforts into turning your uneducated knight into a master battle mage. Or stroll through the dungeon as a Bard, enthralling an every growing audience of blood-thirsty but music-loving kobolds. The choice is yours.",
