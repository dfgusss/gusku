Both builds are running on DOSBox with a custom configuration tool. The Enhanced build features fixes introduced in EGwhaven, a must-have community project, which addresses an array of bugs and issues with the game (we'd like to thank ETTiNGRiNDER for the contribution to this release). Additionally, the controls are re-mapped to what you'd expect to see as a default in a first-person game nowadays.",
