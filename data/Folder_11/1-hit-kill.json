    "About the game": "THE BAD GUYS TAKE ONE HIT... SO DO YOU! This 80's-style Top-Down Shooter tests your patience! In a forgotten automated factory, overrun by aggressive units, a free-willed security droid is being hunted by the system... NO CASUAL GAMING HERE! As the title suggests, you will be punished for your slightest error in judgement with an instant Game Over (i.e., this game is brutally difficult)!!! Save panels record your progress, barriers allow one extra hit. Other items and secrets exist too (if you can survive long enough to find them). Just be good enough!!! !!! DISABLE STEAM OVERLAY IN SETTINGS TO AVOID ISSUES WITH CONTROLLER SUPPORT I recommend my custom Xbox controller configuration: 'DV_1' ID: 2722407589",
