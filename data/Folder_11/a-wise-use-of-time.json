    "About the game": "With the power to freeze time, you can ransack a casino, rescue a celebrity, or cheat death itself! 'A Wise Use of Time' is a thrilling 260,000-word interactive sci-fi novel by Jim Dattilo, author of 'Zombie Exodus,' winner of the 2011 XYZZY 'Special Recognition' award for interactive fiction. Your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. When you freeze time, no one can see you, hear you, or stop you, except, perhaps, a handful of mysterious time controllers like yourself. Every second you steal puts more stress on your body and mind. Will you bring justice to the mobsters who run rampant in your city? Will you steal from them to provide for those in need? Will you share your power with friends and family? Will you destroy your own powers, or will your powers destroy you first? Play as male or female; gay, straight, or bisexual. Develop relationships with one of four main romantic options (or a secret one). Track your relationships and moral stats as they change. Level up your time-control powers, or nullify them to protect yourself and others.",
