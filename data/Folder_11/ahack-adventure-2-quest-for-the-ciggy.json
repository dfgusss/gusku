    "Name": "Ahack Adventure 2: Quest For The Ciggy",
    "Release date": "Jul 18, 2022",
    "About the game": "Inspired by open world exploration games from the 8-bit era, Ahack Adventure 2 is a journey filled with genuine secrets to discover, dangerous dungeons to delve through, and a multitude of enemies which focus on diverse behavior and mechanical differences to increase difficulty - rather than faltering to the boring solution of having more health and damage. Ahack Adventure 2 doesn't hold your hand and will require you to think for yourself. However, unlike many of its inspirations, AA2 does not require a walkthrough to finish, with the level and world design silently teaching the player basic concepts they need in order to finish the game. Key gameplay features: -Nine dungeons of increasing complexity that expand on the mechanics of the dungeons before it -A mostly nonlinear overworld to explore, with over a third of all screens containing some hidden secret -Ten playable Ahacks, each with their own abilities. Use a sword beam, throw grenades, walk on water, become ethereal, and more -Three difficulty modes to suit your preference, plus a fourth Nightmare difficulty which is hidden to ensure you don't choose it by accident -No boring tutorials or interstitial narrative, the game pits you right into the action -Nine unique and challenging boss fights, one at the end of every dungeon -A generous save system to ensure you don't lose half an hour of progress from one minor mistake",
