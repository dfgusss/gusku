    "About the game": "Bliss is a quiet and subtle puzzle platforming adventure. Always searching for what he didn't have; the man climbed a mountain his entire life just to find himself alone at the top with a view of all the mistakes he made along the way. In Bliss you are a shadow trapped in a strange world constructed from someone's memories. The world is infected with dark creatures that you have to remove before you can proceed. To your disposal you have a boomerang and a stopwatch that can freeze time. Each level represents a period of a certain person's life as well as a stage in the Kübler Ross model (the five stages of grief). * Challenging gameplay &amp; little hand holding * 5 unique levels * 4 unique bosses * Challenge mode for each boss * Steam achievements * Heavy but subtle story told without words The game is played with a mouse and keyboard.",
