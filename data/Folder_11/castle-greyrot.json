    "About the game": "Castle Greyrot is a party-based rogue-lite RPG with adventure and boss rush elements combined together. That means you'll get your typical rogue-like experience (Randomized stages, equipment, battle bending curses, multiple choices, brutal bosses), but you'll keep your loot, unique heroes, and upgrades forever. The Castle itself is full of mysteries, deadly traps, treasures, and enemies. It is rumored that Castle Greyrot is a living being that changes its location every 10 years and corrupts its surroundings wherever it goes. It welcomes every guest adventurer and feeds on their souls. As an experienced Commander, you are summoned to engage in a raid on Castle Greyrot. With mercenaries on your side, you're about to venture to the Castle and destroy the unknown evil force within. Class-based Tactical RPG 16 Classes to pick from. Starting with Cleric, Thief, Warrior, and Wizard. Yes, our returning hero Time Mage is here as well. Setup your 3 party members to challenge the horrors of the Castle! Unlockable Classes By leveling your previous classes and gradually exploring the Castle you'll unlock 12 new classes that have a vast variety. Secrets Each class comes with its unique skill sets and can help you with perks that uncover the secret of Castle Greyrot. Randomness Everywhere Alternative paths, events and bosses are part of the Castle. Let's pray that we are safe from DEADLY traps and arm-chewing mimic chests! Rogue-lite Experience No perma-death, you can retry battles until you rage quit! Different setup and class combinations are always at your disposal. Permanent Progression Each time your party successfully returns from their boss-killing quests, you'll have a chance to boost your party's stats. Non-linear Levelling Grinding for experience? That's too old-school. We get rid of experience! Class goals are the new leveling system. Do the tasks and level up! Bosses Castle Greyrot is all about boss battles, each stage has 2 to 3 boss battles. With over 50 bosses there are plenty of surprises waiting for you. Can you overcome the challenges?",
