    "About the game": "Every match is a unique strategic experience. Chesstle is an online multiplayer turn based tactical / strategy game where you battle your opponent in 1 vs 1 matches. You begin a match with with 8 soldiers, 2 archers, 2 riders, 2 mages, a champion and a king. Each piece has unique movements, attacks, and health points. Every turn has 2 phases, the movement and attack phase. During the movement phase move your character into the best position, then use any character with an available attack in range to deal damage to your opponent. Take your opponent's king out and you win, nice work. Don't savor that victory too long, your next challenge will likely be harder! Choose your strategy, from an aggressive style that seeks to eliminate the enemy king quickly, to a more methodical approach that allows you to slowly wear down your opponent's defenses. Having separate movement and attack phases allows for some interesting gameplay features: 2 Phased Turns (move and Attack) Varied 'Special' moves that pieces can deploy per match Upgradeable Pieces In depth Player Statistics Ranking System",
