    "About the game": "Do you have spare time? Do you want to do something relaxing? Perhaps you want to grind some easy achievements? Or maybe you're just waiting for a video to load. It doesn't really matter because with Colouration you can play the game and do all that at the same time! In Colouration you have a choice between 5 modes: (1) Calm: Hover your mouse cursor over the dimmed out squares to colour them in. Colour in the whole grid to proceed to the next grid where you will do the same thing. (2) Speed: Test your speed by clicking on the coloured squares as they appear (they appear after each accurate click). You have 60 seconds to click on as many coloured squares as you can. Try to get at least 90 clicks. (3) Perception: You are given 16 seconds to study the board before it disappears. After time's up, one of the boxes is randomly selected and you must determine the colour of said box. (4) Patience: Using the score that you accumulate over time, you need to unlock the progressively more expensive colours on the list. By clicking on the coloured squares, you can generate some score as well. (5) Focus: By selecting the correct components, you need to match the listed requirements. For example, if the requirements are: 3L, Red, and 50%, then you need to pick 3 components, have the last component be Red, and have the alpha level be at 50%. Colouration gives a laid-back and satisfying experience so if you're a casual player (or a competitive player who's on a break), then this is the game for you.",
