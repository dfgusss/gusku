    "About the game": "'To find yourself in a new, unknown world - it's like standing face-to-face with a monster. And so many forget: to that world, they are just as much of a monster.' - the Curator. During the New Year's Eve, the curator of a mansion built on the outskirts of a town invites his protege and her friends to celebrate the New Year together. He gives her an unusual gift. The gift that is never meant to be opened. And only a powerful mage such as her can keep it shut. It and what it holds within. At least, that's what the Curator thought... D'LIRIUM is an experimental 2D-shooter with the elements of a horror game. The game brings together some mechanics back from 90s classics, such as a search for the keys, non-linear levels and a lot of other things. Moreover, the game contains a lot of experimental tricks, such as random events, non-traditional controls for a shooter game, etc.",
