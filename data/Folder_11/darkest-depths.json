    "About the game": "Darkest Depths is a fast-paced, first-person shooter that features RPG elements and mind-blowing movement within a dungeon that becomes more and more dangerous as you traverse deeper. Randomized guns, upgrades, and levels make each play-through fresh and innovative. Key Features QUICK RUNS: If you're short on time then Darkest Depths is the perfect game for you. It is designed to be cleared in a single play-through which unlocks more stuff for future play-throughs. The game can be beaten in under an hour if you know what you're doing. EVERY RUN IS DIFFERENT: Random enemies, random upgrades, random bosses within a random dungeon. You even start with a random secondary gun. You will never know what to expect. OLD-SCHOOL NEW TRICKS: Extremely fast paced movement, OP guns and jump pads akin to Quake. Darkest Depths adds the ability to wall run, unlock up to ten jumps, increase your jump height and a combo system plus more. INSANE UPGRADES: Ice Shards spinning around you like a buzzsaw, enemies' corpses spawn seeker missiles that track other enemies, reaction based Slo-Mo and much more. COMBO SYSTEM: Kill enemies faster to get more gold, exp, a chance at an optional reaction based slow time ability. LOOT CORPSES: Enemies have a chance to drop stat upgrades, health and money.",
