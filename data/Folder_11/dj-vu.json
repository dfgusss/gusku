    "About the game": "Experience immersive and virtual sound works as you move around freely, listening from a selection of more than fifteen pieces from different sound artists. Déjà-vu is an online diffusion platform of immersive and virtual sound works. Created from the 3D digitization of Sporobole’s outdoor space, it recalls the familiar structure of the center. The platform offers the public the possibility to live or relive an experience originally conceived for the sound window, an outdoor linear device of 16 speakers integrated into Sporobole’s building facade. It also showcases works produced especially for this environment, which becomes, here, a creation support in itself. By placing freedom of movement at the heart of the passerby’s experience, Déjà-vu aims at widening the notions of space of creation and diffusion while highlighting the sound works created at Sporobole and making them accessible from anywhere.",
