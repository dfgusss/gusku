Don't Look Down combines the immersive motion of VR climbing with engaging level design inspired by classic platformers. Achieve glory by flinging your way to the top times on the online leaderboards or climb more deliberately to find hidden secrets. Race against the ghost of your best time! Explore 32 levels in 4 distinct zones: Jungle, Ice, Lava, and Tech. Dispatch patrolling bots that shoot at you, pulse electricity, and ram you with spikes! Timing challenges keep you on your toes as you ride drones and swinging ropes, race up crumbling holds, and outrun rising lava. Snag power-ups that let you tank damage, shoot balls of fire, and even fly! Acquire S.C.R.A.P. to customize your character and unlock mods to change up your gameplay! Defeat Gearheart to save the world. Available for Arcades through the Steam Commercial Site Licensing program.",
