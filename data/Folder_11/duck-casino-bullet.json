    "About the game": "Duck Casino is a casual shooting game, in which player is a traveler passing a casino. This casino is very strange. It doesn't gamble with money, but the duck. In every game, one who shots more ducks is the winner. The game rules seem simple, but vice versus in fact. The whole shooting process is with a certain degree of simulation, featuring recoil reduction, scope drift, stamina, physical strength. Ducks will not be sitting ones, and they will fight back against intruders entering the farm. There are several kinds of ducks, each of which has its own characteristics. Some are good at throwing stones at players remotely, while some are good at attacking with paws within a close range, and it is more likely to appear strong ghost ducks at night. And the player is not an onlooker who only needs to click the mouse. When a group of ducks attack you, the player must keep moving to avoid the attack, which means that moving will cause more shaking and it is more difficult to aim at the target. To get the highest score, it is no harm that the COMBO is high, and if NiceShot is triggered by some conditions, you can get multiple scores and play different ways. However, relying on technology is not enough. Don't forget that this is a gamble. Maybe your opponent is lucky enough to hit a very high score, which you have no way to deal with. Features: -Three modes &amp; playing methods: Gamble mode, Heavy machine gun mode, Duck hunt mode -All the weapons can be upgraded -Shooting close-up -Although there are not many props, they can provide various aids to adapt to various kinds of play -COMBO &amp; NiceShot -There exist scenes of day and night. The night scene is darker, and you need to use flashlight -In your spare time, you can catch some small animals in the scene -Magically refitted heavy machine guns -Unlimited ducks, enjoy shooting ———— The game will add other modes in the future, please look forward to it!",
