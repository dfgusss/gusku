After performing an old ritual to cross the Abyss, the Neophyte find himself in a surreal world populated by dungeons and beasts. Find your way out of this ludic world while obliterating thousand of raging creatures, collecting loot, and skilling-up your character. Reality boundaries become blurred while the Neophyte's persona dissociates into three different classes . Customize your character by spending attributes points and increasing your proficiency in many different unique weapon styles . Build your Character Instead of choosing a static class, directly customize your character through main attributes: strength, intelligence and dexterity each time you gain a level, thus, being free to mix your combat style no matter if you're wielding a sword, bow, or staff . Skill-tree and further character-customization still not implemented , but are planned for the final release (after early access stage). Procedural Dungeons Explore fully procedural content and enjoy hand-crafted regions blending altogether.
