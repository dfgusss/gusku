    "About the game": "Dungeons of the dead ... Who knows what is hidden in them? It is only known that they are pulling out of you the vital forces that you need to constantly nourish with food. The goal of the game is to go as far as possible through the levels, without dying at the same time from exhaustion. Skeletons and zombies will stand in your way, beat them or run away - you decide. Infinite pixal roguelike game. Atmospheric eight-bit soundtrack. A lot of monsters in infinite levels.",
