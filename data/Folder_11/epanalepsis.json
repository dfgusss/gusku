    "About the game": "Rachel goes out drinking every night. Anthony plays his videogames. The machinery beneath the world keeps right on ticking. Epanalepsis is a narrative-focused point and click adventure game that tells a story about those connections across sixty years and beyond that pays equal homage to New Wave science fiction, cyberpunk dystopian stories, and the art cinema of the early 1990s. FEATURES Play as three characters in three radically different time periods. Experience an authentically recreated 1990s, a consumerist 2010s, and a cyberpunk 2030s. Hand-crafted visuals wrung from the cramping hands of a very committed developer. Narrative-focused adventure gaming without the stress and trauma of puzzles or inventory management.",
