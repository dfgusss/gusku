    "About the game": "Fairune Collection includes four games in one package – Fairune, Fairune 2, Fairune Origin and Fairune Blast! Fairune is a retro-styled adventure RPG. Our heroine embarks upon a journey to unlock three mysterious statues and seal away a great evil. Throughout the journey she will need to solve puzzles, fight monsters, discover new weapons and improve her abilities. Fairune 2 brings our heroine back for another perilous quest, this time to find a lost fairy. This sequel delivers a bigger world for those that are ready for the challenge. Fairune Origin offers an intriguing look at the beginnings of the IP. It provides a short but fun adventure and illustrates how SKIPMORE conceptualised the gameplay of the two games that followed. Fairune Blast is an unlockable treat, meanwhile, to offer something completely different. It’s a colourful shoot-em-up and a fun diversion from the main adventures! Features: • Fairune and Fairune 2 have been redesigned for this PC release. • Explore, solve puzzles, level up and fight monsters on your journeys. • Simple controls make it accessible to all players ready for adventure! • Fairune Origin and Fairune Blast bring the game total to 4! • Retro 8-bit style visuals, designed for the modern era. • Perfect for headphones with a catchy chiptune soundtrack.",
