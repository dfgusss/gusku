    "About the game": "Parkour is usually very cool and stylish, but today recommended to everyone this game instead with a lovely way to show parkour. The purpose of the game is to make the capsule jump over difficult terrain, perform superb parkour technology, sometimes the obstacles will blend into the surrounding environment, be careful. ESC exits the game and R returns to the starting point It's a pure parkour game, with nothing but parkour. Very moving game story, unforgettable game scenes, carefully carved game characters. None of these, not even BGM. Playing this game only makes people feel miserable. This game is just a tool to torture you.
