    "About the game": "Hell of Sins: soul is a Cthulhu-style horror adventure game (AVG). The story happened in the legendary hell. The male leading role Qin Xuan died and fell into hell, and found that the so-called hell was not the reincarnation place of souls as people said, but a horrible prison with evil ghosts--Hell of Sins. When the souls of the human dead fall into Hell of Sins, it will show its ferocious face. Conspiracy and killing, desire and plunder, struggle and hesitation, darkness and evil are all in it! Facing the horrible evil ghosts everywhere and the human souls that are mad and fallen in Hell of Sins, those souls who have yet been swallowed by the darkness start a difficult journey to survive... =Art Style= In Hell of Sins: soul, we have applied the black-and-white hand-painted style. In our opinion, hell should be a hopeless and desperate dark world. Therefore, the black-and-white painted style is the best interpretation of it. Meanwhile, the deep darkness will stimulate people's fear of the unknown. In aspects of characters, scenes and monsters, we have also learned the style of Mr. Junji Ito, a master of horror, and referred to elements of Cthulhu in the setting of monsters. The combination of these two factors can perfectly show the indescribable horror, and bring you a feast of fear that impact both your eyes and heart. =Features= To make sure that you can completely immerse yourself in Hell of Sins, we have jumped out of the traditional AVG way of telling the story with only scenes and stand drawings, but displayed most of the story with lots of beautiful CG. In some plots, we even have inserted wonderful animations and videos. So when experiencing Hell of Sins: soul, you will find that you are not just playing an AVG, but reading a comic book and watching a movie, too. =Gameplay= As a text AVG, we certainly won't forget the importance of choices. When experiencing Hell of Sins: soul, you will face many choices. Remember, choose it carefully! Because every choice you make will possibly determine your fate, even others’. Besides choices that determine the storyline and trigger different endings, we also have lots of interesting QTE gameplay. Intense, time-limited QTE gameplay will make your journey more exciting. = Gallery System= The gallery system is also one of the unique and important gameplay of Hell of Sins: soul. There are lots of characters, monsters, scenes, etc. in Hell of Sins, and each one has its metaphor, waiting for you to explore. This information can not only help you better understand the whole story, but also open the door to a new world of horror.",
