    "About the game": "A good Samaritan decides to help a fellow man after hearing a scream in the apartment garbage chute. Things don't seem the same as they used to in the hallways though... Hollow Head: Director's Cut is a first person horror adventure game with PS1-style graphics. Experience a dark, intensely oppressive atmosphere and theme - not just a jump scare maze, this one may stick with you after playing. Lovingly made for a 'Haunted PS1' Game Jam, now being re-released as a director's cut with new content, lore, and challenges. Estimated play time: 30 - 90 minutes, or more NOTE: progress is saved automatically. Starting a new game will erase an existing game file.",
