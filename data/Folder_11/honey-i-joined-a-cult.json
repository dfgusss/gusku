    "About the game": "Honey, I Joined a Cult is a tycoon/management game where you must build and expand your base, supervise your cultists and resources, and increase your faith, funds and following! Effective management is at the heart of every money-making enterprise and your organisation is no exception! Being snappy dressers isn't enough, your cult must run like a well-oiled hypno wheel. Set schedules for your cultists, develop their skills, level them up and manage food and maintenance systems. Assign tasks to your cultists based on a priority system. So who said that micro-management doesn't work?! Every great cult needs great interior design. Place, design, and decorate rooms to keep your cultists happy. There is a whole host of weird and wonderful room options and objects, each with a vital role to play in your cult. From polygraph rooms, discombobulator, and spirit chambers to energy spas and the dreaded ministry of alteration. A cult is only as good as its name (and its followers!). Choose yours wisely when picking for your cult, cult leader, the Divine Being that they worship, the Holy Room in which they prove their dedication and the followers that will become the cultists of tomorrow! Make your cult your own by deciding on: *A funky symbol *An epic uniform to impress would-be followers *An imposing hat to make other cults jealous *A strange relic to worship and adore Cultists have needs too and you'll have to ensure that all of yours are fed, watered and having lots of fun! You must take care of your cult's physical and mental well-being to allow them to be the best cult members they can possibly be! It is as they say, cult is only as strong as the cultists! Your cult leader can be very demanding. Whether it's recruiting specific followers or building certain rooms, be sure to bend to their every whim. Not fulfilling demands will lower their mood and a displeased leader won't be able to perform effective sermons. Cultists can be sent on missions in the local town. Whether it's gathering resources, unlocking new tech or just a demand from your leader, the Covert Ops room is the perfect place to plan! Use all your charms to recruit new followers, who will bring in resources and eventually climb through the ranks to become full cultists. Discontented followers will simply leave, so be sure to turn that frown upside down!
