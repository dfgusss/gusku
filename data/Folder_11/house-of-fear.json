    "About the game": "Night. An abandoned dilapidated cabin in the woods. Cobwebs in the corners, dust on the floor, dilapidated furniture and... not a single living soul. From the looks of it the house has long since been abandoned, but is that really the case? You try to understand what’s going on here but you understand only one thing — this house isn’t going to let you get away so easily. Looking around, you see that the doors and windows are shut, there’s no electricity, and the dying flicker of the candle is barely enough to light the murky room. To your horror, you realize that you are caught in a trap. Someone’s silhouette flashes in the dim light of the candle... Or was it a trick of the light? Are you ready to conquer your fears and delve into the secrets of this murky place? Additional information. House of Fear is a mix of genres 'Escape room' and 'Horror'. Player should solve puzzles to escape the house. Gloomy atmosphere and several scary moments will keep the player stressed till the end of the story.",
