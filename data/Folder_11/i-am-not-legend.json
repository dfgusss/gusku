    "About the game": "Game introduction This is a simple game player with a little challenge and luck. It can take a lot of luck to complete the 【HARD】. 1. The scene is a snow town at night. The player's goal is to kill all zombies. The playing method is very simple. 2. Each time we start a new game, zombies will be generated according to the difficulty degree, with different variety number, blood volume, speed and body mass index of anti attack ability, and randomly distributed throughout the scene. 3. At the same time, a certain number of items will be randomly generated in each building. These items include blood replenishment, ammunition, enhanced attack, special skills, etc., but the items will not be generated again and will be gone when they are used up. 4. Zombies will generate zombies again every ten minutes based on the remaining number of their respective varieties. For example, the remaining 15 zombies may become 30 in 10 minutes and 60 in 10 minutes. 5. A little challenging is that it takes time to find items, and it also takes time to find and kill zombies. Zombies need the help of skills and items when they have little time left. All these need a balanced strategy. 6. Item generation and zombie constitution and distribution may depend on luck. Items are randomly generated. If there are enough types and meet the needs, the challenge may be completed soon. 7. With the help of the object Tianyan medicine, you can see the current position of zombies on the size map and the circle on their top in the scene, which makes it easier to find them. 8. Girl zombies have a damage bonus with a hammer, but they are not easy to hit because they lie on the ground. The big zombie hammer has a lot of damage discounts. It's best to hit it with a gun. Brief description The game may be a little rough, because we are a team of five people and four people out. In fact, it is my team alone. I hope this game can be a little fun. At the same time, I also hope to make up the team after bringing benefits and make more and more interesting games in the future.",
