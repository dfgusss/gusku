Simple to learn, difficult to master, with beautifully animated cards and characters makes Infinity Heroes a fantastic game to get into! PLEASE NOTE: If you're an Infinity Wars 1 player or avid card gamer looking for a custom deckbuilder and a larger battlefield, then Infinity Wars Classic is the better game for you. Click Here to access the demo for free, with free public access coming soon. Infinity Heroes is designed to give you faster games with more tactical than strategic choices, perfect for those new to card games or a quick game with no need to create a competitive deck. Infinity Heroes runs in Simultaneous Turns, so while you’re making your turn, your opponent is making their turn at the same time, neither of you able to see what they are planning until both players lock in their turns, and everything resolves. This brings a new level of competitive depth to your game, as you predict, outmaneuver and outsmart your opponent! Will you bluff your way to an advantage? Or maybe superior tactics and mathematical advantages are more your style. Dominate the competition your way! With premade decks, you don’t have to worry about building collections, and spending big on buying packs and card bundles to play the game. On day one, you can be at equal power to someone who has played for years without spending a cent! And, if you want more options and variance in what you play, you can buy more premade decks, or unlock them through in-game play. The winner isn’t the better collector, or the biggest spender. In Infinity Heroes, the winner is the better player. Jump into Adventure Mode, where you take on increasingly difficult AI opponents, building your deck as you go. With an extremely deep card pool, your replayability is at an all time high! Take the framework of a hero power and a core deck in, choosing new card combinations, relics, and ultimates to gain access to. Will you be able to beat all 10 levels and overcome the final boss?",
