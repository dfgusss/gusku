    "About the game": "This tale about getting some tail follows the journey of a boy on the cusp of manhood thrust into the clutches of a sexy demon dog. Stranded on an island our hero Kazuma undergoes training in the secret art of doggy style and any other primal movements his new sexual sensei endows him with. In exchange for studying UNDER Inugami (dog spirit) you have to satisfy her craving for “human essence”. Get her on all fours and feed that animalistic need to breed! Inugami: Doggy Dojo is sweet stirring but also gets a little sticky by the end. If you are a fan of the Norn style visual novels you deserve to have this title in your library.
