    "About the game": "Welcome to Killsquad: a co-op action game that blends twin-stick shooter, hack and slash and drops in a dash of character customization &amp; progression. Join us on a journey to five planets full to the brim with enemies for you to annihilate. Choose your hero, select your skills, weapons, gears and talismans, and unleash hell through waves of relentless enemies and fearsome bosses. Killsquad deliveres frantic, direct, skill-oriented control on keyboard or gamepad. Shoot fast, dodge fast, or die even faster. Our core are short, 10-20 minute adrenaline pumping contracts you can enjoy solo or with up to 4 friends in co-op. So it feels a bit like a twin stick shooter. Or a hack and slash. Or a top-down dungeon crawler. Or a sci-fi bullet hell. Well, it feels like Killsquad. And it's a lot of fun to play, solo or with others. Killsquad features five hero classes for you to choose from, each with their own weapons and skills. These combine melee and ranged characters to fit different playstyles. Along your adventures, you'll be able to acquire and equip powerful upgrades for each of your skills, which activate during your contracts. And, if you survive, claim your bounty to spend it on tons of new equipment, such as weapons, power-ups and gear, or cosmetics to show off. Fight your way through +30 contracts in the Campaign Map, visiting five planets along the way. Jump in with your friends or with any other bounty hunter. You can come to the aid of another squad by joining them mid-mission in real time. Cooperate to complete each contract or compete between each other to earn the highest scores. Obtain weapons and gears with unique characteristics that affect the skills of your hero. Earn the trust of the Unseen by finding their Talismans: strong and complex artifacts with exciting passive effects. But be wary, these abilities at first will be detrimental, but through effort and killing lots of monsters can level up to turn into powerful items. Use everything in combination with your skills and upgrades to create game-breaking builds, and make the heroes your own. But this party would not be complete without the main course: the enemies. Hordes and waves of disturbing enemies will make their way to you, clawing and bitting till there's nothing left. But do not worry, you will be fine. It is the bosses which will make you tremble. More than 15 bosses will put you to the test, each with different sets of mechanics and unique ways to be beaten.",
