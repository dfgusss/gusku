    "About the game": "Key features Up to 14 players 220+ challenges and choices 200+ questions on Truth Fields Up to 500 custom challenges 2 board layouts 2 alcotests (in-game and post game, both optional) 28 kick-ass avatars 3 game modes and board layouts What to expect Want to make a certain someone drink more? Want to slap someone or get slapped? Want to draw on someone's face? Want to do a handstand? Want to flash your goods? Want to call your family and talk for a minute or two? These are just some of the situations you will be put in, you can always drink your way out of these situations. Choice is always yours. The details King of Booze is a drinking game that has no props, it's for two players minimum. It's played on a board similar to monopoly, where you move your character by using dice. Challenges are displayed based on the fields you land on. Since we know drinking games require more challenges than we can think of we've created an option which allows YOU to edit and create your own custom cards where you create challenges but also the 'price' in shots for them. King of Booze also has HALL OF FAME that will keep track of your records in areas such as drinks number, challenges, BAC and laps. Since drinking can be dangerous we also implemented an alcotest. Once you set it up our system keeps track of your BAC making sure you're informed about your state and warned in case you 'overdo it'. Because a drinking game should not only be fun, but make sure you're safe. Thank you for taking the time to actually read the description. Stay awesome ;) Please drink responsibly.",
