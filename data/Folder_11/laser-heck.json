    "About the game": "Laser Heck is an arcade-style space shooter that could be described as 'Bullet-Heck Asteroids'. Intercept incoming enemies before they can destroy your space station, fighting off bombers, fighter-craft, carriers, battleships, and more. Hold out against the unending waves of attackers and their three Bosses, racking up a high score along the way. Play by yourself or with 4 Player Split-Screen Coop in the Endless mode, or have some fun with your friends by playing the Deathmatch, Keep Away, and Racing mini-games. However you choose to experience Laser Heck, it'll keep you on the edge of your seat with high-speed, challenging game-play that rewards practice and precision.",
