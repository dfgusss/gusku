    "About the game": "A Deadly Game Show in a Futuristic Dystopian Society. Fight off never-ending attacks from merciless bounty hunters in the ruins of the city and survive the harsh conditions of the devastated wasteland. Play in a  beautiful  handcrafted  pixel art  world.   Procedurally generated  levels mean no run is ever the same. Tread carefully, because permadeath is on your trail. Buy and implant stims to  upgrade your skills  and increase your chances of survival.  Talk  to people – maybe they'll help you… Some run the black market and have useful gear for sale. Some will shamelessly  rob you while you sleep. Run for your life ! Explore urban districts and the wasteland.  Loot  weapons, tools and food and repair and mod your loot. Repair broken equipment at workbenches in industrial sectors. Pick the locks of doors or  blow them up . Look out for energy stations to  recharge armor, lamps, lasers and other energy consuming equipment.  Hack  into computer systems to access door keys or blueprints for  crafting  loot at 3D printers. Make the Knight's armor glow with the laser gun.  Sneak  past your enemies with the help of the cloak device. Batter bad-guys into submission with the baseball bat. Use the  mind controller  to ‘persuade’ your opponents to work and fight for you. Stun opponents with flashbangs and rob them afterwards. Use a silencer  so the hunters cannot hear you. Pump a load of lead into that stupid laughing Clown!!! Open loot chambers with a nice little package of  dynamite  - after you’ve fought your way through the heavily armed guards.  Dig  for edible roots in the earth of the wasteland and  cook  them for a nutritious meal. Make a  warming campfire  at night. Treat your illnesses with mysterious herbs . Look out for the gift drone that drops supporting loot for you. Find a safe place to sleep to avoid being robbed in your sleep or getting your skull bashed in. The game takes place in a dystopian future where the majority of people live in poverty under an oppressive government. The only hope for a better life seems to be the Lethal Running Game Show, which promises rich rewards to the winners. As a game show contestant, you must ward off never-ending attacks from merciless bounty hunters in the ruins of the city and survive the harsh conditions of a devastated wasteland. You’ll work hard to upgrade skills like gun handling and melee fighting, but you’re not all brawn. You’ll also have to upgrade your engineering skills, find clean water and cure diseases to ensure your survival. Last but not least, you must win over the game show’s audience and become its STAR. You made it! Or did you? Never forget that permadeath is always close at hand…",
