    "About the game": "Macbat 64 is a low poly 3D Platformer and 4:3 loveletter to the late 90s. Classic 3D platforming! A variety of different micro worlds! Different gamplay styles! A lot of unique and characteristic NPCs to interact with! All the 3D platforming goodness from the late 90s is back! Search, Collect and Jump (multiple times in a row even!) like it's 1998! 3D Platforming is not enough? Well, I got some kart racing, 8-Bit minigames, stunt driving 80s cars, First Person shooting sections, 2.5D Sections, a bar full of half drunk characters and a temple full of water for you! ...wait, come back here! The waterlevel is not that difficult, I promise!",
