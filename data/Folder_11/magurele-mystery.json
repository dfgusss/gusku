    "About the game": "Magurele Mystery is a first-person horror puzzle that takes place in Romania, Magurele, Pizdeanu Forest ( a fictional place)! Captain Burcea has been sent to investigate the disappearance of the Pitikok King, but everything has gone wrong when a mysterious beast attacks. The King protected the world for many years from Virgu The Beast. After many years he has fallen and now humankind is in great danger. You are sent to his castle to investigate the disappearance of the king, but you discover dark secrets and your adventure begins. The objective is to find the beast and save the world. Game Features: • Psychedelic horror - Pushing the boundaries of normalcy, the term psychedelic horror is not always just reliant on trying to relate the chemically induced experience. ... Rather, films that fall under the moniker look to explore horror that transcends the safe confines of rational thought. • Story-focused exploration - Explore the dark places of the peoples that you thought they are good and reveal the dark secrets.
