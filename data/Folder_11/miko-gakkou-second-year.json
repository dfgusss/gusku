However, those troublesome youkai are at it again, interfering with the summer festivities happening all over town. From the shining beaches to the brilliant fireworks display, it's up to our three heroines to prevent the youkai from ruining summer for everyone, all the while trying to enjoy themselves and put off homework a little bit longer in this action rhythm game.

Survive to the end of the song while avoiding getting hit to move to the next stage. Key features: Fully voiced game in Japanese, with English subtitles. Six summer themed stages, six mischievous youkai, three playable characters, one for each difficulty level. A total of eighteen challenging rhythm action levels. Normal play, practice play and music room. Completely original soundtrack.",
