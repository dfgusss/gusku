You play as Clementine, a little girl trapped in her own nightmares, with the help of your bubble blower survive against monsters and viewers from all around the world. As Clementin you'll have to survive in three spooyk levels through waves of enemies. You will be equipped with only one weapon, your bubble blower. You can use it to: Blow bubble, building temporary stairs to move vertically and over anything Catch ennemies, you will then have to pop their bubble in order to make them vanish Don't want to die because you fell? Use a bubble as a parachute to slow you down when falling Placed randomly at the start of the game, you'll find bubble gum machines, when you catch it, you'll defend yourself against viewers in differents ways What can you expect to happen while you are trapped in? You better always be on the move, avoid enemies, activate bubble gum machines, etc You'll fight monsters all the time. They'll come in waves, each time stronger than the last one Depending on what type of negative effect (given by viewers) is on, it may be stopped but you'll just have to find the source of it And what can you do if you're a viewers? You'll have to vote between 4 choices that are given to you through the twitch chat, you then simple write in what you want to do to hinder the player's advance.",
