    "About the game": "Nummels are dumb but predictable little guys. They’ll always interact with what’s in front of them, even if it’s a chewed up piece of gum. So toss them a ladder, dig a path, place a bridge, or blast a wall. Get them home safely in this medium skill platformer. Use your brain, they won’t use theirs! Medium skill platforming Nummels can do anything you can do as long as they have the right motivation, but you can run faster and jump higher. This is not a punishingly difficult platformer, but there are challenges for those that want them. Go fast to get on the leaderboard It's fine to take your time and set everything up before letting them loose, but to get good scores and unlock all the things, you'll need to go fast. Accessorize Get coins by saving Nummels and spend them on cool hats! A few Nummels may have been harmed during the production of this game.",
