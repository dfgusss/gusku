    "About the game": "NUMTATE is a challenging grid based puzzle game in which you move blocks around by rotating, pushing and attracting them to solve numeric puzzles. The game includes 50 handcrafted Levels. Each one with another take on the mechanics which can interact with each other to create more and more complex situations. With the help of the Undo/Redo -System, you can go back and forth in your steps, if you made a mistake or want to see the puzzle in an earlier state. If you need the numbers and positions in check, the Mark-System helps you out. An optional color pallete and pattern are available if needed. The Levels in the game are not enough? Create your own levels with the Level Editor and share them via the export function or the Steam Workshop! IN SHORT: 50 handcrafted puzzles Easy mechanics, complex levels Colorblind options Intuitive level editor Custom level export function Steam Workshop support",
