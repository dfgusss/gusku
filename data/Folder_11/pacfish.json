    "About the game": "The indie game, Pacfish is a thrilling, Fast-paced, maze-chase style undersea adventure in which a tropical fish has to interact with other dangerous characters with strategies, while eating all dots scattered around every unique maze. In this game, every level contains an unique maze. Your primary goal is to find the best way to eat all dots. Due to some sea creatures either wander around their territories or hold their grounds, you will have a great challenge to survive. Sharks are difficult to deal with, so you'd better hide and stay still while sharks swim over the coral maze at night to hunt. For every few seconds, a dot turns into a power dot. After you eat the power dot, you are able to fight back against enemies. To win the game, you need to eat all the dots up and also game results are effected by how you interact with the other sea creatures. An overall score in every level will record your achievement and your game strategy. If you prefer a casual gaming experience, you can turn on the easy mode.
