    "About the game": "Prismatix is a fast-paced endless-runner where ones main objective is to beat the high-score. It is a small, yet solid and re-playable game, that you can play while waiting. Furthermore, this game was made out of sheer love and curiosity for Physics, Geometry and most importantly Game Development. I greatly appreciate any feedback, compliment or criticism. It helps me navigate my way through the Game Development career I intend to have. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoy your time within Prismatix. - Berat Hasani, Also Known As Freddols. Gameplay Try not to fall down the Spectrum Lake, as you jump on the platforms, and shoot down the enemies. Will you manage to beat your high-score? Features A fast-paced endless-runner with a highly re-playable gameplay. A variety of enemies, power-ups, and environments.
