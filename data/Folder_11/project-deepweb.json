    "About the game": "The Deep Web. This place is beyond description — you have to see it for yourself. Something that did not pass filters of humanity. Everyone here can finally take off their masks and show themself. Friends or enemies, knowledge or ignorance, life and death — here, everyone can find exactly what he searches for. Project DeepWeb is a deep web exploration simulator. Puzzles are on the surface but answers are deep inside. You’re going to discover hundreds of websites and dozens of puzzles, go through every Internet level — all to achieve your objective. And if you’re brave enough to dig a little deeper, you may see something that was supposed to stay hidden forever. The world of the game is filled with stories and characters, personal tragedies and acts of ruthlessness. Don’t get friendly with anyone here, because you’re just a silent viewer and you’re here only to save your friend… and yourself. Welcome to the Deep Web. It's showtime!",
