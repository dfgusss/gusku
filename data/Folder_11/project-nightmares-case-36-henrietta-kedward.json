    "About the game": "WARNING: This video game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Player discretion is advised. IMPORTANT NOTE: Project Nightmares is a long and difficult game, it requires attention and logic to moving forward. It is a nightmare full of challenges and scares for lovers of the horror genre.. A group of scientists dedicated to studying the paranormal has developed a machine that can induce a patient with psychic abilities into a dream state, linking them to a malignant or cursed object. Project Nightmares is in charge of investigating such objects, discovering the history behind them, and putting a stop to the evil they embody. In the first installment of the game, we will play through the case of Henrietta Kedward. A toy with a dark past provides us with a connection to this malicious old woman; tapping into this connection, we’ll find ourselves in a nightmare set during her lifetime, surrounded by terror and mystery. Every time you play, Project Nightmares will be different. The game was designed so that the experience of playing through it changes constantly; beyond the engaging storyline, the player will never know what’s going to happen next.",
