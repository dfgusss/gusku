    "About the game": "Cartown racers, start your engines! Putt-Putt® and Pep are ready to take your kids on the ride of their lives! Today's the big day as our curious little convertible prepares for the Cartown 500. Redline Rick is eager to start the race, but Putt-Putt® and Pep need a few items before they are ready to roll. Kids join in the adventure as they explore brand-new Cartown locations like Torvil Tractor's farm and Rover's Rocket Drive-in, looking for a safety helmet for Pep. Old friends like Smokey the Fire Engine and Outback Al help Putt-Putt® get to the track in time for the big race. As the grand finale, kids hop behind the wheel for the first time ever as they race their favorite purple car toward the checkered flag at the Cartown Speedway! Kids actually drive Putt-Putt® as he races the speedway! A fantastic original soundtrack will have your kids dancing in their seats! There are hundreds and hundreds of the fun Click Points children love! Out of time? You can save the game and finish it later.
