    "About the game": "Take command of any and every aspect of your corporation, from the large scale decisions of research and territory acquisition, all the way down to the piloting of individual ships, where you focus your attention is entirely up to you. Flexible Fleet Management Order your fleets into engagements with enemy forces or freely take first-person control of any of your ships. When the ship you control is destroyed, instantly jump into any other ship you control. Fully Customized Ships Research new weapons and components to fully customize your ships that support your strategy. Build ships manually or with the help of the auto builder. Your only limitation with placement is based on your ship's available internal space. Granular Damage System Every part of every ship is individually damaged and destroyed. Penetrate the hull to damage the critical systems held within or carefully disable ships to salvage them and reverse engineer their technology. Customize Your Corporation Create your own corporation with unique qualities to suit your preferred playstyle. The bonuses and penalties you select before the game starts will be with you for your entire campaign, defining your destiny’s course. Command as you Will A suite of AI helpers allows you to focus on the aspects of the game you love the most and leave the management of everything else to the AI. Whether you want to focus on developing your cities, commanding your fleets, piloting your ships, or play campaigns with or against your friends, you have the freedom to play your way. Explore a Hostile Solar System As you expand your sphere of influence an AI storyteller will present events and situations which bring new depth to your story. Some events will be random while others begin at the start of your campaign. As your story unfolds, you’ll also face the forgotten colonists of Alpha Centauri, who seek to reclaim their home system. Story When civil war between the Central Earth Government and a collective council of corporate interests suddenly erupts, Earth's Defense Grid is compromised in the chaos. With all ships marked as hostile by the grid, Earth has been fully isolated from the rest of the solar system. You take on the role of a corporate settler who has just been stranded on Mars. Trapped in an underground shelter, your only assets are a Builder Bot, a handful of construction resources, and an instructional contingency AI named Ares. From these lowly origins you must first build a city, and then assemble a fleet of remote controlled warships to secure territory and advance your technology. Be quick about it, too, because you aren't the only one out here. Every other major corporation launched its own settlers to escape the devastation, and soon you'll find that there's just not enough solar system to go around.",
