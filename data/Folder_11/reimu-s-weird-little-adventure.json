    "About the game": "Are You Ready For The...... Stupidest Touhou fan game you'll ever play on Steam... Reimu is bored, like, really bored. Sure nothing happening is pretty relaxing... but you'd probably rot if you stay home forever, so... Go and beat up that idiot ice fairy probably will do the job! except there is a twist, you know there is a twist i know there is a twist everyone knows there is a twist. Featuring Classic 2D RPG game (with crappy art), Silly story that's filed with crappy jokes, and 2 ending, A mix of (boring) turn based battle with bullet hell, 30 minutes of game play, Oh btw This game is filled with stupid references that no one can understand. Last thing This game is made completely by me myself and I with 1.5 years (somwhow) and a handful of different tutorials on how to do stuff, quite a journey if I say so myself, however, the outcome is pretty crappy. The quality of this game...... isn't really remotely close to fantastic, but I really hope you will enjoy it, and have a bit of fun/",
