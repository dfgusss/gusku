    "About the game": "**Previously known as Launch Party** You and your teammates (local co-op) are armed only with a guide book (100+ pages, hyperlinked) to instruct you in your task of launching rockets. Work together to complete complex puzzles by entering codes, pushing buttons, flicking switches and turning knobs in order to win the game! Assemble your team and assign different roles in order to work together and complete your mission. There are numerous missions of varying difficulty, designed to be played by 2, 3, 4 or 5+ people effectively. There's also a custom mission mode where you can balance the game depending on your group size or preferred level of difficulty. The main game is split up into different sections of the launch, with different panels requiring completion in a particular order. Prelaunch panels have to be completed before T-0, propulsion and flight panels whilst the rocket is in the air, and orbit panels whilst the rocket is in orbit - all the while worrying about debug panels. The 100+ page PDF guide book can be downloaded for free by your teammates and includes instructions for the 20 propulsion 26 prelaunch, 11 orbit, 5 flight and 4 debug puzzles that are in the game. The puzzles are designed to be hard, both in terms of knowing what to do and being able to actually perform the operation on time. To alleviate some of this difficulty, there is a fixed mode , where puzzle answers will be the same each time that mission is played (e.g. press the red button on the propulsion panel at 60 seconds). Conversely, random mode has different answers each time and cannot be completely planned. Features Local Co-op 50+ unique puzzles, including 20 different rockets, each with their own launch requirements Dynamically generated missions that provide a diverse range of launches Fun tutorial mode that teaches the basics 35 pre-designed missions of varying difficulty Only one person in the team needs to buy the game in order to play as a group. The other players can access the guide book (100+ pages) for free Single player mode Rockets!",
