    "About the game": "First-person shooters and roguelikes have finally tied the knot! Their offspring, ROGUE SHOOTER, tasks you with navigating a space station run amok. Blast aliens and kick robots in the face as you traverse each level; collecting weapons and gaining experience along the way. How far will you go when death lurks around every corner? Will you reach the 100th level and destroy the source of the station’s corruption? Probably not, but it’s worth a try. GAME FEATURES: Fast-paced and challenging gameplay! More guns than you can shake a stick at! We wish you would stop shaking it though, it’s making us nervous. Level up and pick from the finest perks this side of the Mississippi! High score charts track your best attempts. Brag to your friends about yours, they surely won’t hate you for it! Play mini-games to hack into secure computers. Just like real hacking! You can battle with robots, aliens, and giant carnivorous plants! You can also battle with your low self-esteem and crippling alcoholism, but those aren’t included in this game. Unlock backgrounds, difficulties and enemy weaknesses.",
