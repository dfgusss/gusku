Runeverse has a simple and fun gameplay, we combined the best elements of card games to create a simple and fun but incredibly strategic game. Factions and Alliances. In the Runeverse Universe 6 Factions coexist, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Choose two Factions to create your Alliance, but it's up to you to find the winning synergy! Random Effects? The right amount. In Runeverse you will never find cards that play all the spells played in the game on random targets. Random effects can be fun, but only when used wisely and sparingly.
