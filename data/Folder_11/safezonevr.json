    "About the game": "SafeZoneVR is an interactive survival psychological horror game, you will scavenge the map trying to escape a fallen SafeZone in Melbourne Alabama. A SafeZone once strong and bustling as the survivors flocked to it. After unknown events, It is now deserted and you are the only person alive for as far as you can think. Escape, scavenge, survive, all while battling your own psychological warfare as the darkness floods over you. You will have to flee to the metro and the labs below the city, hide from the unknown apocalyptic killer, and with the help of your radio friend make it out alive. Hey! I made this game as a high school student over the course of three years, learning unreal engine and improving my skills in game development along the way! This was a passion project and I got lots more actual projects coming soon! Check out the discord for help with bugs, give feedback, ask questions, hear development news:",
