    "About the game": "Have you ever wanted to compete in an entirely illegal underground sports game operation between three competing companies for the great honor of your tech!? Enter the Shadow Circuit. Doskoi, Hachimau, and Ikaros63 have shareholders in this year’s tournament -- and you are their representative contender. Face off against the amalgamation of the millenia's newest tech, and prove once and for all which company is superior. Utilizing your gravity whips and anti-G suit, compete for victory in a battle of attrition and points in this high-octane sport. Features: Launch the ball into the other person's goal with your Gravity Whip. Play in Zero-G space, where the only forces that affect the ball are the Gravity Whip and the Gravity Wells Ionize the opponent AI, the opponent's goal, or a Gravity Well for different, helpful effects (will be fully implemented in the near future). Compete against a competent AI that will keep you playing for hours. What's Next? As we continue to develop the game, we hope to implement new game modes and further tweak the AI. About Us: A collaboration amongst a tight-knit group of senior college students, boldly going beyond what they have learned, picking up Unreal, and aspiring to create a unique and successful VR experience.",
