    "About the game": "We spirits are curious things, Zero. We all have a purpose to fulfill, and each of us represents something. And I hope you can figure out what you represent, too. Guess you can figure that out while you're off putting the whole world back together. Soma Union is a galaxy-spanning adventure that returns to the world of Soma! ...or so it would, if your planet had not been destroyed in a great calamity. As you roam through the cosmos to find the missing fragments of your home world, you'll meet a colorful cast of characters and make important choices that may not be as clear as they seem. Soma Union is an SNES-styled RPG that aims to celebrate the classics (and the not-so-classics because they deserve love, too). As you experience this space-faring story, you'll explore vast dungeons, interact with strange characters, fight riveting turn-based battles and discover the fate of a shattered land! Combat is all about synergy and supporting one another! The Role System changes your characters' roles in battle: Fight your enemies with the damage-dealing Power role, or enhance other party members' abilities with the Support role! By utilizing roles to your advantage, you'll be able to achieve great effects that a single party member can't accomplish alone! Embark on a galaxy-spanning quest to put your home world back together again, because this planet can't seem to catch a break, apparently. Unleash powerful Spirit abilities regardless of your current role to turn the tide of battle! Collect valuable Power Gems to skip enemy encounters with the push of a button... or tough it out and exchange them for rare prizes! Fully custom visuals. And a stellar soundtrack by SpecialAgentApe 10+ hours of good ol' son-of-a-gun RPG gameplay. Funny jokes. The heehees and the hawhaws.",
