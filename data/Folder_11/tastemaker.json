    "About the game": "You start with a small, empty plot of land. You'll need to build your restaurant from the ground up by placing walls, doors and windows. Once you have that hard-earned cash, you can buy more land and grow your restaurant. Guests want more than just good food - they care about your restaurant decor too. Make sure your restaurant is well decorated to keep them happy. When you don't clean your restaurant, it will get dirty. This will attract rats. Guests won't be happy to see rats, so it's probably a good idea to keep your restaurant clean. Keep your customers happy by keeping waiting times low. Cook and serve the food as fast as possible. Creating a menu seems simple, but a poorly thought-out menu is the death of many restaurants. Pick your dishes carefully and make sure they are the right price. You also have the option to offer your guests more variety by adding gambling games and music to your restaurant.",
