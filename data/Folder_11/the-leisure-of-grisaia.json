    "Name": "The Leisure of Grisaia",
    "Release date": "May 17, 2016",
    "About the game": "This game was previously included as a bonus exclusive with the first edition of volume 3 of the Blu-ray and DVD release of the anime, 'The Eden of Grisaia'. For the first time, 'The Leisure of Grisaia' has been translated into English as a standalone title for all fans of the Grisaia series to enjoy. This side story to 'The Fruit of Grisaia' is a character-driven visual novel featuring some of the same characters. This time, it's Michiru who takes the lead role in this slapstick comedy. She tries to decide on a new club activity with the help of Sachi and her other friends, but it's harder than it sounds... A laugh-out-loud side story detailing the Mihama girls' school hijinks. For the first time ever, international fans will be able to enjoy exclusively-drawn CGs previously only available to those who purchased physical copies of the anime in Japan.",
