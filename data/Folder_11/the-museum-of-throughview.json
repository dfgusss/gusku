    "About the game": "The Museum of ThroughView is a VR museum unlike anything else. This is the first time a virtual reality app showcases 2d to 3d conversions of famous paintings and old photographs. When looking at these paintings in VR, the paintings themselves can also be experienced in 3d. For each painting or photograph, background information can be accessed. Spread out through the museum are miniature models from which the 3d images were generated. There are a total of 54 paintings and photographs on display from artists such as Rembrandt, Bierstadt, Monet. Included is also a special exhibition of photographs taken in New York before 1900 by Jacob Riis. I hope you will enjoy having a walk through the museum.",
