With the president Blake Orama kidnapped by Ninja Dragon Terrorists, it's up to YOU to get him back. But before you take on ninjas, you're going to have to fight a city filled with loud and rude people first. Will they save the president? You have to play to find out! FEATURES: Switch between 3 completely unique fighters - Lisa, an MMA fighter and Boxer, Bruce, a Jeet Kune Do/Capoeira specialist, and a Brad, a former professional wrestler. Choose from dozens of attacks to create strike combos, grapple combos, and strike and grapple-ombos! Use a mix of real time and COMBO MENU based attacks to tackle your foes! Inflict Status Effects, and give yourself awesome buffs to turn the tide in your favor! Enemies are class based, have their own unique attack styles, and change behavior based on their health. Timeless score by Inverse Phase, creator of such albums as Pretty Eight Machine and the Chipping of Isaac",
