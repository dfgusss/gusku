    "About the game": "Twin Breaker: A Sacred Symbols Adventure is a story-driven brick breaking game molded in the style of ‘80s arcade classics like Arkanoid and Breakout, but with a plot, characters, and meaning! In the early 2300s, Earth is still recovering from a decades-long World War that engulfed most of the planet, except for an isolationist United States that used its power and prestige not to fight, but to reach for the stars. But when NASA’s generation ships disappear in interstellar space, only two pilots are capable of figuring out why. Featuring 40 stages, four boss fights, New Game+, multiple extra features, plenty of story and dialogue, collectibles, a rocking soundtrack, and a fun achievement system, Twin Breaker is an ode to both the past and the future. Twin Breaker's story is written by long-time media personality and podcast host Colin Moriarty. Features: 40 exciting story levels New Game+ 7 unique game modes Loads of power ups Challenging boss fights Story written by Colin Moriarty",
