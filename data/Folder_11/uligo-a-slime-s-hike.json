    "About the game": "You are Uligo the slime, the only slime that can change color. You wake up surrounded by your fellow slime. Fascinated by your ability to change color, they have an idea. You could venture through the caverns, over the volcano and beyond the waterfalls to find the old Urik, the first slime, and maybe discover the source of your fabulous power. The world of the Nine is vast and full of dangers. Will you make it through all the traps and obstacles in your journey? In your search for Urik, you will have to explore the nine worlds, find countless stars to reform constellations and hats to customize your slime. You will have to use every resource available to navigate the world while protecting your slime core. If spikes, lava or enemies were to hit your slime core, let's just say you would have a bad time. As a slime, you can stick to walls, jump higher than people, dash, grapple to certain objects and most importantly, wear a hat better than anyone. As a slime, your stickiness allows you to use walls and even ceilings to move around. Use this perk to slide your way to victory in a set of levels filled with various challenges and obstacles. But be careful even the mightiest of slime cannot stick to walls indefinitely, time and efficiency are of the essence. Your slime, your choices, your personality. You want it red, red it is, you want it purple, you got it. A cap, a rainbow hat, a Santa hat, a beret, you choose. The only obstacle between you and the most fashionable slime to have ever stuck on this planet is finding those hats. Explore the levels to find every last hat available and pick and choose between them as you see fit. Difficulty is not the only thing you can change. The HUD is also customizable, every key can be rebound. We believe that nothing should prevent you from playing the game. Whether it be if you need a bigger HUD or being able to change the keys to play with only one hand, do not worry, there are plenty of options to help you. I like hard games. I prefer casual games. I like a challenging but fair experience. No matter what difficulty you prefer, we’ve got you covered. You can adjust the speed of the game, the number of checkpoints and the difficulty of boss fights. You can change multiple aspects of the game to make an experience that fits your style or that fits your mood. While sliding around living your slime life, you will come across various stars fallen from constellations. Collect every star in a constellation to return it to its former glory. Only the most daring slime can hope to achieve this incredible feat.",
