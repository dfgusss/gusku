    "About the game": "Looking for the new VirtuaCreature? This is the original version of VirtuaCreature that is no longer being updated. Feel free to purchase this version for the original experience, or play the new version for free! VirtuaCreature is a monster care simulation highly influenced by the creature-craze of the past. You'll be responsible for all facets of your creature, and the effort you put in will reflect in how it grows. From baby to beast - it's in your hands! Everything you do influences the growth and evolution of your monster. Create a balance between different activities and healthy feeding habits, and you will have a balanced creature. Abuse the same activity or item too hard, and it will develop high strengths - and extreme weaknesses . Play multiple unique minigames to discipline your creature - Will you train it to physical peak, or give it a more playful attitude? Purchase and combine ingredients to make various different stat-boosting items . Keep track with an in-game recipe book, and craft accordingly to your needs! Everything needs food, and your creature is no exception! Every activity you do while playing drains its hunger in small increments, and you'll need to feed it in-between strenuous activities or risk it getting unhappy. While you're gone, its hunger will drain slowly in real time - so make sure you come back and check on it before too long! Make your creature even stronger through special equipment , obtainable either directly or through special chests - And no, that doesn't mean paid lootboxes . Each piece of equipment has a different type, power level and color, so you'll have to match it best to your beast! Clear timer-based nodes in the Void Mine to obtain chests, money or Synths , a special item that can be used to level up your equipment to be even stronger! As you clear nodes, your ' Drill Level ' will increase, giving you access to better loot pools than before! Multiple Battle Systems! Compete in breakneck-paced Arenas where every second counts - Each enemy prefers one of four ' battle stances ', and you'll have to learn which to use yourself to effectively combat it. Push your stats as high as possible to earn an edge over the competition! Different arena types for each tier of evolution! Multiple difficulties for each type! 'Infinite' arena with increasing scaled difficulty and rewards. How long can you last? 'Impossible' arena with max-level creatures to face off against! 'Max' arena to test a hypothetical maxed-out creature! Once your creature has become stronger, you can participate in Towers , turn-based RPG battles where all your training will be put to the test! Several unlockable sets, each with multiple difficulties - Including secret content! Infinite, Max &amp; Impossible variants to test yourself or have fun! Daily Tower with rotating rewards for every day of the week! As your creature evolves, the complexity of the art increases exponentially - Go from simple 8-bit blob to a fantastical steampunk camel, a rhino layered in Aztec patterns, or an icy crocodile that freezes all the water around it. With over 20 unique designs, your play-through can have tons of variety. Your Creature Awaits!",
