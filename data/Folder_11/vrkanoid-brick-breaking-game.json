    "About the game": "In this game you have the opportunity to swing your racket to your heart's content, hit the ball with all your might, and smash the tiles on the walls to pieces. Modest but pleasant graphics in a futuristic style are waiting for you. And you will definitely like the physics of interaction between rackets and balls! Several dozen different levels are waiting for you. Each of them gives you a goal, for example: - destroy all bricks - don't miss too many balls When you destroy a brick, you have a chance to knock some bonus out of it. For example: - extra ball - a protective field that will not allow you to lose the ball - changed direction of gravity (you will never see this in real life) - turning your ball into a fireball - time dilation (slowmo) For a variety of play, you can change the appearance of your ball and rackets. You will experience very different sensations when playing with different racquets. This is not just a change in visual appearance, but a change in the gaming experience. In addition, the game has perks. Some perks just make your life easier, for example: - racket in the second hand - extra ball at the start - auto-destruction of the last brick And some radically change the game, for example: - complete disabling of gravity - disable bonuses Afterword from the creator of the game: I believe that every game device should have its own brick breaking game. This rule has been true since the days of the zx spectrum, the NES, SNES and the first IBM personal computers. New virtual reality technology should be no different. But I have not found a suitable VR game in this genre that I would like. So I decided to make it myself. And I think I did it. This simple game with uncomplicated but addictive gameplay will help you stretch, turn off all thoughts and have a good rest.",
