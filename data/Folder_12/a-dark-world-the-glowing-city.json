    "About the game": "Update: New character , 3 new endings and some extra items added to the game. It's been years since the nuclear war ruined the world but humanity always find a way to survive. But is that enough? As long as you are alive nothing else matters? No one else matters? Do you accept to be just a pawn working for low life scums? Or will you rise and turn into everyone's hero. Or worst nightmare... Choose wisely(or not) because every choice you make affects how people think about you and how your story will end. Protect or bully people, have a good time with a 'street girl', get robbed, deal with totally random events, hack old tech, pick locks, take a bath(or not). In this game choices really matter, you can recruit some mercenaries or even ghosts to fight for you. There are 4 different characters each one with their own unique abilities and stories. Over 25 endings based on which character you use and your choices",
