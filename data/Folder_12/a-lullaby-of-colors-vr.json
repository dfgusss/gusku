    "About the game": "Feeling stressed? Treat yourself to this therapeutic VR refuge from the real world with procedurally generated realms of gentle sounds, sweet-tasting colors, and breathtaking beauty. Find and catch the bouncing spheres to visit different worlds. Find the perfect place to relax and watch the virtual world go by. There are no enemies, quests, guns, or puzzles. There is no objective other than to relax and enjoy. The experience allows you to experience a simulation of synesthesia, a mixing of senses, where you can see sounds and hear colors . Each 'popsicle' produces a sound that is based on their color, with a loudness based on their height and position. The sounds you hear are based on the colors around you. For more interesting soundscapes, seek out patches with mixed colors, interesting formations, or rapidly moving landscapes. Play for 5-20 minutes before bed, or after a stressful day, or when you're feeling depressed/anxious. By the end of the session, you'll feel much less stressed, more relaxed and happy. You will be able to sleep more easily, and you might even have vividly colorful dreams when you sleep. Features Great for relaxing, open-eyed meditation, or jaw-dropping drug-free tripping Endless blissful landscapes to soar through Infinite number of unique procedurally generated worlds and soundscapes Relaxing and immersive VR experience for HTC Vive or Oculus Rift Friendly for sitting, standing, or room-scale VR Head-controlled steering to prevent motion sickness, or hand controller snap turning for non-360 degree setups Easily save 4K resolution snapshot images of your experience, to share with others, or use as a wallpaper",
