    "About the game": "A Museum of Self and Space should be a reminder of not only the beauty we can bring into the world, but how cruel that beauty can be. A Museum of Self &amp; Space is a series of interactions paired with visual elements that hope to elicit specific emotions from you. AMoSaS is not fun. You cannot win. It isn't polished. Or true. Or fake. It is a collection of ideas being communicated to you by Jack Hart Games. You explore a museum created by Jules, a queer architect whose last work will be an exhibit focused on their failures. Moral, romantic, professional failures. I wanted to make a game where we see a strong nonbinary person old enough to look back on their life and recognize the mistakes made along the way. I don't know if there's a moral or a point in that way. What I do know is that AMoSaS is honest. I think honest works are important. If you any of that sounds interesting to you please support me by purchasing and playing my game.",
