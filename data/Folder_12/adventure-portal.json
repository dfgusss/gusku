    "About the game": "Welcome Adventure Portal is a simple platform that allows players to connect and run their pen and paper role playing campaigns online! It is currently constructed to support 5th edition play. This is a ongoing project that will see additions and improvements as support grows. I built this to be a simple and easy to use alternative to the more complicated and expensive options out there. Adventure Portal features player and gm profiles that hold stats and campaign information, an encounter/world map where players and DMs can place custom tokens -- each with their own information sheets, sizes, names, images, and a sound and music board for storytelling enrichment.",
