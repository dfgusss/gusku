    "About the game": "KEY FEATURES: Manage and build an automated farm using machines and strategy Maintain your relationships with multiple Nations through reputation Navigate tense situations in choice-based visual novel scenes with lasting consequences Gather data through the news and watch the stock market to stay alive Three long years of war. ... A young man filled with spite and resentment. A young woman with nothing left to live for. A father that can't bear to look at himself... Just as the soldiers of the Republic of Arakasha continue to be sent to their deaths, the common people continue to starve. You assume the role of Alexander Volkov , the calculating son of a former Lieutenant who is determined to survive in any way he can. The republic's three-year war against the neighboring Kingdom Of Leiden has pushed the country to its absolute breaking point- and in its final months, Alexander grapples not only with his harsh work but also his decaying mental state. Use diplomacy and economics to build a profitable farm, maintain your relationship with enemies and allies alike- and above all else come out on top. The game is divided into three phases: DAY : Build an automated farm in order to sell crops and make as much profit as possible before sunset. Here you can build machines, complete trades, and research new technologies. NIGHT : Navigate through a visual novel style interaction with a random character. The game currently features many different interactions with multiple routes and ways to complete them. MORNING : Gather intel to use in the coming day and night. Read the news about the state of the war, look at stock prices, and read the mail. ArmaCulture is now fully complete. It was made with the Unity 2D engine, Aseprite, Adobe Photoshop, and FL studio entirely by me. Thank you to all my friends and family members who supported the development of this game!",
