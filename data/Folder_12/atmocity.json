    "About the game": "Atmocity allows you to build impressive, gravity-defying cities. Test your skills as a mayor in the campaign mode with set objectives, or let your creativity go wild in the free-roaming mode. Create vibrant and remarkable cities, which are not constrained by the laws of physics. Construct and manage facilities that produce the building materials, food and goods that a growing city and its citizens need. Set up long-term trade contracts, or trade resources directly to the global market. Implement policies such as tax rates, unemployment welfare and retirement systems, to satisfy the needs of both citizens and local businesses. Features: - Campaign mode with 15 levels to slowly introduce systems to the player. - A vast and expanding variety of buildings ranging from lower class to upper class residences and commercial buildings, from production facilities to universities. - Need solid ground? A retro mode to build more conventional cities.",
