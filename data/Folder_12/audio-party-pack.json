    "About the game": "A party game designed around sound. Includes 3 mini-games featuring 'sound' focused gameplay! This party game is designed with visual impairments in mind as it relies strongly on sound. There are three mini-games, each focusing on a different challenge. You will need a set of external speakers to play. It is available in English, Japanese and Chinese. Three mini-games GIRIGIRI HARVEST: Pay close attention to each sound as you compete for the highest score! Pulling turnips from the field will earn you points, however some of the turnips are actually Screaming Mandrakes. Different Mandrakes have different sounds. If you hear the same Mandrake scream three times, you will score zero points for the round. Players should listen closely to each other and keep moving forward until the very last minute to collect more points! It's a simple but surprisingly exciting game. BURUBURU SHELL: Work together to choose the same themed sound! According to the question, choose a sound that you think is easy to convey, such “sounds like…”, or “feels like…”. If the other player can then guess the same sound, the stage is cleared! Work together to get all the questions right! DOKIDOKI SUBMARINE: Avoid obstacles, find enemies, fire torpedoes! Players are divided into two roles: A 'Sonar player' who uses sound to search for enemies and obstacles, and a 'Pilot player' who steers the submarine and fires/detonates torpedoes. Work together to clear the stage. The Sonar player puts a speaker to his or her ear and tells the pilot the location of an enemy or obstacle. Using information from the Sonar player, the Pilot fires a torpedo and detonates it directly over the enemy!",
