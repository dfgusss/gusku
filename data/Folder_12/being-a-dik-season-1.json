    "About the game": "A young man from a low-income family moves away from his widowed father and his summer love to attend college at Burgmeister &amp; Royce. As he is cast into freshman life and persuaded to join the up-and-coming fraternity Delta Iota Kappa, he'll be exposed to a new world filled with conflicts, alcohol, drugs and sex. Being a DIK is a choice-driven adult Visual Novel (VN). In this game, you play as a young male attending college, and the choices you make will affect the characters around you and shape your character and adventure. Will you choose to play as a nice, caring and romantic guy or as someone more straightforward and daring? The girls in the game have different values and may or may not be attracted to you based on your choices. Can you resist the temptations along the way to get the girl of your dreams or will you relent and just...experiment? Hey, it's college, after all! The game is a Visual Novel and it's made more interactive through optional mini-games and free-roam events where you can explore the current environment. You can purchase boosters, cheats and skills to make the mini-games easier to pass and find hidden items that unlock special lewd artwork and more. Being a DIK Season 1 includes Episodes 1-4: Episode 1 - The Initiation Episode 2 - Maggot Brothers Episode 3 - 100% Episode 4 - When worlds collide Season 1 is packed with 361 animated scenes and over 8000 images. You can expect an 8-12 hour game that you can replay numerous times to experience different paths and girls. Being a DIK: Season 2, and future seasons, will continue the story and be released and sold separately as DLC.",
