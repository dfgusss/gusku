    "About the game": "The world has fallen victim to a deadly virus, zombies now roam the lands. While running for your life you stumble upon a small city. Claim this city as your own, protect it with your life and maybe other survivors will find you. Gameplay You start off fighting zombies with nothing more than yourself and a pistol. Each time a wave of zombies is killed, they come back stronger and with greater numbers, but so will you! After each wave you get the opportunity to fortify the city, buy weapons and find new survivors. Multiplayer Defend the city from hordes of zombies with up to 4 people! Start a lobby with your friends or if you don't have anyone to play with, just use the online matchmaking and battle alongside strangers. Each lobby has the option for voice chat so you do not have to worry about communication. Develop your city You start the game off in an empty city, but you are here to change that! Soon other survivors will join you in the battle against the zombies. Some will give you the option to buy new items while others will help you by either defending your city or by researching new useful items for you. But it doesn't stop there, you also get the ability to place structures around your city to fortify your position. Walls, barbwire, gun turrets, guard towers and explosive barrels are some of the structures you can build to help protect the city. Weapons BiteVille contains over 50 unique weapons. You can obtain these weapons by letting your people research them or by trying your luck in the mysterybox. Each weapon has its own rarity ranging from common weapons, that will help you at the start of the game, to legendary weapons that even the scariest of zombies fear. Progession At the end of each game you earn progression towards cosmetics. You can unlock new skins and a wide array of hats to personalize your character, so your looks feel just right.",
