    "About the game": "Bonsai is a game about curiosity and life. Grow your tree, prune it, and watch over it as it matures into adulthood. The tree will become what you train it to be - you are the mastermind behind it’s path in life. Each tree is unique and procedurally generated to be as authentic and realistic as possible. Grow an unlimited number of tree-friends using different strategies and masterfully sculpt their shapes. Be aggressive and hack your tree down or gently guide it each step of the way, how you tend to your tree is up to you. Since every tree and every species is unique, each play through will be different from the last!",
