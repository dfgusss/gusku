    "About the game": "Get lost in a remote corner, look for the living using an old radio, stare at something blankly while listening to music, try your best to survive—you may have never imagined such scenes but it seems as if they occur every day. In the game, you will be in danger at any time and you need to be courageous and smart enough to survive! Storyline Your adventure will start from Buried Town, a small town in the south. When you disembark from the wrecked canoe, you find there are zombies everywhere. You completely lose touch with the outside world and there is no any track of civil civilizations nearby. While facing starvation, diseases and zombies, how many days can you possibly survive? Tips: Gather supplies. Build shelters. Turn to NPCs, help NPCs and trade with NPCs. Use the “Old Radio” to communicate with other players. About the Developers: The development team consists of three enthusiastic game fans. If you like the game, please introduce it to your friends.",
