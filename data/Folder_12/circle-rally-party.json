    "About the game": "Circle Rally Party is a challenging, family-friendly, 1 to 4 players local multiplayer party game with mini games about doing donuts with cars. Use your car's unique attack at the right time, and collect power-ups to improve your odds. Traffic rules do not apply! Play alone or with up to 4 players on a single PC Quick, customizable matches Destroy other cars with your car's unique attack Multiple mini games related to doing donuts with cars Colorful graphics Training Mode: train yourself As the party leader, you define your own rules at the beginning of each match. Choose which mini game, map and amount of time you wish to play. Do you only want to play 1 round of 48 seconds? It's possible. If you've chosen to play multiple rounds per match, a new - randomly chosen - power-up will be added to the next round(s). This will make each round increasingly more difficult. At the end of a match everyone receives bonus points for their in-game actions. This means it isn't known who'll win the match until the match has been finished. Mini games Classic How many donuts are you able to do with your car in at least 48 seconds? Hopefully your opponents won't mess with you (rare circumstance). Fortunately, there are power-ups to improve your odds! Color the Wheel This mini game is like Classic, but slightly more skill-based. Color as much wheels as you can by doing donuts around them. Don't stop defending your previously colored wheels, because your opponents can steal points from you by re-coloring them. Circle Slam Stay on the target for the longest time. Smash other cars away with your car's attack.",
