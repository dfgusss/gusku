    "About the game": "A killer clown is after you! There are 8 cards scattered throughout each level. Rumor has it, the cards emit a strange sound. So listen carefully! You must find all 8 cards and banish the clown for good. Run, hide &amp; survive in this terrifying first person horror title. And remember, the CLOWN can hear you. How to Survive Be quiet! The CLOWN can hear you and running will only make it easier for him to find you. Explore the levels and listen out for the 'humming' sound emitted from the playing cards. Jump, climb and make your way through a series of mazes and puzzles. Be careful though! Jumping makes a noise and will only let the CLOWN know where you are. Rumor has it, the CLOWN can duplicate himself to make searching for you that much easier. Remember where you've been so you don't end up getting lost! The CLOWN is fast, but you are faster. Sprint to get ahead and out of reach until he decides to stop chasing you. Use your flashlight to illuminate dark areas, be careful though, the CLOWN can hear the 'click' of your flashlight. Find all 8 playing cards in each level to win the level and banish the CLOWN. What are you waiting for? Go and find the cards before he finds you!",
