Jump in for a quick convoy encounter, or launch a full-length War Patrol, seeking out the biggest, most valuable targets. Features: Smoothly blends a submarine simulator with arcade action. Provides the tools for both stealth and offense; you decide how aggressive you want to be. Multiple times of day allow for different play styles. Location-based damage/repair affects the performance of your sub. Random encounter generator for deep replayability. Four difficulty levels. Tutorial mode to help you learn the ropes. Mouse and Touch-screen interfaces. Global leaderboards.",
