    "About the game": "DanceXR is a character model viewer and motion player. It supports PMX(MMD) &amp; XNALara/XPS models and VMD motion format. Unlike other MMD players DanceXR allows almost any motion to play on any model without any manual tweaking or bone adjustments. It doesn't matter whether the model has IK bones or is it in T pose or A pose, the model &amp; motion are adapted automatically on the fly by our unique motion system to ensure the maximum compatibility. There are also tons of built-in features to enrich your experience with your favourite characters models. * The characters breath, blink eyes naturally and can even make eye contact with you. * Multiple procedural (programmatically generated) motions for you to use on your models. Including catwalk, dances and a few other motions. * 'Outfit' feature to modify the look of your model, this can create effects like stocking, latex, fishnet and so on. * 'Motion Override' to modify motion on the fly to change arm and leg pose and incorporate accessories like hoverbike into the motion flawlessly. Just to name a few. More features are being developed added in each monthly update. DanceXR is previously known as Dance Viewer VR (DVVR) and has been supported by our lovely community on Patreon for years. We are now bringing it to Steam to introduce it to wider audiences.
