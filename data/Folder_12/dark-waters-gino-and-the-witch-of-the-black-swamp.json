    "About the game": "About the Game 'Dark Waters: Gino and the Witch of the Black Swamp' is a horror visual novel set in a murky swamp, on the outskirts of an abandoned ghost town. You spend three (?) days in the company of a witch who promises to prove the existence of magic to you, and are ultimately tasked with a choice that will seal your fate. The Story You are Gino Castallo, a young man tortured by his own mundane existence. Your off hours are occupied reading books about urban legends and going on expeditions to the sites of alleged hauntings. There has to be more to life than... this, right? However, you always seem to end up empty-handed, and today is no different. But this time you stumble upon a swamp during the long trek home from yet another pointless journey. A woman who claims to be some kind of benevolent witch offers to show you her magic. This is the proof you've been waiting for... isn't it?",
