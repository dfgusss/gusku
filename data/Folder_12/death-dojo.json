    "About the game": "Enter Death Dojo... A one-on-one death match to become the ultimate samurai. Real battle is scary. Other games may lead you to believe you can slash through hoardes of foes with ease. This is not true. To beat your enemy you must face your fears. In Death Dojo you must face your nightmare and defeat him. You have nothing but a Katana to defend yourself, the enemy comes quietly and quickly, and you must defeat him with a swift blow to the neck. Do you have what it takes to beat him? Only Time Will Tell.",
