    "About the game": "Desaturation Point is a student game developed by seniors from the University of Utah's Entertainment Arts &amp; Engineering Program. Join our Playtesting Discord and look out for Devlogs on our website for more information about development. ❄ ❄ ❄ It’s winter at Arctic Research Station Delta. The last planes have left for the season, stranding the station’s inhabitants alone in the dark polar months. At 0835 hours, three of the station’s researchers return from a routine surveying trip to find the base in ruins. Something terrible happened, and our three intrepid explorers are determined to find out what… Navigate the twisted halls of the once-bustling Station Delta for clues. Normal environments dissolve into the freakishly colorful as you delve deeper into the base for answers as to what happened. Avoid roaming psychedelic entities as you investigate the base. Will you freeze up in a tricky spot and hope the creature doesn't hear you, or run for your life? Make chilling decisions with your limited resources. Your party is limited, but your options may be less so when you've been cornered by a monster. You decide who will escape with their lives. ❄ ❄ ❄ Submit your arctic research! Join our Discord or check out our Community Forum to let us know your findings after playing Desaturation Point. Mission control appreciates your contributions!",
