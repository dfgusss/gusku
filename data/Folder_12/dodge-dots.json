    "Release date": "Feb 2, 2022",
    "About the game": "Quite possibly the world's simplest game: move your white dot and collect blue things while avoiding black dots. Seems easy enough, right? Well ... try to get the world's highest score and we'll talk again, okay? Features Super simple 'just one more try' gameplay Play with keyboard or gamepad Steam Leaderboards 12 Steam achievements NEW! unlockable player skins via Steam item drops dreamy licensed music by Imphenzia Liner Notes: Yes, this is an obvious knockoff of Dodge by serial asset flippers INFINITY BRIDGE ... err, INFINITE BRIDGE. I was bored one day and wanted to do some coding so I remade that game - only without using an asset kit and with full Steam implementation. And for free because that's all this game is worth. I had a Steam Direct slot gathering dust anyway so why not? Speaking of asset flips, I'm trying to fight them via my Steam group, Asset Flip Reviews . Join if you like and if you want to support the cause maybe buy the completely optional (and useless) DLC for this game? All revenue goes towards writing more reviews to help other gamers avoid paying money for games they shouldn't have paid money for in the first place. Unfortunately you can't review games without actually buying them so yeah ... it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",
