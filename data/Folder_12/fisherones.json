    "About the game": "Get beneath the scales of a little blue fish and dive into a vibrant, living, breathing world and uncover its mysteries. Explore every nook and cranny of 3 vibrant biomes: a coral reef, a kelp forest and a rocky ocean floor and all the lost and forgotten beautiful sites within them. At the start, you will find yourself at the very bottom of the food chain, so in order to survive you will have to be quite careful. While the ocean has no shortage of cozy little spots to hide in, there is no shortage of hungry predators that can snatch you in seconds, either. Through exploring the environment and hunting down other marine life, you will unlock powerful new mutagens and upgrade your arsenal of abilities, becoming stronger and deadlier. These abilities and mutagents offer you a wide range of possibilities on how you choose to deal with the environment such as -Surprising your foes with critical stealthy attacks -Blending in with other fish to evade predators -Becoming so poisonous that the predators regret they decided to bite you -and many more The question is how high up the chain can you climb before you become some other creature’s meal…?",
