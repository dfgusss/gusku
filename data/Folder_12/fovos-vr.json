    "About the game": "'You know, what surprised me most, was not that they went that far with genetic mutations. Or, that somehow this god-knows-what strain popped out in somebody’s system and started spreading. Nah, that’s child’s play compared to their crazy plan. They tried to hide it. You think I’m joking, right? I wish I was. Truth is, they never stood a chance. We never stood a chance.' Fovos is a post-apocalyptic horror, rail shooter for the HTC Vive, set in a future where an omnipotent AI is taking over human brains through genetic implants. Even if you survive, will there be anything left to live with? Game Modes: Story-driven Single Player Campaign Survival mode - Fight against hordes of incoming zombies to rock the leaderboards (leaderboard integration coming soon)",
