    "About the game": "Grey Phobia is a Hack and Slash, third person shooter game, which is based on post apocalyptic, sci-fi, comix scenario. X+Y year. The sun becomes a red giant star. 'Apocalypses' is just a word created by human. It by no means can describe what at that moment is going to happen with the human race. After this breach nothing will remain the same. The World with its history will fade away in infinite fogs. For their wastefulness and extravagant nature people will face that moment unprepared. Instead of taking thorough care to secure its survival, humankind wasted priceless time given for the illusion of comfortable life. The sun which was always associated with the day and life, no longer justifies its magic name. Now the name “sun” has change to “Grey Phobia” as its rays no longer render the colors except gray and red. Not in vain these colors express the fear of emptiness. Grey Phobia features: - Exciting comix story with great campaign - Millions of zombies to kill - Upgrade your equipment to face the upcoming zombies assaults - Equipment crafting system - Complete all achievements and quests to gain more powerful gear. WILL BE UPDATED WITH NEW CONTENT! STAY TUNED! Enjoy the game!",
