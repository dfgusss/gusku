From ERS games comes the HOPA classic Grim Façade with another exciting case to solve! A masked vigilante calling himself the Avenger has the town of Coldstone in a death grip of fear, and you’re called in by the mayor to investigate. His wife’s been kidnapped, and there’s a blacklist of potential targets for the Avenger’s wrath. Can you stop him before he strikes again, or will you be crossing another name off the list? Special Achievements, a humorous alley cat, and hidden masks you can collect throughout the game make this one a winner!
