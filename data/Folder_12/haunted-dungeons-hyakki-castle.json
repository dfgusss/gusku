    "About the game": "The 2 Party System has been improved for better combat! When you divide your party into 2, the group you aren't controlling turns to stone and has greatly increased defense. Some Yokai cannot be attacked from the front so use your stone companions as shields and strike your foes from behind. Enjoy thrilling battles never before seen in Hyakki Castle! Each floor has been revamped and improved with new mechanisms! Every floor has been reimagined with new and improved traps, mechanisms, and Yokai placement. New mechanisms and floor layouts have been replaced to improve the play experience! Yokai with new powers and behaviors! From teleporting Gaikotsu Yujo, to Gyuki suddenly striking from the ceiling, certain Yokai have gained powerful new abilities! Battles with Boss Yokai have been revamped! Most boss Yokai battles are completely different this time around. One change for example: the 2nd boss, Haragao no Mure, advances through 3 rooms. In the final room, a Shokandama and multiple fakes will appear. Make sure to attack the real one! Choose from 3 control settings! You can choose from 3 different control settings for your gamepad. New Tutorial floor added! When you start the game, there will be a tutorial introducing the 2 Party System and how to utilize it. You no longer fill your stomach when leveling up or using a save point. In the castle, you must eat the food you find to recover HG and sleep to recover HP and MP.
