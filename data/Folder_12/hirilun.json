    "About the game": "Hirilun is a dark and strange city, full of hidden places and high buildings. Although anyone can get in, only the fastest will achieve fame... You will need to move very quickly, running and jumping nonstop, going through all the checkpoints, and reaching your goal. You will be able to dash, sprint and plane, but use these skills wisely, as they are limited. Each level has a multitude of different paths; which will be the fastest one? You'll have to find out... Collecting the experiences that you will find along the way will make your timer stop temporarily. Still, it may not always be worth the detour... Compete with your friends and in world leaderboards that are updated every day. [/url",
