    "About the game": "Libe is a puzzle game in which once you start moving you can't stop until you hit a wall. Playing as a sentinel, you're falling short on energy and you need to collect energy prisms to get your power back to fight darkness. - Somewhere between light and darkness, sentinels are what's keeping the world secure from darkness' dangers. As one of them, you wake up to your energy being stolen, and sense the menace growing. Your journey to retrieving your light begins, and many obstacles are on your path. SLAB BASED Libe is a slab based puzzle game, in which every movement is decisive and which in you'll have to step up your logic talents to finish the hardest levels. From slabs that stop, redirect, turn, teleport, block, or can even destroy you, you'll have to carefully look at where each path can lead you to, to eventually reach the exit. 50 LEVELS Plan ahead your next move to not get stuck or get vaporized before reaching the exit of the 50 different levels and pick enough energy prisms to bring your light back to life. Without your full energy you can't stop moving until you hit a wall or interact with certain slabs so you have to be careful what will be the consequences of your choices.",
