Gameplay Collect new dice by investing in economy buildings such as farms, workshop and markets. Some new dice will come with new resource types! Place your buildings strategically! For example, workshops make new dice but will also repair surrounding buildings, beacons increase the range of surrounding buildings and menhirs create new magic dice, but will produce more slowly if other buildings are close by. Plan your dice and let fate decide your future! If you're trying to build a specific thing, you can hold dice so they won't reroll. Features 13 different resource types 4 boss fights over 40 different buildings/actions to play 2-4 hours playtime depending on how fast you play",
