    "About the game": "HEROES NEVER DIE, THEY JUST REDEPLOY IN HELL! In the final days of WW2, a desperate Nazi war machine embraces the occult. The maniacal Major Strauss plans to open the gates of Hell itself. The Mad Devils are deployed to thwart this unhinged plan, but sometimes, heroism isn’t enough. Defeated and damned, the Mad Devils regroup in the underworld for one final mission. SIX DEMONIC GI's, SIX SETS OF POWERS, SIX PATHS TO VICTORY Cast into the abyss, the revenant Sergeant Jack Asher explores hell to reassemble his fallen squad. Each team member has been warped here, twisted and gifted demonic powers. Your expert crew are now armed with elemental and ethereal magics. Master them all and finish your fight. FIGHT FIRE WITH HELLFIRE It’ll take more than guns to smash the Nazi’s demonic ambitions. You’ll need the most chthonic weapons you can get your hands on and enough magic to light up the stygian void. Collect demonic crystals to empower weapons, develop your powers, and earn experience through violence. HELL ITSELF: MORE THAN FIRE AND BRIMSTONE The netherworld is a strange and varied place. Large parts are a perpetually-burning wasteland, others are twisted reflections of the mortal world, dense with choking overgrowth, frozen by sombre winds or fortified by damned Nazi legions. NAZIS: WORTH KILLING TWICE JUST TO MAKE SURE Hell was bad enough before WWII. Now it’s a warzone, populated with undead, ravenous demons and a legion of internal Nazis. They didn’t get the message when they died the first time - time to repeat the lesson, loud and clear. FEATURES Play as one of six unique characters with their own upgradable weapons and powers and fight side-by-side with either a friend or AI squad mate Enjoy a rich story campaign penned by UK author, Dr. Greg Buchanan , whose credits include No Man’s Sky: Atlas Rises , Paper Brexit and Metro Exodus Use upgradeable demonic powers and WWII inspired weaponry as you wage war against Nazi Monsters Unique cover system, a mix of levels with procedurally generated areas and destructible set pieces",
