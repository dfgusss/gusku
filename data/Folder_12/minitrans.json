    "About the game": "Game Introduction MiniTrans opens up a precedent for macro regional planning games at the scale of metropolitan and urban agglomerations. Players can freely plan and construct urban areas in the huge regional space, develop the main city and satellite cities, expand the population, and freely determine the spatial form of the city and the region, earn taxes by transporting commuters and facilitate population mobility. We have selected more than 30 well-known urban agglomerations or metropolitan areas around the world and divided them into Bay Area cities, coastal cities, capital cities, wasteland cities and inland cities. Game Features Covering levels of dozens of city maps in five types, with a long game time. Familiar metropolitan circles and urban agglomerations, maybe there are cities where you live. Regional maps based on real city textures and satellite images; multiple types of transportation and minimalist art design. The data layer displays core metrics such as traffic flow, traffic density, population, road mileage, railway mileage, etc. A tense and relaxing level mode, a more challenging hard mode and an infinite mode that provides players with ample funds. Five city types Bay Area Cities: San Francisco Bay, New York Bay, Tokyo Bay, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and more Bay Area cities that you might not expect. Seaside cities: such as Sydney, Los Angeles metropolitan area, and San Diego, Rio, Dalian, etc. Inland cities: Chicago, which is a benchmark for inland cities in the world, Memphis, which has a huge cargo airport, China's Chengdu metropolitan area, Wuhan metropolitan area, etc. Capital cities: London, Seoul, Beijing, New Delhi, Washington, Madrid, Canberra... Maybe the international capital cities you are familiar with. Desert cities: Phoenix, Dubai, Cairo and other cities next to the desert. Later Improvement We will continue to optimize the player interaction experience and simulate a more realistic transportation system and taxation mechanism. The city map will continue to increase and improve. Add the game plot mode, players will follow the plot to experience a lively and interesting construction process. Add the player's free drawing mode, the city area map can be drawn by the player himself, and realize the open world in 2D. Feedback Exchange Player communication QQ group: 457981600.
