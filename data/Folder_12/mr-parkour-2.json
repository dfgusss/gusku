In this 2D parkour platformer you have to jump over precipices, circular saws and traps on the way to the cherished crystal. Especially for fans of Mr. Parkour, we have released a sequel that is not inferior in complexity to the first part of the series. Mr. Parkour will test your keyboard and nerves for strength over 40 adrenaline-filled levels. All sorts of traps, bottomless abysses, sharp circular saws and dangerous lasers will stand in your way! Even the platforms themselves under your feet can become your enemy and disappear! If even this could not stop you on the way to victory, then you are a real parkourist! But don't relax until you reach the last level.. Game Features: - 40 levels with increasing difficulty - Old school gameplay - Awesome pixel art graphics - The game has Steam achievements - Control your character via the keyboard or the gamepad",
