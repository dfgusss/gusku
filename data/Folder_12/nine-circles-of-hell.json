    "About the game": "The only escape is down through the center The game board is a set of concentric rings, each inner ring lower than its outer neighbor, with a set of sloping notches cut at various intervals. Your set of marbles starts in the notches of the outermost ring. When a ring is rotated, a marble will drop through any aligned notch. Drop through the center and you leave the board. Clear all your marbles from the board and you win. Play solo against different computer strategies. Multi-player against others in the Steam Community. Select from various game options for number of players, count of marbles, starting positions, scoring, exit constraints, ... Configure the board and marble appearance. Game play is based on a physics simulation of ramps and rolling balls. This is a purposefully slow-paced, non-violent, turn-based game that gives you plenty to contemplate as you consider your next move.",
