    "About the game": "Offscreen Colonies was originally a non-interactive demonstration of graphical, musical and programming prowess. This VR version transports you right in the middle of the futuristic landscapes to be able to enjoy the experience from a whole new perspective. While this artwork was built using advanced procedural content creation techniques, it was driven purely by the desire to create something visually and aurally extraordinary. As it was produced as a spare-time project, the VR edition - like the original - remains free to enjoy for all.",
