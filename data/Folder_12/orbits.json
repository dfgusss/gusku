    "About the game": "Orbits is a game where you, a sentient flying shell, annihilate all your enemies - in SPACE! To accomplish this noble mission you can shoot spines, create an impenetrable shield, teleport and heal yourself. There are also upgrades you unlock from beating optional bosses or hard levels. In terms of content, I've made 100 levels that introduce new mechanics, iterate on them, and them combine them for some challenging experiences. I've also spawned 20 crazy bosses that tend to take mechanics from nearby levels and play with them in weird but and very challenging ways (or create new mechanics for fun). I spent the last 3 years of my life seeing how much fun I could create for a very simplistic set of abilities. This game is the result of plenty of crazy ideas brought to digital life. I make no promises that you can beat this game but I do promise you will have a lot of fun trying. Best of luck (especially with the boss 'War').",
