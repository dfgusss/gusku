Welcome to Ostrofa, where you’ll be challenged to use your survival instincts and combat skills to survive in a randomly generated, low-poly environment, fighting other players around the world! Collect resources to stay alive Food can be found on your or resource islands. Look for apple and orange trees, mushrooms, vegetables, and berries. You can also hunt nearby animals, which can provide a good amount of meat. If you are looking for something more sustainable, there's always an option to create a plant farm or build fish traps! Explore your surroundings Stay away from the dark - there are a lot of wild creatures watching you. Carry a torch or build a campfire to keep yourself warm and scare them away. A sharp axe or gun might come in handy. Collect Life Shards These pretty blue crystals called Life Shards are the most valuable treasure you can own. It is very simple - the first player to collect and deposit 15 of them or the one who has the most on the day 20 , wins the match. They can be retrieved from either killing the bosses or looting supply drops. Find valuable gear The best way to survive is to get the best gear in the game. Chests are scattered all over the map and contain very, very exciting and worthy items. Be as quick as you can to loot them first! Crafting What will you need to fend off aggressors of your territory? Weapons, Traps, and Tools! The blueprint panel next to your inventory grants you the power to craft and will be one of the most essential skills you'll need to survive in Ostrofa!",
