    "About the game": "Juno is a girl living in Gaiapolis, who works hard everyday to become independent. She started working in data salvage because she heard that it pays well, but as a beginner, she just can't seem to increase her income. If only there was some way to increase her skills so that she could tackle more difficult assignments... Just as she's thinking this, the AI Prae, who lives in her head, suggests a certain game. The title of the game is Packet Queen and just playing it increases one's technical abilities. Juno lightheartedly decides to give it a go, unaware that the game conceals an outrageous secret...! Divide up the packets that appear one after another, and aim to get a higher score than your opponent. This is a competitive-type active solitaire game where you aim for a high score by gathering the necessary packets while avoiding specific colors and putting them together in poker-style hands. There are 39 stickers to collect based on how you play. Includes VS Mode where you can compete against other players over the Internet. Aim for a high rank after completing story mode! * Powered by 'CRI ADX2 (TM) LE'. CRIWARE is a trademark of CRI Middleware Co., Ltd.",
