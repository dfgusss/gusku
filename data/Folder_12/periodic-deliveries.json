    "About the game": "Relax as you build and direct an ever-expanding galactic transportation empire. In Periodic Deliveries, you are the owner of an up-and-coming space shipping company. Ship the goods each planet produces to planets that demand them to make profit. Use your funds to add more ships to your fleet and expand your reach to new solar systems. Grow Your Empire Research new technologies to unlock better ships and higher-quality planets. Upgraded planets work faster and produce new, valuable goods, but they also have additional demands. You must meet all the demands of a planet to upgrade it to a higher tier, so continually evolving your network is a challenging and rewarding puzzle. Build an increasingly complex web of trade routes until you run a trading empire for the history books. Automation Planets periodically produce goods. Once you've defined a trade route, configured its import/export policies, and assigned a ship to it, that ship will automatically ply that route for you, constantly bringing in money for you to use in other parts of your expansion. These routes need no maintenance, and the resources never expire, so any changes you make are your own choice. Once you've set up your network, kick back and watch your empire automatically generate money for you as you plan your next addition – at your pace. Simple and Complex The mechanics of the game are straightforward: define a trade route from one planet to another, shipping a produced good to a planet that demands it. However trade routes cannot cross, and your company can only operate a limited number of ships. As you upgrade planets, you'll need to start transporting new goods across a densely established network to unconnected planets that are difficult to reach now. You'll drop off and pick up goods at many stops before they make it to their destination. Deciding how to allocate and transport limited resources in an dense ecosystem is a challenging puzzle that will entertain for hours and hours. Manufactured Technology In order to acquire new technology, you must manufacture and consume technology tiers - a special good that must be manufactured from other goods. These items are complex to produce but well worth the effort, giving you points to spend in the technology tree on additional ship designs, company abilities, and higher planet levels. Features • 45 Goods • 5 Technology Tiers • 7 Ship Classes • An Infinite Experience",
