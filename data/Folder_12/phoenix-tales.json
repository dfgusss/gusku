    "About the game": "Something strange is happening in the land of Rydanthia. You arrive in the town of Northern Cross and quickly discover things are not what they seem. Merchants tell stories of nearby towns that are deserted. There are frightening creatures lurking in the forest. Can you solve the mysteries surrounding this threat? Can you live to tell the tale? A CLASSIC ADVENTURE GAME At it's core, Phoenix Tales is an adventure game. Modeled after classic point-and-click style games of the 1990's, you'll have to use your wits to solve the puzzles. RPG ELEMENTS Gain experience and level up your character as you progress through the game. With individual stats and several weapon / armor upgrades to find, Phoenix Tales is an RPG-lite experience too! A UNIQUE COMBAT SYSTEM While you'll need your brain to solve the mysteries plaguing the town of Northern Cross, sometimes a little brawn comes in handy too. Master a unique combat system that requires both timing and strategy! MULTIPLE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS Sometimes being a hero requires help. Along the way, you'll meet a companion who will prove to be quite helpful on your quest. He has his own play style, attributes, and attacks. A FULLY IMMERSIVE AND DETAILED WORLD Using real world locations and motion capture actors, which are then 'cartooned' into a unique art style, there is plenty to see, do, and explore.",
