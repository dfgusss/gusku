    "About the game": "Plague M.D. is a medieval medicine simulator. Become a quack doctor stuck in a backwater village in the 16th century. Your task is to diagnose and cure the patient using the available tools, ingredients, recipes and books. This is a difficult game against time, misdiagnosis and procrastination can lead you to the stake, and every choice has consequences. Well, what can you do? At first, your methods are scarce - drain blood, amputate a rotten finger. But over time, you become increasingly sophisticated, learning therapeutic treatments and surgical skills. Eventually, you face the horror of black death and put on a plague doctor mask. The visual style of the game is pleasing to the eye. Each model is lovingly hand-drawn on paper. Real diseases and authentic treatments. The bloodletting? Leeches? Yes, please. And don't forget a blow to the head instead of anesthesia. Lovable characters. Our favorite is the parish priest in a deep depression. It is recommended to treat it with St. John's wort. All events of the game take place in a fictional universe. Please do not use the healthcare skills acquired in the game on real people - it is dangerous and can cause harm to life and health. Always contact a specialist!",
