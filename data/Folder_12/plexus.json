    "About the game": "Plexus - an experimental 2d shooter with RPG elements, non-linear passage and a global map, where the player will move between worlds, exterminate crowds of monsters and avoid dangerous traps. Battle - All in-game weapons have two shooting modes; - You can also collect powerful active/passive spells that create black holes or give invisibility. Global Map - The player explores the world of the Plexus, moving through the levels of four biomes (Factory, Cave, Aether, Chaos). Each biome is beautiful, dangerous and unique. - Between fights you can choose the next biome to pass or bypass a complex level on the global map. RPG elements - Component system of the ship, large number of guns, engines, armor and, accordingly, assemblies of ships. Walkthrough - Visiting each biome in its own way changes the whole world of the Plexus. - Replaying is actual: the player himself chooses the order of visiting biomes. Random item drop strongly affects the available tactics (warrior/stealth/manipulator).",
