    "About the game": "Puzzling Peaks EXE is a hilariously mind-bending physics puzzle game about a spherical hero named Knightly, a highly confident administrator named Jasmin, and a quirky, artificially intelligent guide named A.I.D.E. INNOVATIVE STORYTELLING​ The unique recipe for storytelling that handed us several industry accolades is refined and expanded upon to craft a memorable tale for Puzzling Peaks EXE. We use a combination of stunning pixel art, music, and unique narrative techniques to paint a charming postmodern story that will keep players intrigued and entertained until the end. 100+ HANDCRAFTED CHALLENGES​ This game features a distinct gameplay mechanic: our hero cannot move on his own, so you’ll have to rotate platforms and manipulate environments to launch him around a beautiful 16-bit world. You'll need logic, brainpower, quick reflexes, and unconditional trust in A.I.D.E. to pass more than a hundred highly polished levels. You’ll be surprised that it doesn’t get old. INTENTIONAL AND UNINTENTIONAL COMEDY​ Our testers have been enjoying some of the game’s philosophical jokes, and moments that weren’t meant to be jokes. POSSIBLY SPOOKY​ This game may contain horror elements and digital beings that could scare you. Given the history of our games, it wouldn’t surprise us anymore. Note: Audio is required to progress through the game.",
