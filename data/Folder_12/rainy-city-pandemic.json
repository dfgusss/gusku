Get ready to make deliveries for Betty's Pizza in this story-based game set in a cyberpunk future where the pandemic never went away. You're a worker with a mission- your sister Naomi is getting sick, and you need to raise enough money to get her into treatment before she gets any worse. Navigate the streets of Rainy City while delivering to people scattered around town. You'll meet customers from all walks of life- from friendly neighbors to illicit party animals and miscreants. Listen to how their lives have changed and how they're dealing with the pandemic- and reflect on your own history too. Not everything in Rainy City is bleak- there's hope and optimism out there if you're looking for it. Can you make enough deliveries in time to save your sister??
