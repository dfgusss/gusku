    "About the game": "REVO is a neon styled and classically inspired space shoot ‘em up with an original, retro fueled synthwave soundtrack. Inspirations include Galaga, TRON, and The Last Starfighter. If you’re a fan of the video arcades and science fiction movies of the early 1980’s, you’ll love this game and find it both familiar and fresh. You’ve drifted into a sinister space storm far from civilization. Dark ships quickly close in on you. Rescued by a mysterious symbiotic vessel, your only hope of escape is to equip for combat and fight for your life. Features Manage limited ammo and replenish as you destroy enemies. Collect combat debris to build extra ships and ammo drops. Fight a distinct boss ship in each region to unlock weapons. Change your loadout between battles as often as you like. Enjoy an original synthwave soundtrack and bask in neon glows.",
