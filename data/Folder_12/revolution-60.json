    "About the game": "Revolution 60 is a deliberate mixture of two games, Heavy Rain and Mass Effect. Players will control Holiday, a trained assassin as she navigates the orbital weapons platform, N313. They will make the decisions that will make her mission succeed or fail. Players will make moral choices and live with the consequences. Will they side with Minuete, the rogue commander hellbent on completing her mission? Or with Amelia, the engineer determined to figure out what went wrong?",
