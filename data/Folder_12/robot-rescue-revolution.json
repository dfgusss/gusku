Plan every escape with precision and execute each action with cautiousness as the synchronized movement of the robots hinders a simple plan! Unravel over 100 levels of challenging robotic fun in this unique and quirky puzzler! COMPETE OR CO-OPERATE WITH BUDDIES Join forces with a buddy and use each other’s robots to help one another escape from these obstacle-ridden mazes in Co-op Mode! Be careful! As soon as one robot goes astray it’s GAME OVER for the both of you! And if you're feeling a little competitive, then take the logic battle to a whole new level and fight it out to the finish line in Compete Mode! Race on two identical but separate maps and test each other’s quick-thinking skills to see whose robots will escape the maze first all in one piece!
