    "About the game": "ROM: Extraction is a fast-paced homage to the classic arcade shooter, featuring an unprecedented style of VR gameplay. Welcome to the year 2076, where you now have the power to slow down time--called 'Reflex' power. You'll play as a member of an Orb Extraction Unit, on your way to extract highly volatile energy matter--Orbs--from chambers on the moon. With only a few minutes to defend yourself against the onslaught of alien-built robots protecting the chambers, discover the immense satisfaction of decimating those ‘bots via your 'Throw, Slow &amp; Shoot' combat strategy. As of Feb 28th 2017, ROM has been updated with a new expansion, entitled “Overrun.” Overrun is a whole new level for players to master, featuring several unique twists on VR gameplay. Your journey to the escape pods continues through the depths of the extraction vessel. The ship has been overrun! Systems are malfunctioning, and you must face highly dangerous enemies on the lower levels of the ship--and escape to the planet surface with your life. Gameplay Use Orbs in combination with your pistol to “Throw, Slow, and Shoot” Shoot Orbs in proximity of enemies for the most strategic kills Use the environment to your advantage--be on the lookout for destructibles Grab the two-handed EOS-15 rifle when you shoot the floating gun token Use the EOS-15 to “Launch, Slow, Shoot”--a new twist on the core game mechanic that gives you an orb-launching, auto-firing weapon of destruction When “jumpers” are in close proximity, use your pistol or EOS-15 to pop off their heads! Key Features Experience having your full arms in VR Engage in an exciting new style of VR gameplay--wield the power to slow down time, and use it as a weapon Three modes of play for each level: Normal - Hard - Survive Leaderboards: See how you stack up against your local and global Extractors Achievements: Earn up to 15 different Steam Achievements Cooperative social screen feature: Play in a room with others in real-time--enable your friends to see a top-down view of your gameplay Killer soundtrack featuring the music of Delta Heavy and Twin Moons (aka Le Castle Vania) Continued expansion of the ROM universe through future content updates More modes of play More levels Co-op multiplayer Character skins (multiplayer) Enemies with new attributes Power-ups and orbs with special properties",
