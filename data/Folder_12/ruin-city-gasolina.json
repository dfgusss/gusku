We would like to recreate the battlefield of men partially equipped with mechanical gears and military machines equipped with artificial intelligence. What will be decisive in this war? Mind or steel? Nearest future. The city is engulfed by fire and swarming with hostile robots. You are a combat unit with an artificial intelligence thrown into a hot spot to eliminate the invasion of mechanical invaders and save what remains of the once great city. Clean up this city with a bunch of weapons for tactical and assault strategy fight. Considered enemy AI will make a good chalenge war. Enchanced grafics gives a post-apocalyptic ingame feel",
