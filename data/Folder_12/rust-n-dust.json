    "About the game": "Rust 'n Dust Is an open-world action-adventure game about a young city droid who winds up in a big scheme of the villains of an old western town. Wrongly accused of demolition, CC-37 must confront these villains in order for him to clear his name. During his journey he can complete missions for the local friendly droids to obtain valuable items or information, making it possible for CC-37 to uncover secrets that have long been hidden underneath rust and dust. The journey decisions are yours to make. Do you want to attempt to get a high rank by finding all the secrets or would you like to skip quests and try to set the fastest speed run record? The game offers players multiple ways and play styles to finish the story. Obtaining higher ranks will unlock more bonus content. The game can be played with a keyboard and mouse or a joystick. **This game features a photo-mode (press P / Start) where it is possible to hide the user interface, control time and weather and apply a depth of field effect for making nice screenshots. While it is possible, it is not recommended to play the entire game in photo-mode. See in game control options for more info.
