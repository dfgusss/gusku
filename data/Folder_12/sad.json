    "About the game": "Sad :') is a simple game which tries to speak solely through its gameplay (with a little hint from its title). Sad :') is a small arcade game with just one endless level: move naked around your bubble trying to be happy by staying near others, but be careful not to get hurt, the game will end only if you want it to end. The gameplay follows 3 simples elements: Stay near the other characters to increase your happiness Avoid getting hit (or hit first) to keep moving Various power-ups will help you with your life, happiness and bubble size This game has been made solely by me in a couple of sleepless nights, it will receive minimum support as I'm working on other projects, but I'm thinking about updating It with some achievements or hair. I'm publishing it for free mostly because I'm curious about the reception.",
