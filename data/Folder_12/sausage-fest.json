Maps &amp; Game Modes Sausage Fest has different maps you can choose from, each with their own unique features that can influence how the matches play out. Choose how you want to play: Split into two teams and work together, or go at it in free for all to see who's truly at the top. Power-ups Take advantage of power-ups that spawn from the monuments in every map. Whether it’s to regain your health and last longer, do more damage or to give yourself protection from attacks, when used right, each one can leave its mark on the face of battle. Customization Your kills convert into jars of mystery fluid that can be used in the store to buy different skins, rocket trails and even kill emotes for your character. Thrust Yourself to Victory Just wanted an excuse to write this.",
