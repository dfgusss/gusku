Characters are also used in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Macau, China, and Japan. Pronunciation is common to Taiwan and China. No prior language experience is assumed or required. Game Features Puzzle your way through 7 intriguing 3D environments. Learn your first 50 terms directly in context, free of translation. About 2+ hours of gameplay including an overarching storyline. Toggle between traditional or simplified characters. Change to an audio-only mode to practice listening. Browse the included dictionary after each section to validate your understanding. The Philosophy of Language Learning in Sheng Tian (升天) Sheng Tian (升天) was designed by language and learning experts to simulate the experience of being immersed in another culture. Rather than memorizing flashcards or answering forced-choice questions, in Sheng Tian, players intuitively learn words while using them to complete tasks and solve puzzles. As you play, Sheng Tian builds your explicit knowledge, but also unconscious, procedural fluency. Help Us Build The Future of Language Learning If you like this episode, support us! We’d like to continue the story with more Mandarin terms and branch out to other languages with their own unique stories and settings.",
