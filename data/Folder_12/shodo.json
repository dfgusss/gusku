    "About the game": "Note: This game is very much alpha. All features shown in gameplay are currently accessible, and playable. However it is still pretty buggy, so heads up! Shodō is a VR game where players fight in a 5v5 battle of chaos magic, in the martial art of their own design. In this universe you must work for your power . No cheap fireballs, no facerolling, no mana resource to constrain you. The raw power of your Sigil is dependent on both how complex it is, and how accurately you can execute it in the heat of battle. Build your magic art to match your personality - do you like fast paced, rapid attacks that overwhelm your enemy? Opt for flow casting, which minimizes casting time and maximizes attack rate. Or perhaps you would rather forge a weapon no other can destroy, that will instantly kill whatever it touches - at the expense of an intricate, complex sigil. Enter the world of Shodō and experience for yourself, psychic abilities that come at a real mental cost. Become the protagonist, the master of your art, and carve your path into the history of this environment of controlled chaos.",
