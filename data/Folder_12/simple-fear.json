    "About the game": "An entity with tentacles in the house, criminals broke into the house, and both parents dead. That night changed his life course and gave him one goal. Revenge. Today is the day that the revenge plan he has been preparing for his whole life with the entity is going to be fulfilled. The mob leader is having a party and all that is needed is one bullet through his head, pretty simple, right? Well the revenge mission turns out not to be that simple when he starts to learn more about the entity's past, meets a crazy scientist, finds other kids who encountered the entity, fights a giant robot, etc. Weird events start to take place. Very weird ones... Features: - Rich story and lore to be discovered - Multiple weapons hidden throughout the map to be discovered and used to shoot enemies - Choices to determine your ally - Pure silence in-game - Watch your decisions carefully so you don't break the world - Flingerman.",
