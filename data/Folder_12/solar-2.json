    "About the game": "In most games you see stars in the background, you shoot asteroids or you live on planets. But in Solar 2 you ARE these objects! Enter a universe where you must prove yourself to the resident god-like figure by doing its many bizarre and varied tasks. Or just ignore it and see how big you can grow! Solar 2 is an open-world, sandbox game set in an infinite abstract universe. Play constructively: grow your system, nurture life on your planets and attack enemy life in huge space battles. Play destructively: crash into other objects and cause chaos, use your orbiting objects like wrecking balls, steal planets from other systems. Key features: Dynamic abstract sandbox universe. Changes and evolves as you do. Non-linear missions and open-world gameplay. No boundaries. Drift forever in ambient space bliss. Full of weird eccentric humor and stuff. Extensive custom sound track.",
