    "About the game": "The two types of Entities you will encounter in Somni are Ethereals which are Ghost-Like Entities and Cryptids which are Physical Entities Ethereals are not affected by gunfire so it is important to hide when it searches for you and banish it by using the correct ritual for that type of Entity. Cryptids are physical beings that bleed, and the only way to deter one from chasing you is to fight back with superior firepower. Completing a Cryptid ritual will summon the ritual weapon, which is the only firearm capable of ending its life for good. Switching Your Playstyle When up against an Ethereal it is best to hide under beds or in closets to avoid being spotted. These types of Entities are confined to a residence and can corner a player if they aren't perceptive enough. Cryptids are always present in their open environments. Hiding behind containers and firing your weapon only when necessary gives you the best chance to survive. Unique Perks and Abilities Use your earnings from banishing the entity to try out the 11 Abilities available to choose from in the Perk Shop. Each Perk is special and useful for different situations and dependent on the opponent you will be up against! Become Fully Immersed Somni is playable on both a Virtual Reality Headset and on your Desktop with a Mouse and Keyboard or Gamepad with up to 6 Player Online Co-Op and a Server Browser with Proximity Chat that allows players to connect and share their experience Not Only Cryptids Amalgamations are insect-like clusters of bone that roam mostly around Cryptid Environments. They are as fast as the player and can kill just as fast as the Cryptid itself. Keep them at a safe distance and stay out of their sight. Somni's VR experience has been improved in this most recent update. Somni is best experienced by being fully immersed in a virtual reality headset. Experience fear like never before by facing the cryptid and amalgamations with all the odds stacked against you... will you be able to survive?",
