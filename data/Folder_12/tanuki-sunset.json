    "About the game": "Grab Your Longboard and Race to the Top Meet Tanuki , a rad longboarding raccoon from Sunset Island. They may just be a raccoon, but they’re a raccoon with a dream — to land on the cover of FISH , the #1 longboarding magazine in the world! Master the longboard as you drift through stunning mountain ranges, swerve through bustling city streets, and board along the sandy beaches of Sunset Island. Train Tanuki to perform epic tricks, from jumping off ramps to longboarding backwards. Sounds easy, right? Well, it is… if you can do it all while avoiding cars, trucks, and unexpectedly sharp corners. And don’t forget to feed him! Raccoons are hungry trash pandas after all. Collect Tanuki Bits along the way to keep Tanuki fed and to upgrade your gear at Bob's Skate Shop. If Tanuki’s going to be on the cover of FISH, they need some cool threads for the occasion.
