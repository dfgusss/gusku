    "About the game": "Long ago, a powerful witch created a dungeon with a terrifying curse, then retreated into its depths. Any who fall within its dark, stony halls are cursed with undeath. Before long, they become nothing but a mindless, shambling creature. However, the dungeon also brims with treasure, a siren call to adventurers from all over the land. The only way to survive the curse is to rely on Rescuers, a band of 'human recovery agents' charged with plunging into the depths to pull out fallen adventurers. You are one such rescuer, fresh on the job. But soon after your arrival, a curious request comes in. Recover the corpse of a Holy Maiden. The implication is clear. It must be a corpse, and nothing else. When your fellow Rescuer absconds with the advance payment, you're left to keep things running. Will you solve the mystery of the ancient witch? Find the Maiden, then decide her fate? Or will you abandon all sense of duty to indulge in your selfish desires? Only you can decide. Plunge into the depths of Witchhome's dungeon to rescue adventurers from the clutches of undeath while making a fortune in the process! Manage hunger and thirst as you descend. Should you fall, the curse of undeath will begin to take hold. Without the cleansing holy waters of the church, you may find yourself permanently lost. Time is ticking! The fallen in the dungeon cannot survive without your help forever. Take too long, and you may find nothing but shambling zombies awaiting you. A dungeon survival adventure with real-time stakes! Your belly grows empty, and your throat grows dry as you move through the deep. Push too far, and you might find yourself starving to death. Be too cautious, and you might find your potential clients lost to undeath! Real-time combat with a variety of tools! A top-down adventure that requires positioning and clever use of resources. Plant bombs, hurl fire, or just cut enemies down with your sword! Return your spoils to the surface to make a fortune! Puzzling dungeoneering! Dodge traps, light your way, and discover all manner of adventuring tools to help you traverse the treacherous depths of the dungeon!",
