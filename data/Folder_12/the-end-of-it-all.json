    "About the game": "The End of it All is a comedic puzzle/adventure game in which you get to convert a small town to your cult. Players start as The Summoner, a cultist in training. Step one: get to know the townsfolk! Learn their names, relationship dynamics, and interests… and then exploit them for your personal gain. Step two: Use the information you have gathered to efficiently convert new members. Be warned, civilians may go insane, so it’s best to be strategic in your advances. Once a new member is recruited, they become a controllable character. This allows for several unique interactions and paths to victory(hint: some paths are better than others). Have fun, but remember: Teieghged is always watching. Key Features -Interactive puzzles -Unique dialogue options for every character -Ability to control any character -Lovecraftian elements",
