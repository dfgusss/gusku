Art and Aesthetic The Great Deer has a hand drawn cartoon art style, with frame by frame animation. The game uses vector graphics to reach an infinite resolution, so the game will look crystal clear on all devices. The game also utilises a more flat digital art style during some portions to replicate the look of stained glass windows. This too is all vector, so the game looks great on any screen size! UI The Great Deer utilises a simple and clean UI design that both is easy to read, but also reflects the tone of the game. Use left, right, and down arrows on the edges of the screen to move around the temple. Use the inventory on the right of the screen to inspect and use items you find in the temple. Worried your inventory will fill up? Use the little arrow at the bottom to expand the inventory! Gameplay And Puzzles Discovering the secrets of the temple will not be so easy!
