    "About the game": "A world where children aren’t born—they crawl out of tunnels in the ground. A lone city, beneath the gaze of a silent god, home to strange cults who eat the dead. The Pale City is the story of a mercenary hired to find the last, most powerful artifact of a sorcerer who disappeared lifetimes ago. But the search pits him against powerful people in hidden places, towards a secret buried somewhere in terrible darkness. An Unconventional, Character-Driven Narrative: Written and designed by novelist Kyle Muntz, The Pale City tells the story of one man’s struggle against a merciless world and the emptiness inside himself. A Handcrafted, Semi-Open World: Every room has a purpose; every battle has meaning; every step you take tells you more about yourself. The Price of Survival: Tense, unforgiving combat that rewards close observation and careful use of skills, where defense is often more important than offense. Multiple Difficulty Levels: Brave normal mode to experience the brutal reality of life in a harsh world, or story mode if you'd rather focus on the game's storytelling, exploration, and lore. A Solitary Journey: In a city without heroes, can you bear to see the consequences of your actions?",
