Here is your chance to be The Turdler you always knew you could be in this crude VR title that throws you the reins of mass destruction. Destroy each room with gusto as you hurl toys and other household goodies at your parents favorite knick-knacks and trinkets, watching them explode to your delight. If that's not satisfactory, drop some dookies on the ground and fling them around like the naughty little rascal I know you can be.",
