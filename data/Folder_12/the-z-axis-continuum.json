You manipulate time and space at will, but do you have the mind to solve the warped reality that imprisons you? Play the 2D puzzle platformer game inspired by Portal which started off as a popular little jam entry and has since blossomed into the 30 level reality-defying monstrosity that it has become. All levels are carefully handcrafted (not randomly generated) to challenge even the most seasoned puzzle platformer fan's understanding of physics, time, and space. No one escapes the Continuum unscathed. 2D Puzzle platformer Dark pixel art style with an ambient horror soundtrack 30 Handcrafted levels (no procedural generation) Includes 6 tutorial levels and 9 'extra hard' remix levels at the end for a formidable challenge Rotate the environment to change gravity Portals Clones Character death becomes a puzzle element Time manipulation 34 Individual achievements to gather Includes a slew of timed achievements for speedrunners",
