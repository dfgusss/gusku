    "About the game": "The universe renews, refreshes and repeats, infinitely folding in on itself. I am made of its energy. My past and future selves are always with me. We work together to generate the infinite cycle of creation and destruction. I exist within and without time, I am inevitable, I am eternal. Time and gravity are my tools to manipulate the world. I don't recognize this world, but I know I have been here before. Transpose is a dreamlike VR puzzle game set in a universe where time and gravity are used as tools to manipulate the world. By creating and working with looped recordings of their actions, players must solve increasingly complex physics puzzles in a mysterious setting where notions of space and time no longer apply. Player Echoes Transpose features real time player recording, allowing you to play back your actions one to one in real time while interacting with your past selves. You must create echoes of your self, rewind time, and work with these echoes to solve puzzles. Go ahead, give yourself a high five. Time and Gravity Set in a mesmerizingly surreal world, Transpose allows players to control time and gravity. Rotate the environment around you to walk on walls and ceilings, experience perspective shifts and multifaceted puzzles in ways only possible in VR. Worlds Travel across 3 distinct worlds solving gravity defying physics puzzles in over 35 unique levels featuring impossible, otherworldly architecture. Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
