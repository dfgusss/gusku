    "About the game": "When Maple introduced her college roommate to her older brother, she didn't expect them to get married. She REALLY didn't expect them to blow their life savings on a castle, either. So, she decided it was her responsibility to talk some sense into the two. This backfires on her, BADLY, when she inexplicably gives them the idea to start their own tiny island nation. Now, coming on bad times and having no other options, Maple decides to pack up, drop out of school, and move onto the island. Little does she know however what the next few months have in store for the three Tremblays. Set in the urban fantasy world of E. Howard Hill's novel 'Vous Voilà', Tremblay Island is a part digital comic, part open-world game, part mystery. Take on the role of any island villager and interact with the others, taking part in the drama while eventually trying to keep a grouchy alligator from taking over the island. Features: - play as up to eight characters - explore hidden secrets and hidden minigames - unlock all minigame keys for a surprise at the end - engage with relatively light drama between characters - confront an alligator about his stupid frog drawing",
