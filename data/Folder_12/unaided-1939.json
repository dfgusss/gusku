    "About the game": "Unaided: 1939 is a hardcore Top-Down shooter with stealth elements, set in the year 1939 before the start of World War II. Germany has not yet attacked Poland but tensions have already risen in central Europe. You play as Vita Banks, a British spy who infiltrated Nazi Germany a year before the outbreak of the war. Cut off from her agency and contacts, you alone must do your part in weakening the Nazis and stopping this war before it even begins. A challenging game – your wits and reactions will be tested. Bullets are deadly and your enemies don't think twice in firing. Your game, your style – you can go in guns blazing, throwing grenades, and shooting vehicles until they explode. However, you can also take a more stealthy approach, taking down guards from behind, or sneaking past patrols. You choose how you approach each mission. Interesting storyline and characters – witness Germany in all its glory just before the outbreak of World War II. Play the role of Vita Banks as she encounters impossible odds and daring missions all alone. Awesome weapons – realistic weapons and items ranging from the classic HDM Silenced pistol to the tank destroyer Panzerfuast! All this will surely immerse you in the world.",
