    "About the game": "'It's super... super... super addicting.' - Virtual Reality Ginger 'A very nice retro kind of 1980s arcade game, re-imagined in Virtual Reality. I absolutely love it.' - VRSpies This new version offers an exclusive game mode made specifically for the Vive controllers. Vektron Revenge is an old school style shooter done exclusively for VR. The playfield has no limits as you will be avoiding and destroying waves of geometric enemies in a 360 environment. But beware of 3D obstacles that come in your way and use the devastating shooting spray of the Revenge power up wisely to clean up the levels from the toughest baddies. The fastest you clean a wave the bigger the wave bonus. Concentrate on grabbing the blue pills coming from enemies to score extra but don’t be to greedy or you might end up trapped in a difficult position. Steam Leaderboards: Reach the top 10 for world fame! Try to be the best as you climb the ranks through the world leaderboards. May your name be among the coveted top 10 of the Vektron hall of fame!",
