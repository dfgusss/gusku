Alone, and free to discover the works in the most emblematic rooms, immerse yourself fully in the Palace of Versailles. The King and Queen’s State Apartments are all yours, plus other locations besides... Climb onto the stage in the Royal Opera House, draw up close to the high altar in the Royal Chapel sculpted by Corneil Van Clève in the 18th century, and discover the Hall of Mirrors, one of the most iconic places. Tapestries, paintings, ceilings, sculptures and furniture, everything is within reach of your controller to grant you unlimited and privileged access to the treasures of Versailles. For a more intimate experience, switch to night mode and explore the Palace by the light of chimney fires. Happy exploring! Realized in collaboration with Google Arts &amp; Culture.",
