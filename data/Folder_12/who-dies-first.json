    "About the game": "The goal of this 2D RPG is not to kill dragons, but to use the skills and buffs provided by the game to control 'which skills are used' and 'who dies first' to obtain different game endings. Four characters , and seven skill combinations, there will be a total of 4 x 7 = 28 different endings. There are also 5 hidden achievements, a total of 33 plots waiting for players to explore. Some of the plots are related to each other and some are not. Except for the three pure funny ones, most of others contain a theme: 'the law of the jungle'. The law of the jungle used to be the survival rule of mankind for a long time. Now most of us live under the rule of law. Although it seems that there are some 'cruel' struggles, such as 'death penalty' and even 'detention for 15 days', these are also 'death penalty' and 'detention for 15 days' under the law framework. No one is willing to return to the law of the jungle and judge right or wrong only by fist and gun. Although the theme of the game is 'the law of the jungle', this has never been a value that I advocate, but my description of the old human society - I have to write this clearly here. Almost all the game assets come from the official free asset package 'Dragon Crashers' on assetstore of Unity. 'All content can be added to your own creative projects,' the website said. I also wrote an email to Unity to ask if I can use this asset for commercial use, and got a positive reply from Unity. Someones told me that using this set of resources will be scolded by players or other developers. I think using authorized free resources should not be malicious by others.So I use it. I would like to thank Unity and the original authors of these resources. In my first two works: 'Human Origin' tells a story of a zombie man who helps alien humans invade the earth; In the 'Human Origin: Liu Lanzhi', although the protagonist is 'Liu Lanzhi', one branch introduces the alien human leaders who invading the earth are PanGu and NvWa, and further introduces how the zombie man became a helmet knight and be cursed into the final boss. In 'who dies first', there are five plots related to the story line of 'Human Origin', which introduce how PanGu and NvWa came to the earth from aliens planet : PanGu and NvWa were original human and their prisoners. They were used for biochemical experiments. A student of original human scientists observed that through a variation they could breathe oxygen. He thought that as long as they were placed on an oxygen rich planet, they could survive as 'another possibility of human beings'......",
