The world is in chaos after a prototype combat robot - banned by law and awaiting secure destruction by XERA Corporation - became self-aware, escaped and began replication on an industrial scale. Failed attempts to remotely shut down the AI simply triggered a war that humanity could not afford to lose. Nation turned on nation in a fight for control over resources to defend against the robots. With the attention of the world’s military elsewhere, disenfranchised operatives have gathered to ransack what was left of the XERA facilities, setting up two forward operating bases, Safe Zones on each side of the forest that was the hiding place for mankind’s greatest failure of leadership. Between these bases there are no rules of engagement. The only imperative is survival. XERA: Survival is developed by Spotted Kiwi Interactive, an independent development company based in the deep south of New Zealand (Aotearoa) with team members around the world: 4 in NZ, 1 in Chile, 1 in Russia and 1 in USA.",
