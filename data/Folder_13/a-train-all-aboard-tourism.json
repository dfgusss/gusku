    "About the game": "Become the president of a railroad company! A-Train: All Aboard! Tourism is a business simulation game in which you use the railroad to help towns develop. In the world of A-Train, people gather around stations, gradually developing the surrounding town. As president of your very own railroad company, you are free to build stations and lay train lines as you see fit. What kind of railroad will you create? How will you develop the town? All these choices and more are yours to make. However, as company president, your job is about more than just developing the transportation network. It's important that you decorate your town by establishing subsidiaries and advertise your company to increase your brand power. Tourism-based urban planning In each town, you will find a variety of tourist attractions, from idyllic hot spring districts to ancient historical castles. There are many tourists who would love to visit these locations at least once. However, whether these locations ever reach their full potential depends entirely on your skill. If a destination is difficult to reach, it will receive few visitors, regardless of how stunning its sights may be. Use the railroad, bus lines, and even ferries to envision and enable enjoyable holidays. Your success will surely be reflected in the number of tourists flocking to your town. All aboard! Tourism is a one-way ticket to urban planning! Any town you can envision is yours to create! Do you want to see a highly developed metropolis? Perhaps a quiet town, tucked away in the shadow of its beautiful tourist attractions? How about a bustling city with a highly efficient transportation network? You decide the town's future. This story is yours, told with the help of your friends and associates. Now, it's time to get started on tourism planning and begin working towards your ideal city!",
