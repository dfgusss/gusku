    "About the game": "ACROSS is a roomscale VR game, where you are tasked with a simple objective : cross the room. Each level has a start portal, an end portal, ... and things in between. You can count on two things to help you defeat each level : a glowing katana that cuts through everything and reflect projectiles, and a furry B.E.A.R. that you must protect at all costs. 25 levels - about 1 hour of playtime. Change the color of your weapon at will. Not a wave shooter : ACROSS makes you think and observe before acting (well, except for that one level). Roomscale VR : Makes full use of the HTC vive capabilities. ACROSS is played standing, and without pressing any button.",
