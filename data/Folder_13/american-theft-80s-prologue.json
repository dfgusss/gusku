KEY FEATURES IN THE PROLOGUE: - explore the first small town from the American Theft 80s - steal from houses, trailers or gas stations - finish the first heist - use the available tools: hammer and crowbar, to break in - finish shady jobs for shady characters - disguise yourself as an electrician to fool tenants If you see a house, shop or a gas station, you can get inside, but learn about the tenants first. You don't want to get caught. Remember VHS, cassette players, and CRT TVs? No? Well, now you can get to know them! The tenants will surely share them with you, albeit not knowingly. Earn cash and reputation in the underground world filled with corruption and crime. Sometimes the only thing you can do is get in the car and drive as fast as possible. But be careful! The cops are not playing around and will chase after you. Make sure to bribe the police to avoid being wanted.",
