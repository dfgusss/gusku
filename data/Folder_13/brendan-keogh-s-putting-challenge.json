    "About the game": "Brendan Keogh’s Putting Challenge is a relaxing open-world golf game about all the parts other golf videogames cut out. Sounds tedious? It sort of is. With up to four players on a single device (or online by using Remote Play), you have complete freedom to explore the massive open-world at your own pace with your friends. Play a round of mini-golf, compete on a full 9 hole course, go for a bike ride or just see who can hit the ball the furthest at the driving range. It’s entirely up to you. Originally developed in Pico-8, this labour of love has been painstakingly rebuilt and expanded on to include a larger world and more features, while retaining the original 8-bit retro charm. Features: Massive open-world to explore Five 9-hole courses including; mini-golf, an extra-large desert course, and secret holes hidden throughout the world Up to four players local (or online by using Remote Play) Full controller support Two players are able to play using a single keyboard Save your progress for later Original soundtrack by Dan Golding (Untitled Goose Game, Frog Detective) 22 Achievements Brendan Keogh's Putting Challenge: Luxury Golf Cart Walking to each hole feeling a bit tedious? Good, it's meant to. But! Why not travel in style with your very own 4-seater luxury golf cart! Ride around with 3 of your other friends, or not. It's your cart so do what you want with it. (except drive it outside of the golf courses, which is strictly prohibited)",
