    "About the game": "You made it out of the TransCorp office alive, only to discover that more than menial office tasks have been taken over by robots. Is humanity being optimized out of existence altogether? Something needs to be done. Built from the ground-up for Virtual Reality , Budget Cuts is an action-adventure stealth game where you take down the evil robots at TransCorp. Prepare to zip across high-speed trains , stealth your way through the TransCorp skyscrapers , sneak across warehouses, rooftop buildings, fabrication plants, server halls, and more! The newly added Mutators Patch provides a range of locomotion options (including the smooth kind!), along with enemy modifiers , slow motion , and new weapon choices . Read the full list of modifiers and patch notes here ! In Budget Cuts 2 you have tons of shiny tools to help you take down TransCorp . Use the Magnifying Glass to track enemy positions and sneak past them , or take enemies down from a distance with the Bow and Arrow. Throw knives at the Supervisors to deplete their 'oil', or knock enemies out with blunt objects. How you approach each combat situation is entirely up to you , your imagination, and the number of knives you can hold in your hands (well, that, and your inventory slots).",
