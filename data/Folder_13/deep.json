Just a quick little indie game made for class :) Features (Potential Spoilers): - Three different stages of the game - Different goals and mechanics for each stage - Fetch Quests and 'stealth' section - Exploration and discovery - Unique 'Translation' mechanic (translate runes flying at you to keyboard letters, and press them all in time to keep Fido at bay) - Roughly 15-30min playtime - A main menu",
