    "About the game": "Down n' Up is a platformer where you take control of a weird creature that is only capable of one action: jumping . ...as a gamer, that's something you're good at, right? REACHING THE TOP WON'T BE AN EASY TASK A unique gameplay: fully control the angle and velocity of your jump with the mouse cursor or gamepad stick You are able to stick to any platform, but be careful: you will peel off after a few seconds New game mechanics for each zone: blocks in rhythm, moving platforms, portals, and more to discover along the way The whole game is contained in one giant map, so you better not fall from too high MANY OTHER CHALLENGES AWAIT YOU Find and collect all 20 stars of the game: some of them are well hidden, and others are very hard to catch Race to the top with the developer's ghost (that's me), or with the ghost of your previous run You can even race with your friend's ghost Climb higher and higher and remember: be careful not to fall.",
