    "About the game": "Dungeoneer is a dungeon-crawler action RPG with an old school feel and style where you progress by completing dungeons, leveling up, increasing your skills, earning experience, and learning new abilities. Choose from 6 classes and 5 skills to start your Hero. From there, you can customize your build by learning abilities from spell books purchased from vendors or found throughout dungeons. Utilize your skills to interact with the environment in unique ways, craft items, and synergize with your party. Play solo or with up to 4 players. Complete quests for additional rewards and lore. Find randomly generated loot from barrels, chests, and enemies or farm for that specific item from a boss. Beware, traps and hazards which could crush or impale you lie around every corner! Test your build and strength against other players by joining the arena for PvP.",
