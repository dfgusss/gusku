    "About the game": "You play as a lone wanderer. Captured, robbed, and cast into the Abyss, you are left for dead. But below is a dungeon crafted to test the very limits of your wits and bravery. The warnings tell you to turn back, but that way is closed now. Besides, you were never one to shirk from a challenge! Dungeons of Legend: Cast Within is a first person grid based dungeon crawling adventure. Each level of this dungeon is hand crafted to provide the most immersive and complete experience. Explore, search, gather hints, solve riddles, fight monsters, and find tons of loot and upgrades! Game Features: Exploration: Each level is full of secrets and divergent paths, some more dangerous than others. A keen eye and attention to detail yields great rewards. Puzzles, Riddles and mysteries: Your wits and logic will be tested by unique (and perhaps a little twisted at times) puzzles and riddles. Monsters: Dozens of creatures and opponents have gathered below, and something strange oversees them. Loot: The right equipment and items make all the difference for the various classes available. Beautiful Polygon graphics that are a joy to behold.",
