    "About the game": "You looking for hell? Congratulations, you found it! What do you mean, impossible? Ok, let's explain... A colourful hell. Elliot is a colourful 2D platformer inspired in 16-bit classics yet with a hardcore touch. Don't be fooled by appearances, it's a tough game! Run, jump and dash through over 60+ levels to solve the mystery surrounding the World of Elliot, Manuel and the adorable Mombas. Need to know more? Elliot, that loveable little blue ball, is a Momba, a wild, free, musical creature who lives alone in the natural world. Well, not entirely alone: with his friend, Manuel. But one apparently ordinary day, strange things begin to happen. How to play? It's easy: run, jump and dash in any direction. Die, come straight back and die again. What will you find? Two loveable characters, Elliot and Manuel. Collectibles to help you discover the story of Elliot's World. You yourself, making titanic efforts to get through the 60-plus levels in 11 chapters. Stress, frustration and possibly rage. but don't worry, the soundtrack will make everything much easier. Speedrun mode, if you want to break personal records or challenge your friends. Achievements, in case the ordinary game itself leaves you in need of more. Love letter to platformers: Elliot is our lil' love letter to the genre. If you dig platforms and challenges, we promise you're gonna love this experience.",
