Tempered by an abundance of slapstick humor, monstrous enemies and bosses, and lovable characters, End of the Mine is sure to offer a one of a kind experience. You are a miner on a distant planet excavating valuable resources. After a night of relaxing with your fellow miners, you awake to find them gone and the colony you call home deserted. With only your faithful companion Camm-E to help, you must venture into the mines of this now deserted planet in search of your friends -- and answers. But even as you look down into the darkness of the mine, you can't help but wonder -- do you have what it takes to reach the End of the Mine? Features Enter the Miner: You are The Miner, a man on a mission to find his friends and the truth. Run, dash, jump, and hover your way through the planet using a keyboard/mouse or a controller.
