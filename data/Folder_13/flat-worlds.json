    "About the game": "Flat Worlds is a VR space transport game set in our very own Solar System. Setup transport networks of people and natural resources, guiding the path of human colonization around the Solar System's planets and moons. What will we find when there is no more room to grow? Eight Worlds - 4 solid planets, and the moons of the remaining gas planets. Many different ships, large and small, each named and stylized according to their home. Multiple resource types, including people, water, energy, metal, and crystals. Multiple buildings, mainly spaceports, with different numbers of docks and dock sizes (large ships need large docks). World progression system - worlds level up, leading to more suppliers, cities and further colonization. World perk system - each world has six unique perks available to aid you. End Game - the last two worlds hold the secrets to the end. The game is highly playable in its current form, however: Only six worlds are playable (out of eight). No large ships exist yet. No end game is implemented yet (although planned).",
