    "About the game": "Fleshcult is a text-based RPG where you play a sex demon: an incubus or succubus. You lurk on the margins of an unsuspecting city, seducing mortals into your underground lair. You're a shape-shifter, transforming your body and the bodies of your minions. You pick the kinks: As you play the game, you opt into the fetishes that you want to see. Play whichever gender you want , and play with the genders you want (including transgender characters). Meet goths, pornstars, house-husbands, nurses, bodybuilders, and more. Find temptations that they cannot resist. It's text based, but it's not a visual novel. You're continually involved, making decisions. Corrupt your body with over 65 different transformations, body mods, and clothing items. Build your lair. Snare intruders in a variety of traps. Fleshcult for Steam is a revival of the 2014 web game with new content, including a new fourth location and new transformation tomes, such as the Tome of Infestation. Now with Steam Workshop support!",
