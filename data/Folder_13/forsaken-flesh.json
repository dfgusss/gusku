    "About the game": "Forsaken Flesh is an unforgiving hardcore platformer game. Defeat souls with powerful bodies in search of 'keys' hidden all over the world to deal with increasingly powerful enemies, from abandoned tombs to royal palaces with kings. Playable characters Dragon Slayer is a powerful knight with the highest basic stamina, a wide range of basic attacks and a deadly blow that strikes a straight sword. Extensive basic attacks make it easy to defeat enemies in the air. Dragon Slayer can use the 'Dragon's Tears' item that can restore all stamina at every stage. Great Thief is a sleek thief with normal basic stamina, basic attacks going straight, and a special attack wielding a wide range of swords ahead. With a wide range of special moves, you can easily defeat many enemies that are difficult to kill. Kung Fu Master is a powerful martial artist that has the lowest basic stamina, the shortest basic attack range, but doubles the basic attack of other characters, and a special attack that emits energy waves of powerful damage spreading in all directions.",
