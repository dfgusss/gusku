    "About the game": "Furgal's Jetpack is a 2D runner with a side view. You are unjustly imprisoned, and your goal is to escape from the clutches of evil captors who foolishly tied you up not enough and left you near ... JETPACK! Fly over cars and Dodge flying clubs to get to the desired freedom, because the only way to it is through the thorns of the urban jungle. If you haven't laughed heartily for a long time, you don't have enough dynamic chases and you miss the absurdity and madness, Furgal's Jetpack is the solution to all these problems, because only here you can fly a jetpack in the Russian hinterland, running away from the evil Momon-corp and their dangerous flying clubs!",
