    "About the game": "We've all heard the stories of that crusading crustacean whom journeyed to the other side of the universe to find the true reason of his existence. Now you can experience the adventure in 180 degree full-motion audio! Alas, it is time to adorn your beautiful evening gown (+ increased health regeneration) and join us in this plucky adventure. Use a plethora of musical instruments at your disposal to defeat hastily photoshopped characters on a grid of 49 (7x7) different levels. Featuring 180 BPM musical contributions from Your Infamous Harp alongside Caerus, Emancipator, Mysz, the Dead Method. If multiple introductory paragraphs are not good enough on their own to persuade you to play, keep reading. The music in this game is constantly shifting and evolving and is pleasant to the ears. If there's anything at all to take away from this game, it is that crazy wild music which everyone just loves!",
