    "About the game": "Hobo Living VR is a game that puts the player into the shoes of a homeless person living on a city street block. You will need to make money any way you can to purchase the essentials for street living. The daytime is good for begging for change, busking or doing odd jobs. Upon initial EA release you will be able to beg for change, but busking and odd jobs will be added soon after. At night, the hobos must sleep, but depending on how the day has gone you may not be able to sleep without the aid of drugs or alcohol. Money can be used to purchase these items from the corner store. Stealing is also an option, but be careful, or you could end up in jail for the night. Bodily functions must be managed as well. Wait too long and you may make a smelly mess, which might get you in trouble. Keeping healthy is important, but because sleep is a must you may need to do some unhealthy things to make that happen. Alcohol and sleeping pills may help, but they can degrade your health. Eventually, you will be able to gather enough money to rent the apartment located above the local store and get off the street for good.",
