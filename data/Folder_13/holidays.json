    "About the game": "In this RPG, you awake to find a dog on your bed. You then go on an adventure to try and bring it back home and save your town from the monster in the forest! Features: - An original story where you won’t know where it’s going! I made the basis for this story and it’s worlds on two pieces of papers while in class over 9 years ago! - Created by one person except for the music! - Original art and music within. - Funny jokes and stuff. I’m sure it’ll make you laugh at least once! - On screen encounters. - Hug your way to victory! You need to know! This is also a short game that should take approx 3 hours to finish. Take it as a one off game as it will be a while before I get back to making the other parts. Take this game as a piece of art that you can enjoy and experience and most importantly, have fun!",
