    "About the game": "A priceless painting has been stolen, and the only ones who can find it are Huckleberry Fields and his friends. Huckleberry Fields Forever is a platformer mystery mashup : think platformers ( Super Mario World , Sonic The Hedgehog , etc.) mixed with mystery exploration games ( Where In The World Is Carmen Sandiego ), all procedurally generated. Chase thieves around the globe. 50+ real-world locations. Hundreds of levels. Interview witnesses. Gather clues. Eliminate suspects. Awesome co-op platforming action. Mystery platformer : Classic 2D platforming action mixed with mystery and exploration. Was the thief bald? Did he wear glasses? He went boating on the Spree--where's that? (If your geography is rusty, don't worry, press pause and check the handy in-game reference.) Travel the world : Catch a flight to anywhere on the globe open-world-style and visit hundreds of levels across over 50 real-world locations. Procedurally generated : Each case is procedurally generated from meticulously handcrafted components, including the overworld maps, levels, and even the suspects. Exploration : Secret exits, hidden rooms, invisible blocks, special items. Keep your eyes open because there's a lot to find and discover in each and every level. Hidden in each level are witnesses and clues . Find them to figure out what the thief looks like and where they went . Or get distracted earning coins to spend in shops, riding motorcycles, completing outdoor patches (sidequests), or even get a job. But don't dally too long. Huckleberry and friends have only 72 hours—about an hour in real time—to solve each case, which is perfect for a single play session. Play for an hour and actually accomplish something. Or binge your way through the whole multi-case story arc. That's cool too. Randomly generated cases and procedurally generated levels means no two cases will be the same. New suspects, new world maps, and new levels every case. The world is packed with 100+ unique items to discover and collect over the course of your adventure. Upgradeable weapons , equippable shoes that provide new abilities , permanent skill upgrades , and even new characters and outfits are scattered throughout the world for you to find and play with. Solve the case alone or with friends. Grab three of your closest buddies and work together to track down the thief. Or just hit each other with hammers and baseball bats in a frantic race to the level exit. Either way. It mostly depends on what kind of friends you have.",
