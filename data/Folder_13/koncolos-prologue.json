    "About the game": "Shift of Aras, who works as a bartender in a small pub where everyone knows each other, ends at 20:00. But for the last couple of days, the whole place turns upside down right after that time. In regards to the things told, it is not a simple drunken brawl. Because the woman who starts the fight every night asks a question before all the quarrel: 'Do you know a monster that dwells around here?' Getting curious on this question, Aras tries to find ways to learn more about this woman. As his mundane and repetitive days are left behind, will Aras be able to preserve his tenuous psyche from the chaos ahead? Text-based story rich gaming experience Interaction with hand drawn comic book assets Anime style characters Original ambient soundtrack In the first episode of this Visual Novel, explore the hidden aspects of a living left ages behind, where ordinary folk, mages and monsters live together. Aras held most characteristic of the capital in which he lived with 5 millions other inhabitants in the center of Anatolia. Neither of them had any particular features one could think of right away. Everyone knew their names but nobody really cared about them. They both had a vision of sorts at one time, but they seemed to abandon it. Even the unfavorable aspects of cities, and of humans, can express a great deal, however this was not one of those cases. Being exposed to their bleak aura wasn't like choking in a depressive spiritual trench, but evoked the feeling of drowning in a muddy puddle along the sidewalk. They were not tedious, but also not lively. If you'd ask them how they'd have been, they would answer with 'living somehow'.",
