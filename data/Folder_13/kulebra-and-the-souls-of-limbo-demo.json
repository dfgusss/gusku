    "About the game": "Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo is a 3D adventure game where you’ll meet the many good and not-so-good folks of Limbo, a place where souls with deep regrets are cursed into repeating the same day on a loop. Use your wits and keen eye to gather clues from the residents and find items that will help you to breach the obstacles in your path one by one. You play as Kulebra, a dead snake with a heart of gold that wakes up in Limbo. With his only lead being the words of a strange Old Lady, he embarks on a quest to find his purpose while sharing his light with the residents in hopes of helping them as well. This demo contains a 1.5 to 2 hour-long adventure for you to have fun with and get a taste of what this game is about! This story will be continued in the full release.
