The online competitive mode is fast paced and challenging. The single player campaign is relaxed and requires ingenious thinking. Features include: Free to play. NOT pay-to-win. Skills based with no RNG. Competitive ranked online multiplayer mode. Challenging puzzles in campaign mode. 7 unlockable tokens. 4 different background scenarios. 11 board styles. Original music soundtracks. Virtual Reality (Windows only). !Explosions!",
