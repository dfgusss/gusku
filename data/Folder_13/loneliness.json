    "Name": "Loneliness",
    "Release date": "Mar 1, 2021",
    "About the game": "An experimental, minimalistic art game that explores a single emotion and takes only a few minutes to play through. Loneliness is a simple top-down exploration game where the only available input is movement. Explore a flat landscape populated by other squares that engage in various social behaviors represented metaphorically through patterns of their own simple movement. Loneliness was originally released as a Flash game in 2010. It was featured prominently by Extra Credits (Season 4, Episode 3: Mechanics as Metaphor) and others, and received a variety of accolades, including being nominated for the Extra Credits Innovation Awards. Other people said the game was the worst thing they'd ever played--but at least it wasn't on Steam. This is a 10th anniversary release that is true to the original game, except that the end screen has been notably removed, as described at the game's home page.
