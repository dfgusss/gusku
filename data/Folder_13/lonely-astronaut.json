    "About the game": "Lonely Astronaut is a one-button arcade game in which you pilot the corpse of a long-abandoned astronaut floating in a cosmic graveyard. In the process, you might find out something about the human condition. But probably not. Features: Pilot a Corpse with a Single Button: With only the ability to thrust the Astronaut's body around with its malfunctioning jetpack, Lonely Astronaut is easy to pick up and play weep. Discover Cosmic Truths: The wonders of space will reveal themselves to you as you play. If only you were alive to see these truths unfold. Unlock Skulls: Play dress-up with your corpse because that's healthy, and discover their unique properties. Feel Existential Dread: Here's a friendly reminder that you and I are all going to die someday, probably sooner than we'd like to think.",
