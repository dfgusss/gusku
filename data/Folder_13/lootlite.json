    "About the game": "Dragons steal everything they come across... That’s something the new inhabitants of this peculiar peninsula discover when they arrive. You must help all these unfortunate heroes to recover all that stolen treasure... LootLite is a roguelike-arcade in which you can embody different heroes to try to recover their stolen treasures, through a huge area full of secrets, hidden paths and all kinds of weapons that will make your playthrough easier. All levels are automatically generated, making each game unique and unrepeatable. Travel through every corner of the peninsula in search of weapons and runes, as well as secret paths and alternative routes. Travel through the land, from ancient dungeons to the bowels of an old volcano, slaying any enemy you come across along the way. LootLite is a top-down pixel art game that is easy to understand at first but may become a challenge for those who want to master the game 100%. You control seven types of classes: Warrior, mage, assassin, apothecary, barbarian, necromancer and the dreaded dragon knight. Each class has unique skills, so that each type of player can play the way they like best. You can try to beat the highscores in global and weekly leaderboards. Prove that you are able to recover the stolen treasure, try to generate loops to advance beyond 100% and climb to the top of the rankings. Don’t want to play alone? Then connect a gamepad and give it to a friend to play in local cooperative mode.",
