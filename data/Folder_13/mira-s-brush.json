Capture colour and shape! Mira's Brush is a cute, colour-based puzzle platformer brimming with bizarre enemies, lateral thinking puzzles, and intriguing gameplay experiments. ❔Who is Mira?? Mira is an ordinary school-aged girl doing a dozen odd-jobs, from electrical engineering to the occasional crocodile wrestle. As a house painter, Mira uses her magic brush to steal colour from a host of enemies, and use those colours to jump, dash, and figure her way through Chromaland. 🌈Fun Bosses! 📖Story Mira is up against a little evil, of course. Colonel Blump and his cohort of artistic villains have stolen the colour from RainbowCastle, and Empress Kitty needs your help. Well, I mean, if she could speak, she'd totally ask for your help. Frankly, she kinda sits there. Mira has been tasked with restoring colour to Chromaland across all 8 art-style based worlds, returning the 8 colour crystals, and squaring off against the villainous Blump. I mean, what does he want a bunch of rainbows for anyway? He's such a sour sea-lion. 🎈Collect Power-Ups! When Mira defeats an enemy, she can also steal it's 'shape' in the form of magic stencils. These stencils transform Mira's brush into a wide-range of unique powerups, from shooting stars to balloons, to mirror-Miras, fresh fruit and more.",
