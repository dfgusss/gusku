    "About the game": "The year 2060 and the earth's ecosphere is on the brink of collapsing. A group of scientists and ecologists named 'Clepsydra' have gathered from all over the world to salvage the remains, looking for answers to the global crisis by experimenting on small terrariums, with the aim of shedding light on how to fix the global ecosphere. You play as a synthetic water drop that is set loose to help the scientists complete nature's habit, as every living thing is dependent on water. Expect to face many challenging tasks, traverse set types of terrains surfaces (natural and man-made) and overcome other natural effects and effectors such as crippling concentrated sun rays, windy zones, and synthetic ants. By completing those set challenges, you will help 'Clepsydra' to develop the next generation of synthetic self-aware water, where it will go to pre-determined objective locations and aid dying and dehydrated plants, or put out small fires. Be aware that you are not their first trial. Many generations of synthetic water drops were deployed and tested, but unfortunately, none survived, luckily you can carry their memories and their learned from their mistakes. KEY FEATURES A cinematic relaxing journey, ' Nature's Habit ' will let you see the world through the eyes of a tiny waterdrop and move through a lovely set of miniature words. Each level will contain slightly different features, the calmness of the music and the interesting visuals will make the level memorable: To stay alive you have to: -Move Jump - Shoot - Dodge But be warned! Some levels might include surviving-fight moments with your enemy, the synthetic ants. Side note, to create a relaxing-interesting journey the length of the game is shortened to around one hour .",
