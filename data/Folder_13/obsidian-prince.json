    "About the game": "Obsidian Prince is quirky tactical, turn-based game that mixes deck-building with deep tactical combat. Challenge yourself in the roguelike mode or explore the campaign, complete quests, unlock new areas and build &amp; expand your base while pushing back against the threat of the Obsidian Prince. KEY FEATURES VISIT UNIQUE, RANDOMIZED DUNGEONS No play-through will ever be the same. Each dungeon is procedurally generated from handcrafted rooms. Delve into the purple dungeon, conquer the cursed fortress, brave the bandit forest or take on one of the many other unique dungeons and locations in the Obsidian Prince. TACTICAL COMBAT WHERE EVERY MOVE MATTERS Prepare to always think one step ahead of the enemy. As you delve into the dungeons, the difficulty and complexity of each battle will increase. Make sure you’ve accounted for all the different moves and abilities of your foes or risk sending another hero to the grave. RECRUIT THE HERO YOU WANT Each class has it's own set of unique abilities and starting weapons. Choose between the melee focused warrior who charges and stuns or the kiting ranger using their crow as dot damage. Maybe you'd rather set the world on fire with the Candlemage, spread mold to box in enemies with the Mold Druid or sneak up on people to stab them in the back with the very red Rouge? Choose between 9 distinct classes each with their own backstory that develops as you play and reflects the feats you accomplish. SHAPE THE LIFE OF YOUR HERO Recruit young hopeful adventurers each with unique potentials and challenges based on their childhood. Decide their training and watch how it impacts their abilities. Continue forging their lifestories through adventures. Every adventure will change your hero and how you play it. EXPLORE AND EXPAND YOUR WAY Discover dozens of handcrafted areas and add them to your kingdom through unique events where you pick the approach. Find new allies, uncover hidden dungeons and help the inhabitants of Emalon by solving their quests. BUILD YOUR LEGACY Loot resources, find or unlock building schematics to build a base that provides bonuses, shopping opportunities or unlocks new classes. The better your base, the easier future heroes will have it. ARM YOURSELF TO THE TEETH Loot, buy or earn powerful new weapons. Each hero comes with 2 starter weapons, but no hero is locked in their weapon choice. Want a ranger with sword and bow, fine! Have you always dreamed of a warrior using traps and a magic staff? Go for it. Discover powerful new weapon combinations and play your heroes your way! With 17 unique weapons and a ton of powerful artifacts you can create a myriad of creative builds. GET INSPIRED EVERY TURN Build a deck of inspirations that buff or alter your abilities. Every turn draw three inspirations from your deck and trigger them by using corresponding abilities. Each level you can pick a new inspiration. Choose wisely, you don’t want to clog up your deck! TWO DISTINCT GAME MODES Choose between Roguelike Mode or Campaign Mode. BACKSTORY By cheating death the Obsidian Prince has fragmented the fabric between dimensions. Unimaginable horrors are now pushing through from other planes threatening to destroy the world of Emalon. Can you send the Obsidian Prince back to the underworld and repair the damage he’s inflicted on the idyllic fantasy world?
