    "About the game": "Oversight blends turn-based strategy with gripping espionage gameplay. Compete against another player to create a network of agents to pass along assets to designated sectors. But beware: agents are only loyal to the highest bidder. Ensure your defenses by keeping agents loyal and paid. Infiltrate the opponent by bribing their agents to report their actions — and have them disrupt those actions at opportune moments. Expose enemy efforts to compromise your network through surveillance and well placed traps. Vary your tactics to control the board while completing your objectives. Be careful who you trust and may the best spymaster win. Features: Head-to-head PVP Simultaneous turns during online play Gameplay based around hidden information Create a spy network by recruiting agents and establish connections between the director and sector contacts. Compete against the enemy network to secure all the assets for the round to its assigned sector. Bribe the opponent’s agents to shift their loyalty in your favor. Loyal agents report to you, revealing your opponent’s activities. Activate your double agents and sabotage enemy orders they’ve been entrusted to carry out. Render enemy efforts useless, wasting their turn and limited resources. Strengthen the loyalty of agents to prevent them from being exploited. Investigate agents to reveal any enemy influence. Send traps down the network that will reveal enemy infiltrators if tampered with.",
