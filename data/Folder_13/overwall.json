    "About the game": "Your country is counting on you ! Play as engineer pandas in local coop, you and three of your friends to defend the Great Wall of China from the predators that attempts to go over it ! You have to cooperate efficiently to make diverse firework ammo, and use them with your weapons to defend your position. Gather your enemies with the fan to shoot them all at once, move the lantern to get a view on the wall, reload the turret for your last chance firework, and much more ! Try and obtain the highest score on levels always more crazy, with new traps and mechanics, to strengthen your bond with your friends... Or not. OverWall is a game created for a 2nd year's school project at Interactive Art &amp; Design, Montpellier. The goal was to create a coop game inspired by Overcooked. The project has been made with the help of the students of Audioworkshop school, who made the sound design of the game.",
