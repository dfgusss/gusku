Your aim is to free some creatures, the Bumbi, who have been trapped by their wicked brother inside some impenetrable boxes controlled by a sophisticated hydraulic system; the tremendous hydroblock. It will seem very easy to disactivate this system in the beginning, but the more you explore the worlds and get through the various levels of difficulty, it will be necessary to engage yourself in a physical and mental manner all the while enjoying yourself and feeling satisfied. Explore all the worlds where the wicked one has confined his unlucky brothers, free them and unblock the accessories to customize your own bumbi, that is, your personalized hero in order to disactivate the hydroblock. With so many smoking gimmicks, famished monsters, insidious candies, turbulent seas, your adventure accompanied by original music and sounds will unravel through fantastic environments and will be enriched with funny characters that'll make you laugh and have fun while you are busy dealing with numerous difficulties. Through the editor who'll let you create personalized game levels to challenge other players in the community you will make Panic Pump an infinite game.",
