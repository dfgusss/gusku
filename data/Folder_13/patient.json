Only questions, the answers to which are hidden in his past he does not remember. The main features of the game: * Patient is a classic point and click adventure. During the game you will plunge into the rather inhospitable atmosphere. Don't expect that everyone around you will be glad to meet you or you will be someone special. But who knows what awaits you. * You have to solve various puzzles, break locks, communicate with hermits, hide from guards, remove the curse and do many more interesting things * The game has various Easter Eggs and references",
