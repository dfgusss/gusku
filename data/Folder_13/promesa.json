    "About the game": "Promesa is a personal project born from a conversation between a grandfather and his grandchild, where you wander through their dreams and memories. While listening to someone trying to remember their experiences, past and present blend together, forming a stream of images that are both personal and shared. From memories of homes and streets to surreal visions of imaginary places, Promesa is a contemplative experience about what happens when we’re left dreaming of the things we haven’t lived firsthand. A slow and relaxing experience focused on contemplative exploration. Every playthrough (of approximately 45 minutes) is different and it takes more than one to see all the scenes. A distinct visual style that mixes pixel graphics with high-def light. Visit dreamlike environments inspired by Argentinian and Italian cities. A personal project born after a few conversations I had with my grandfather and made by a small team of 4 people. An acoustic soundtrack that uses many different instruments: from piano and double-bass, to zither and harmonium. Promesa has been officially selected at the following festivals/exhibitions:",
