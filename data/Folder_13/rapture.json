    "About the game": "Rapture is a turn based procedurally generated dungeon crawler with challenging but fair combat. Your objective is to explore the depths of Rapture - an otherworldly dimension that slowly devours time and space, threatening the very fabric of existence. Your team is tasked with finding the source of Rapture and putting an end to it, securing the future of humanity and time itself. Procedurally generated dungeons filled with different enemies, events and items. Each session should never be identical. An in-depth turn based combat system that requires you to take full advantage of your party's skill set and to act strategically to succeed. A large cast of characters, each with it's own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Extensive party customization with various items and upgrade terminals. Further customize your characters by learning new abilities as you progress through Rapture. Compose your ideal exploration party from a number of different adventurers to choose from, each with their own strength and weaknesses. Discover which adventurers work best together and develop your own strategies from a large cast of playable characters. Every character has their own set of abilities and an exclusive starting Relic that makes them stand out from the rest. Rapture is constantly growing and changing. Each session you'll be faced with different challenges as the layout of Rapture shifts constantly. Rapture features procedurally generated dungeons with randomized relics, events and encounters to keep each session unique. Make your way through the various different layers of Rapture, with each layer becoming increasingly more challenging the longer you descent. Each layer has it's own set of boss encounters, ready to stop adventurers in their tracks as they make their way deeper into Rapture. Throughout Rapture, you'll discover powerful Relics that can be equipped to your characters to provide them with bonuses and various passive effects. Experiment with various different combinations and synergies to unlock your party's full potential. Your characters can be further customized by reaching the Terminal Room. Spend your hard earned currency on upgrading your party's attributes and restoring their lost vitality. Teach your characters new abilities to prepare for the challenges waiting for you in the layers of Rapture. Interact with mysterious Data Crystals scattered throughout Rapture to change a character's abilities to match your needs.",
