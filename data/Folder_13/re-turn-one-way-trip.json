    "About the game": "Re:Turn – One Way Trip tells the terrifying story of five college friends on a post-graduation vacation. This might be their last trip together before the adulthood swallows them whole. Unfortunately for them, a far more sinister force has found them and hungers for their souls. When Saki awakens in the middle of the night to find that her friends have disappeared from their campsite, she is soon lured to an abandoned train. It stands silent, as if has been waiting for its final passenger to board. Waiting for her. As Saki searches the train for her friends, the barrier between the past and the present starts to dissolve. Otherworldly horrors confront Saki as she begins to learn the train’s deadly secrets. Re:Turn—One Way Trip is a tale of unrequited love—and unrelenting terror!
