    "About the game": "Explore places that were out of reach before Realities brings real world locations into VR - interactive &amp; with stunning photo-realism using photogrammetry. Too many amazing sites are too far away, too expensive to get to, closed off to the general public or too dangerous to visit. Explore those places and discover their stories. Walk through the desolate vastness of Death Valley. Explore the eerie abandonned hospital Beelitz Heilstätten in the former GDR. Marvel at the amazing architecture of one of the largest cathedrals of the world, the Cologne Cathedral. Feel the confinement of a cell in Alcatraz. Set foot inside the ruins of an 800 year old Staufer castle. Realities is regularly updated with new locations! Exploring is possible with the HTC Vive &amp; the Oculus Rift",
