    "About the game": "Rolling in the Reef is a dice-driven strategy game about guiding your fishy friends to thrive in their coral home. You are a Sea Spirit, sent by Poseidon to skillfully manipulate a pool of fish-dice, repel reef invaders and dig up treasures in the sand. Features: Unlockable artifact powers and multiple playable 'schools' of fish! Weekly challenge mode with leaderboards. Ladder/ranking system + procedural generation for endless replayability. A satisfying strategic experience in 15 minutes or less. The game combines and remixes many elements of euro-style designer board games like Castles of Burgundy, Troyes, Sagrada, and many more to create a thoughtful, interesting and deep experience. A large collection of unlockable artifacts and 'schools' of fish together with BrainGoodGames' staple single-player ladder and random map generation ensure that Rolling in the Reef has plenty to explore. Rolling in the Reef is the 6th game from Canadian game design studio BrainGoodGames, creators of Militia, Axes and Acres, SkyBoats, Minos Strategos and Solar Settlers. BrainGoodGames is committed to making fun, engaging single-player strategy games that combine random generation with a single-player ladder so you can enjoy our games for as long as you like!
