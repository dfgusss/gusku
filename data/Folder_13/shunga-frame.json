    "About the game": "Shunga (春画) is a type of Japanese erotic art typically executed as a kind of ukiyo-e, often in woodblock print format. While rare, there are also extant erotic painted handscrolls which predate ukiyo-e. Translated literally, the Japanese word shunga means picture of spring; 'spring' is a common euphemism for sex. Shunga Frame is a traditional jigsaw puzzle that anyone can easily play. Amazing atmosphere, great music, high quality Shunga artworks, great for relaxing. Ideal for relaxing after a hard day at work or an exhausting gaming session. Shunga was probably enjoyed by both men and women of all classes. Superstitions and customs surrounding shunga suggest as much; in the same way that it was considered a lucky charm against death for a samurai to carry shunga, it was considered a protection against fire in merchant warehouses and the home. If it is a digital puzzle, there is no need for a large assembly space, a wooden frame to decorate the finished puzzle, and worry about losing the last piece. You can assemble the puzzle on the monitor and view ready-made illustrations of Shunga at any time.
