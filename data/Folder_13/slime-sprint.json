    "Name": "Slime Sprint",
    "Release date": "Jan 20, 2021",
    "About the game": "The Basics: Sprint through lava ridden dungeons and attempt to achieve the best time possible in this arcade style, challenging 2D platformer. With 30 levels and 120 medals to achieve, becoming the best will be no easy task. With integrated steam achievements and leaderboards, there is plenty to play for in this challenging platformer. Levels and Obstacles: The levels in Slime Sprint consist of three stages. Firstly a dungeon theme with many spikes and lots of lava to avoid. Secondly a snow level with added icicles and slippery platforms, then finally the third set themed around meadows with harder jumping obstacles, flying rocks and more spikes. While the stages start reasonably easy, worry not, they become much more difficulty the further you progress into the game. If you get stuck on a specific level, don't threat, you can always skip it and come back later. Medals and Coins: Each level has 4 medals: bronze, silver, gold and diamond, but only the truly worthy can beat the hardest time and achieve the diamond medals. Earning medals will reward the player with gold to buy new skins and trails, although this will not make the levels any easier, at least you can attempt to achieve greatness in style. Leaderboards: With built in Steam leaderboards, you can see your position in the global community and how you compare with the best. Your score is calculated by multiplying your level time by one hundred, so the lower the score the better. You can also see how you hold up against those on your steam friends list. Skins: With 10 skins to unlock and more coming, there is a skin for any style. Pick up gems and complete levels to earn gold to spend in the store. Trails: Trails refers to the dust particles that follow the player when jumping and changing direction. Earn gold to unlock more styles of trail along with bigger and longer trails. Be sure to try and match your trail and skin, we wouldn't want you looking unfashionable.",
