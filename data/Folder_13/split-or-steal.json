    "About the game": "Split or Steal is a light re-imagining of the Game Theory concept of The Prisoner's Dilemma . Two players will be selected from a pool of online users, and are presented with a potential reward. The players are given a maximum of 2 minutes to speak with eachother – at which point, they can then choose to either share, or attempt to steal the reward. Earn an honest fortune, or steal your way to success - then spend your winnings on building a Headquarters to amplify your earnings in an idle/incremental-style fashion, running heists against those who wronged you, or just buying one of over 140 different cosmetics to show off in-game with. And, if you don't manage to alienate people by stealing from the entire planet, take advantage of the shared wealth and bonuses offered by joining an Organization! Fully cross-play compatible with all other Web &amp; Standalone releases, inclusive of support for importing existing player profiles.",
