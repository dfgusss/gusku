Explore a dungeon with four distinct areas, find the hidden key in each area, and unlock the chest in the center room. Seems pretty simple, right? No. You are being hunted. Every key, every step you take, will lead them closer to you. Don't make a sound. Don't attract attention to yourself. Don't let them find you. You have a gun, but it's not as simple as killing them. These things are unstoppable. A gun will only buy you a precious few moments to get away. You will not survive your first attempt, but you will learn. Gauge their movements Learn the layout of the prison. Learn where to hide and how. Map your route. Learn the possible locations of each item.",
