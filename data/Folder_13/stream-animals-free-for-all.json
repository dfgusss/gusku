If the birds and players don’t get you, events can still take you out! For Non-Streamers: If you'd like to customize your appearance for when you join streams on Twitch, there is an in-game store and customization section. Features Play with your stream chat through Twitch. Viewers can vote on events. 3 Game Modes: Classic, Battle, and Dash Up to 64 players from your stream chat. Map size scaling based on player count. 15+ Events that can be toggled on/off 10+ Map Layouts for Classic Mode with 3 scaling sizes 10+ Map Themes for Classic Mode.",
