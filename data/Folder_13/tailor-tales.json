Each guy has his own unique route so you can jump right in and experience a completely different story.

Tailor Tales will have 7 routes in the future and will get updated with each new finished route–there are currently 4 completed routes! The love interests Tailor Tales is all about the romance, so here's an introduction to the eligible guys: Neil is wealthy, prickly, and doesn't really want to interact with you. When you met Neil in your childhood–a memory he's very fond of–he mistook you for a boy. Now that you're an adult, he doesn't quite know how to deal with you. Be whisked away in his awkward charms, visiting masquerade balls and the opera. Complete Dimitri is the younger brother of your ex that cheated on you. When Dimitri is a college student and looking for a room to rent, you somehow end up inviting him to live at your boutique. He's sweet, easily flustered, and loves to cook for you. But he's also 4 years younger than you! Maybe living together will bring you closer. Complete Caine is a slippery thief with no tact. When you see him getting bullied at his part time job, you take pity on him and help him out. While he can be loud, rude, and unable to really express how he feels, Caine just needs a little push in the right direction–even thieves can get lonely. Complete In an alternate reality where people have superpowers, you design costumes for superheroes. James has the ability to fly but one day he literally crashes in front of your boutique. James looks like he'd rather throw you off a skyscraper than listen to you. He's stoic and rarely expresses his emotions. But then, you get kidnapped... Complete Aiden is chatty, kind of flirty, and makes you laugh–online, that is. You meet Aiden playing a popular online game and you want to meet up. Except when you do finally meet him, you realize... you've been catfished! In reality, Aiden is a bumbling fool whose social anxiety forces him to keep running away from your wrath. Note: Only the first several chapters for Aiden's route are free to play. Coming 2022 - currently in development This smug specimen is Gray, your rival gang leader in high school. Except he doesn't know that you're the leader and ends up taking a liking to you. Years later, you meet Gray again when you've started your own boutique. He demands you rent out your basement to him, so he can run his 'board gaming group'. Except you start hearing strange sounds coming from the basement... Once a delinquent, always a delinquent? Coming 2022 - currently in development Set in the 18th century, you are engaged to the duke... but suddenly, you're executed? You wake up to find you've been sent back in time before your execution. Immediately you appoint Eeyok as your guard, as he was the only person who tried to save you from your execution. Eeyok is wary of you and your intentions, but he will sacrifice his life to save yours. Coming 2023",
