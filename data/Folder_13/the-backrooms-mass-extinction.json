    "About the game": "(Some VR headsets might have compatibility issues. I don't own all of the headsets yet to test with and it could take a while to add support for some due to my budget. Thank you for your patience.) Currently Tested Headsets: • Oculus Rift • Meta Quest 2 If you're not careful and you noclip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms. The old moist carpet, the mono-yellow rooms and the hum-buzz of the fluorescent lights will be your only comfort in the endless purgatory you have found yourself in. Don't bother crying out for help. Nobody is coming. Nobody is left. Level 0 (The Lobby) Level 0 is the first level of the Backrooms. Level 0 is a non-linear space, resembling the backrooms of a retail outlet. It is a collection of infinite randomly segmented rooms, hallways, and staircases. The wallpaper is a mono-yellow, the carpet is damp, and the ceiling is decorated with office lights. Some walls have electrical outlets, security cameras, or mold growing on them. The installed lighting flickers inconsistently and hums at a constant frequency. While most areas of Level 0 are lit with a mono-yellow light, some areas are in total darkness. Other areas have dimmer than usual lights and some areas even have colorful lighting. The Backrooms: Mass Extinction is a game created by Mitchell Hepburn using Unreal Engine 4. It is currently in early access and will receive updates and new content as the game develops. In the current build, you can: • Explore a massive Level 0, a maze of non-Euclidean rooms stretching infinitely in all directions. • Explore Level 0.2, a sub-level called 'Remodeled Mess'. • Explore Level A, the Poolrooms! • Use vending machines to avoid dying of hunger or thirst. • Use your trusty torch to light areas shrouded in darkness. • Search for the Manila room, which can be found behind a wall you can noclip through. • Discover books documenting the levels. • Play on Desktop or VR; seamlessly switch between regular and VR play modes! • Interact with the Poolrooms water in VR and regular play modes! • Splash the water with your VR controller! Upcoming build will include: • Entities (Partygoers and Smilers) • Level Fun =) • Level 0.1 sub-level",
