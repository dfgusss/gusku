YOU are a hunter; a man or woman of wealth and leisure who has turned their time to fighting the fiendish monsters that assail humanity. Approached by the poor villagers of Pale Harbour, and informed that a terrible evil has arisen from the sea, can YOU unravel the mystery and drive back the beasts? A choose your own adventure novel in which your choices and actions can lead you to glorious victory...or ignoble defeat. Explore an original story with three challenging game difficulties, unlock hidden lore to better understand the world you enter, and enjoy the artwork you discover in the gallery. This independently produced novel features a dark soundtrack (with optional atmospherics), as well as over 40 unique page images to unlock. The text of the game has also been recorded by a professional musician and story-teller, making it into an interactive audiobook.
