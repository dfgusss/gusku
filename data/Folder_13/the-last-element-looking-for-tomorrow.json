A megalopolis that has become a 'melting pot' of architectural styles borrowed from all over the world . . . . Images from the West to the East merge to form buildings of many stories, which seem familiar and alien simultaneously. In this city, movement stretches upward, reaching the highest towers under the clouds. 'The Last Element' is a new world in the arcade racing genre. Get behind the wheel of a flying car of the future and participate in dizzying races, where you can overtake the cars not only on the side but also from below or above. Take a leading position in the ratings of drivers from around the world. Take a fresh look at races without borders! In the game there are five detailed locations that convey all the stunning spirit of Cyberpunk! Are you ready to visit them!?",
