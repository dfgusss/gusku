    "About the game": "The Wizards Who Fell In A Hole When two of the most magically gifted wizards on this (or any other) planet set out on a quiet stroll one evening, neither of them are aware of the terrifying adventure that awaits them. They only have themselves to blame for bringing it on, however, as they fail to see a giant hole in the ground and take an absent-minded wander straight into it, leading them to a cave of unspeakably horrible monsters. Their only way out is to navigate through 100 deviously dangerous levels... ...which is where you come in! The Wizards Who Fell In A Hole is a one- or two-player platform game in which each player controls a wizard who can jump and shoot at a variety of monsters, with the aim being to kill all monsters on a level before progressing. There are special items to give you various power-ups and help you along the way, and lots of tasty food to be eaten to rack up the high scores and extra lives.",
