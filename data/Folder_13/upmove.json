    "About the game": "A dream on the wind floats to where the trash collects. Stray cats watch me leave. Perichron Interactive presents UpMove , a typing game x cave flyer... ...about pushing your limits in pursuit of an ambition... ...and maybe going a little too far. In UpMove , only the power of language can propel your intrepid craft as you fly through cities and countrysides and giant factories, dodging meteor showers and laser beams and traffic jams as you strive to make that one last delivery that you need to move upwards and onwards. Your journey will take you through 11 hand-crafted levels, ranging in difficulty from moderate to extreme, and will challenge both your typing abilities and your piloting skills. Above: A pleasant suburb. Above: A pleasant shower of hull-shattering death rocks. Above: Watch out for traffic! Inspired by classics like Space Taxi and Thrust , but with a keyboarding twist and a 1-bit style inspired by early Macintosh games, UpMove offers an experience that is both new and authentically retro. Choose how you want to play: you can race through its levels to put up ever-faster times on your leaderboard, fly more carefully to get through as many levels as possible before your lives run out, or turn on infinite lives and fight to unlock the hardest levels. Type for your life! Typing powers your ship, and being able to recharge quickly in mid-air can make the difference between arriving at your destination and...not. Authentic retro ship controls : you can only apply thrust in the direction you're facing, so you'll have to manage your momentum carefully! An unusual hi-res monochrome style , which takes its cues from the earliest generations of Macintosh games. Build up your skills over a wide difficulty curve. The earliest levels focus on testing basic piloting skills, while the hardest ones are designed so that beating them represents a significant accomplishment even for cave flyer veterans! Traverse varied environments , from countryside levels to cityscapes to factories filled with deadly machinery! A thematic journey . Where lies the line between humility and sloth? Between ambition and greed? How do we better ourselves without losing who we are? Explore these questions, and more, in...",
