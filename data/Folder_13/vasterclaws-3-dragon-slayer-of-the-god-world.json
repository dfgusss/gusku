    "Release date": "Mar 18, 2020",
    "About the game": "*The game text has been fully translated into English. The gameplay focuses on raising your soldiers' levels, strengthening their weapons, and balancing their unique traits and skills to create the strongest squad possible. Lead your ultimate squad deeper into the realm of evil, or try it skills online against other players' squads and move your way up the online ranks. [Story] Two beings of the 《human world》 hold holy power: 《Shrine Maiden》holds “The Holy Power of Transition, 《Dragon Slayer》 holds “The Holy Power of Dragonslaying”. These two souls resonate, and the soldiers of the 《human world》 assemble to face the 《evil dragons of the God World》. You must become the 《dragon slayer》 or 《shrine maiden》to defeat 《Lord Vaster Dragon》 and his monsters to free the 《God World》 from his terrible power. Enter the belly of 《the dragon》 and release the 《spirit hoard》 of Gods and men that are trapped within. [Focus on the Engine] 'Lixel 2,' our in-house developed engine, uses CPU commands rather than GPU or hardware implementation to render each pixel individually. These efforts have resulted in low-power, low-temperature graphics rendering. Lixel 2 excels at control at the pixel-level, and at this level, rendering is much faster than in engines that rely on GPU or hardware. *This game uses a legendary skill known as 'vram[n]=color,' handed down for generations, for all graphic rendering! [Artistic Game With Handcrafted Details] In addition to wonderful graphics, every facet of this game was designed and constructed with care to create gameplay with a feeling of 'zero seconds loading time'. Players will enjoy a stress-free, immersive experience. [Quest for Timeless Entertainment] We believe that truly interesting games will be just as fun to play again 10 or 20 years later. Our small team’s dream is to create an awesome game that will be loved forever. Of course, gamers have personal preferences, but we hope that this game will become one of your all-time favorites. [Q&amp;A] Q) What's the different between the Standard version and Special Pack? The Standard version lets you play through the initial game to the end. The Special Pack(DLC) opens up the post-clear Backside and Claws world. Q) How do I change my soldier portraits to rare soldiers like the Sword Master? When Force has risen to a certain level, you can change soldiers' names from the Details screen. For Warriors, enter 'Kensei', 'Master', 'Kenshin', or 'God'. For Valkyries, enter 'Konken', or 'Spirial'. For Shooters, enter 'Izanagi', or 'God'. Their appearance will change! (This will not impact strength.)",
