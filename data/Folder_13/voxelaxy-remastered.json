    "About the game": "Voxelaxy [Remastered] Hello Astronauts! After almost 3 years and a big break on Voxelaxy, I've come back with the biggest Update Voxelaxy has ever seen. I've rewritten everything to bring you new gaming experience! The old game in a new Remastered Version! For those who have Voxelaxy (it's free - it's just an update), for those who are new, there is a fantastic price! Welcome to the new era of Voxelaxy! Voxelaxy (the combination of two words: Voxel &amp; Galaxy) is a space survival game. The spaceship, which he calls ''Mouse'', has been destroyed suddenly by a missile. He had to land in an emergency on the Unknown Planet. Using only a limited set of tools, you have to survive in a hostile environment. Crafting oxygen and finding food seems almost impossible... Are you ready? The Unknown Planet You have landed on The Unknown Planet. Are you ready for colonizing your own planet on your own terms? What's your plan for the economical use of land? Remember, the map never ends! Key features: Voxel graphics-style. Randomly, infinite procedurally generated worlds.",
