    "Name": "VR Jetpack Game",
    "Release date": "Jul 1, 2020",
    "About the game": "Physics-based VR with full freedom of flight. VR that feels and controls like a real jetpack. A real-time multiplayer VR arena. Players can fly and interact with each other online in VR with realistic physics-based controls. The controls are completely VR and natural, just as you would use thruster controllers for a real jetpack (look up Jetman as an example). It's truly free range of motion and natural movement, not the teleport or D-pad controls of most VR games. This includes but is not limited to being able to hover, drift, spin, flip, and burst through the sky without ever hitting any special buttons (all controller angle/position based). It's up to your own imagination what combination of moves or positions you might be able to do in the air. You can even now swing and do hookshots with the new grappling cables. Note that this means you can and will go upside-down. Like with roller coasters, skydiving, or any other real-life thrill or extreme sport, this experience is not for everyone, but for the right people, this comes very close to feeling like flying (and swinging) in real-life. The game is currently being released as Early Access, as the core mechanics and flying functionality along with multiplayer have been done for over a year now. The slowest part of development, and what is taking the most time for me as a 1-man team, is the more traditional parts of the game, such as map building, graphics, and other assets. If anyone is interested in helping work on these items, feel free to reach out on the VR Jetpack Game website. Longer term, once the more traditional parts of the game are done, the game will take a more open-world / sandbox direction as a testbed to integrate other projects of interest, such as introducing some of my plans for the AI project at Conatus.ai (and we can see if people realize when the other players aren't human).",
