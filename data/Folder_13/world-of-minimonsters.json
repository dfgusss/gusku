To be able to beat the final boss, you should level up your MiniMonsters. What better way to do it than with potions? POTIONS - Buy potions to make your MiniMonsters stronger or change its stats. But you will need gold to buy them, then... LET'S GO ON ADVENTURES! - Each level has 3 different adventures, 2 easy and 1 not so easy. While you are overcoming adventures, you will get gold and new potions for your MiniMonsters. You will need to have specific MiniMonsters to reach the victory. So, you should manage your group of MiniMonsters as better you can. Are you ready to FIGHT? - Beat 3 different MiniMonsters in each land to reach the next level, but be careful!
