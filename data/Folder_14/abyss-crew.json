    "About the game": "Abyss Crew is a multiplayer coop game aboard a steampunk submarine. Each player is a member of the submarine crew - pilot, gunner, sonar, or engineer. Explore the abyss to find precious mineral - but beware, as sprawling menaces lurk in the darkness... Will you play as the pilot, the gunner, the sonar or the engineer? Each station features a unique and complementary gameplay. Pilot station Explore the oceans depths, and pursue hostiles creatures - or try to escape them... Sonar station Scan the abyss, identify hidden threats. Who knows what's lying in the darkness? Gunner station Load, aim and fire torpedoes. You're controlling the ship weapons - to defend or to attack... Engineer station Upgrade your ship to increase your survival chances. Or do you prefer to keep materials to repair potential breaches? Abyss Master (optional) Play as the abyss itself. Control fauna and flora to repel the the intruders in their iron cask! Year 1923. Recent discovery of orichalcum, a powerful mineral found deep in the oceans, triggered a new industrial revolution. Now, countless submarines roam the depths in search of rich veins, leading to underwater conflicts. But seamen are speaking of greater threats hiding in the abyss... Abyss Crew can be played on local or online games. Online games requires one license per player. LAN games need only one version of the game; other players can download the free demo to join LAN games. If you are less than 4 players, bots will manage missing stations. Abyss Crew is inspired by FTL for its genius ship management system, Star Trek Bridge Crew for its innovative gameplay, and Sunless Sea for its marvellous ambiance!",
