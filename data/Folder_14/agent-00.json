    "About the game": "Agent-00 is a puzzles and stealth game in isometric view, where the player embodies soviet spy, who will have to infiltrate(or go undercover) in the USA, with the help of a scientist called Aleksandr Popov. Go inside government buildings, steal classified information and slip past by using your special skills in order to lead the Soviet Union to victory in the Cold War. Rotate rooms Turn rooms 180 degrees so you can discover what is hidden in the invisible sides. Every room has two sections, a visible section and an invisible section. When using the rotation mechanics, the room will spin and the sections visibility will change showing the hidden elements. Use portals to move around Agent-00 will connect the doors amongst portals in order to travel through the buildings without being exposed, and mislead the guards who patrol the facilities. But this skill can become a double-edged sword; if a door is connected to another door which remains not visible, it will be imposible to link the portals. Unlock new skills The spy will find different ítems he will be able to use in order to get over the various problems that he will find in the future. Unfortunately, these skills are limited and cannot be used every time you want them, that is why you must be careful when and how you use them. Face a powerfull enemy In the middle of the Cold War and with just one contact, Agent-00 will have to infiltrate in an enemy country and destroy it from the inside. The USA government will not stand idly by, and they will defend the facilities where a secret project is being developped, with every available resource, from armed security up to changes in the physics as we know it. Be careful.",
