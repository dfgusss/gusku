As the Chief - you manage your clan’s camping, shifts, equipment, resources, crafting, trading, travels and most important - the Hunt . ▏ Hunts are main source of field experience for Hunters under your lead, and reward for a successful Hunt - your funding. Extremely difficult and dangerous , as the spawns of Darkness takes various shapes - each one more deadlier than the other. ▏ On a Hunt, there is no place for blind bravery or brute force - those will only lead to your end. Instead, the key tactics are stealth , paying attention from where the wind blows, traps, ambushes and swift, accurate strikes. There is no room for mistakes and each - is being paid with life and blood . ▏ Only carefully threading your actions, strategies and wise management of your scarce resources - does give you a chance of survival. Then something happened. An old friend, but with a stranger’s face. Blind eyes, that saw something they weren't supposed to. Silence, replaced by whispers. Whispers, replaced by screams. And the curtain of this wounded world ...is about to fall .",
