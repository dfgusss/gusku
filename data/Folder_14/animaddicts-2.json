    "About the game": "Animaddicts 2 is a Beat Em Up Game based on the 80s Cartoon for 1-4 players. If you remembered watching the 80's cartoon series and had fond childhood memories of it, you’re going to appreciate this side-scrolling Beat Em Up game. You can love how the visuals or animations remain true to the old cartoon series, cheesy, but goooood, just the way its meant to be The Filmation cartoons, because of their constant use of animation, kind of looked like a videogame in many occasions. So we was thinking of how cool it would be to see a game with old cartoon graphics. Features and Content One Character to choose and play Levels with different themes and enemies Controller Support This game has Full Controller Support.",
