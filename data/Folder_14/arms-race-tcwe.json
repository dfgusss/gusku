    "About the game": "The Cold War was not won with diplomacy. It was instead won by many successful international military and espionage operations conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union. From the creators of The Cold War Era, comes the long awaited sequel. Arms Race. Arms Race - is a single player two options ( RTS or Turn Base ) strategy game based on the events of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets spanning the 1950s through to the 1990s. Within a few hours of gameplay, players will travel through four decades of contention, paranoia, secrecy, and the overarching 'us vs. them' mentality.
