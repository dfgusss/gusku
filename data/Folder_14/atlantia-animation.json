    "About the game": "Atlantia is 3D animation software which allows untrained artists to easily and quickly make animated movies. It works at a very high level of abstraction so users can issue 'walk here' or 'say this' style commands. Users can then spend most of their time focusing on the story, instead of the tedious aspects of animation. The software includes a growing library of built-in objects and animations. There are text-to-speech capabilities so that users can quickly write dialogue and automate lip-syncing. A custom, high performance inverse kinematics system helps automatically generate dynamic animations and pose characters. The terrain and sky can be easily edited to support many different environments. All of these things together make it very fun and easy for an average user to make high quality animations. Please give it a try!",
