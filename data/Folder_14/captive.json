    "About the game": "You wake up in a bright, but mysterious room. You don't know what is happening or how you got there. You see a TV, a trash can, a desk, and a closet. There are objects throughout the room, but most of them are hidden. Some of them are easy to find. Others are not as easy. You must click in specific areas to find these items and figure out how to use the items together to escape. How can you turn on the TV? How can you unlock the drawers? What will you find in the desk? Where is the key to open the main door? What is outside of the door that is keeping you inside? Can you solve the puzzles to find out how to escape? Or will you be stuck? This is a point and click adventure game where your character is stuck in a room and you need to solve some easy and some complex puzzles to try to figure out how to exit the room. You don't know why you are in the room, but you must figure out certain aspects of the room prior to leaving. Your goal is to leave. Explore the room, find items and use them to your disposal. Open the items you find. Use the items together and use them in different areas of the room. If you're stuck, think harder. Will you remain Captive?",
