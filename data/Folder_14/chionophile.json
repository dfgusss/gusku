    "About the game": "Chionophile is a very short experience about the mood of winter in the woods. It is a slow paced pure walking simulator; you only walk, slowly, in the wilderness away from civilization. A beautiful poem from Archibald Lampman accompanies your short journey; and the original music score that is composed by Pınar Karabaş. The game has 2 chapters. While the first one is a little linear, the second one (which is more expansive) takes place in a large open area. There are paths for the player to follow to reduce confusion about where to go. But you are free to roam away from the path and discover. PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood. Save progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each chapter.",
