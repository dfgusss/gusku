    "About the game": "In the distant future, when technology had integrated into our life so firmly that it was no longer possible to state that there was anything real left in people, cryptocurrencies had firmly integrated into our life and people who considered the creator of bitcoin a savior had emerged! All over the world, sanctuaries where people could leave a donation and virtually talk to Satoshi began to appear. An orphan, Drew, barely out of tech school, was sent to one of these sanctuaries to keep an eye on it. One day, the sanctuary's servers and all the bitcoins on them got infected with an unknown virus. Now, Drew has to embark on a long journey in search of an antivirus. Without even knowing it, he's also the only one who has the power to stop the war between good and evil. Or not... Features: - Unforgettable adventures from the 3rd person. - Non-linear, deep story-line that unfolds as you progress. - Three different endings. - Well-developed characters. - Specific cubic low-poly graphics. - Bright cyberpunk setting. - Secret location. - Great music.",
