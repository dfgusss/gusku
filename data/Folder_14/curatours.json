    "About the game": "Museum of Plastic 2121 is the first museum tour available on Curatours! Built 100 years from now in an imagined future where things have worked out well for both the planet and humanity. Visitors can uncover the story of plastic - its history, science, industry, and impact on our environment. They will learn the importance of establishing a circular economy and find out how activism and individual action happening now will lead to positive change in the future. Every Thursday in November 2021 we will be opening a new wing of the Museum of Plastic. Curatours is a social tour platform for culture and heritage. Visit incredible places filled with art, artefacts, stories and friends. Visitors can access tours of museums around the world from desktop, phones or VR headsets. In VR it's an incredibly immersive experience and on other devices it feels like a cross between a video call and playing a multiplayer game. Curatours is free to download and offers three types of cultural tour: Self-guided Self guided tours can happen at anytime, just login and go exploring! Pre-recorded This is similar to a self-guided tour only at points a guide will appear to tell you something about that place or the artefact you’re near. It’s a bit like a 3D audio guide. Live-guided The live-guided tour experience puts you in a digital space with an expert you can talk to and ask questions. To get a live-guided tour you will need to book on to one of the timeslots available. Tour groups will be around 12-15 people and you could organise to meet your friends. It's vital to us that a social element is always possible within the platform, but you can also enjoy Curatours on your own, at your own pace, in a self-guided tour.",
