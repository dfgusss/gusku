It's gonna' take you places. But at least it's better than dying. Collect keys to unlock gates to get those delicious delicacies while avoiding strange threats in a 2.5D arcade collection game, or at least that's the game some of the time. Read your diary, or don't. The game has several different endings based on your performance, and a number of alternative paths based on your choices and how you're doing. This game is a psychedelic trip into a simple yet chaotic story of a girl who's too delicious for her own good. FEATURES: A psychedelic and colorfully strange 2.5D style.
