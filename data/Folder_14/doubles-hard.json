    "About the game": "Doubles Hard is a game inspired by a legendary production Boulder Dash , created by Peter Liepa and released by First Star Software in 1984. Unlike the original Doubles Hard game, diamonds are collected on a three-dimensional board. The player can move up, down, left, right, in and out. There is also 'grab' move. The use of the three-dimensional board has made it possible to design completely new levels that put the game on an even higher complexity level. The two-dimensional version of Boulder Dash has been implemented in a huge number of ways and enjoyed well-deserved popularity. Adding a third dimension increases the level of difficulty, but also the satisfaction of gameplay. Features of the gameplay: 45 levels (and one extra) All classic blocks available (diamonds, boulders, grass, lava, enemies, walls) A new kind of block: the bomb! Keyboard and pad support. The first game referring to Boulder Dash , played on a three-dimensional board! If you try, there will be chaos on the screen. But this chaos is under control. Under Your control!",
