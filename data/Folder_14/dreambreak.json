    "About the game": "'This looks like the most terrible mix of differing types of gameplay. I must have it!' - RPS Commenter An authoritarian state pacifying the masses with propaganda. A brutal police force that shoots first then shoots some more. An ordinary everyman named Eugene, dragged by coincidence and circumstance from a life of mundane menial tasks into a baffling world of sudden, inexplicable murder, hidden conspiracy and unrelentingly lethal robots with nasty sharp pincers and lasers coming out of everywhere. Depicted in a distinctive Cyrillic pixel art style the cyberpunk city crackles with tech-noir intrigue and neo-digital deceptions. Using every tool at your disposal help Eugene to unpick the knot of mystery that he has become enmeshed within – your equilibrium will be rocked as you point and click a path through this briar patch of tangled meaning and unexpected quixotic quirks. Will Eugene make sense of the conundrum that unfolds before him, learn who is an ally or a foe and collect lots of vinyl records for his listening pleasure? He'll race rapid hover bikes to earn sub-cultural respect, rub shoulders with high society in a post-modern nightclub, hack the brains of pursuing drone cops in thrill-packed chase sequences, strive to survive tense shootouts with merciless law enforcers and enjoy some 8-bit cowboy coin-op action in a dingy dive bar with a broken toilet. Multiple endings Unique blend of action, point and click and Russia Get fingered for murder Soviet Bloc Edition contains DreamBreak game with good Russian stuffs like: Original 19 track soundtrack recorded by Egor Gritsukov (.mp3 &amp; .wav) Digital art book (.pdf) Pack of 5 Wallpapers Walk-through (yeah good luck with that!) in Russian and 'English' (.pdf)",
