    "About the game": "Drop up is a twitch based puzzle game, where you guide a circle to the end circle by clicking, and holding and drawing a line. Drop up requires steady hand movement. Drop up has sixty-nine levels. Drop up is $1.99. Each Drop up level is 2.88 cents. Each Drop up level may or may not be worth 2.88 cents to you. I hope Drop up levels are at least around the 4 cent level. This way players will be getting their money's worth on a level by level basis. Drop up has many items that affect the game play. Drop up is punishing. Drop up is also rewarding. Drop up is not a simple game that anyone can just beat. The last level in Drop up, is pretty cool. You have to complete every other level in Drop up to play the last level, I'm sorry. Drop up has a level editor. Drop up can not cure cancer, I'm sorry.",
