    "About the game": "This game will crush you. Face merciless gameplay to explore a cursed castle, discover the dark tales of its inhabitants, and kill the gods of a decaying world. Eternal Return combines retro graphics and old-school mechanics with modern nonlinear level design and storytelling. Survive to Explore Slow pacing combined with tight yet unconvential controls builds stress, tension, and horror during gameplay, rather than taking a hack &amp; slash approach. Players build their health, stamina, and arsenal up from nothing - and earn points by killing enemies to use special weapons to fight their way to the next shortcut. Discover a Story Speak to NPCs, find written messages, muse over paintings, and explore story-filled architecture to learn or infer the forgotten tales of the crumbling castle and its fading inhabitants - including yourself. Features: Starting with 1 health and 1 stamina to be built up by exploring for upgrades Stamina management-combat Unique controls for toe-to-toe combat No Air controls! (How do they do that, anyway?) Realistically-paced attacks for strategy rather than spamming 3 primary and 3 secondary weapons Gathering points to use secondary weapons Returning to your place of death to recover points Looping level design around only one central checkpoint with unlockable in-universe fast travel for great immersion Locked doors and optional secret areas Hardcore areas with invisible enemies and other crazy challenges Secret healing checkpoints to help further your exploration 9 NPCs with voice acting and subtitles 20 Levels 13 Bosses 50+ unique enemy types Discover phonographs to find the game's soundtrack 64 colors! Philosophy! So many jars and barrels that need smashing.",
