    "About the game": "Update 1.3 - Beta support for Oculus VR Headsets is now live! In this forest, there are only two rules: Survive. And loot as much as you can! Eyes of the Night is a fast-paced, creepy game about finding treasure in a forest during the dark of night, while avoiding the deadly wolves who hunt you! Collect gold while finding healing potions to restore your ever-dropping health. Your flashlight comes in handy, but the battery drains quickly and recharges slowly...and it makes you more visible to the enemies! Can you survive the night? Eyes of the Night is a fun little project written by a father and son (14 years old) team making their first game together. And though it’s a small, quick paced game, it is an addictive challenge! We are continuing to update Eyes of the Night with free content additions, including new gameplay modes and art content! Key features: Creepy, dark forests with randomized tree and loot placement Multiple difficulty settings for all experience levels Accurate night cycle with changing weather conditions “Deathrun” mode for a hardcore play style Dramatic sound effects, including the player’s pounding heart, which beats faster as enemies move closer! New in 1.3 Update : Virtual reality support for Oculus headsets (beta) New in 1.2 Update : Stealth Mode gives a slower and more deliberate style, as you try to stay quiet and out of sight of enemies New in 1.1 Update : Nightmare difficulty provides an even greater challenge! Headphones and dark surroundings recommended for best experience. Lama glama Game Company was founded by a game industry veteran and game design teacher, now an indie game developer because he doesn’t like to wear shoes at work and wants to go fishing on Fridays.",
