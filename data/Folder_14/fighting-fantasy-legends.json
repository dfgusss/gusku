Play through three iconic Fighting Fantasy gamebooks - City of Thieves, The Warlock of Firetop Mountain and Citadel of Chaos. Discover these classic adventures in a whole new way! Create your own adventures in a dangerous land full of monsters, treasures and traps. From renowned authors Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone (co-founders of Games Workshop) and Nomad Games, Fighting Fantasy Legends is an epic role-playing card game set in the classic world of Fighting Fantasy. Can you survive the dangerous streets of Port Blacksand, the murky depths of Firetop Mountain or the looming shadows of The Citadel? Featuring a dice-based combat system unique to Fighting Fantasy Legends, where you level up your dice as you play. Choose to increase your strength or your luck, so that you can increase your chances of dealing devastating damage to your opponents and evading deadly traps! Never experience the same adventure twice! Each location has treasure, monster and event cards for you to uncover, shuffled into a deck you then draw from. Will you stumble into a deadly trap? Or encounter a helpless villager looking for their saviour? With unique cards in each location, expect danger around every turn. Unveil cards to discover fiendish creatures, powerful objects and dramatic events as you play! Thousands of choices as you play, making each game unique. Powerful adversaries, such as Balthus Dire, Zagor the Warlock and Zanbar Bone. Kill monsters and add them to your Creature Codex. Iconic characters, such as Nicodemus the Wizard, Gareth Yaztromo and O'Seamus the Leprechaun. Unlockable titles and achievements for completing challenges. Permadeath mode - not for the faint hearted!",
