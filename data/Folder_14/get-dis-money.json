    "About the game": "A game about gangsterz in space getting money. Explore worlds while collecting alien bounties in an arcade style, 2d rougelike action platformer. Features The game was built in this cool new thing called a 'Fantasy Console'. In particular, I built in PICO-8. This means this game got them retro vibes, and I had to write some crazy code to fit in that 32k code size limit. And to my knowledge, this is going to be the first PICO-8 game on the market, so that's preety cool! Battle Through 3 different worlds, as you get the most money, and beat your fastest time. And if you are crafty, encounter a few secrets along the way. Bring a friend with Two player co-op on desktop devices. Rougelike elements will have you pulling your hair and cheering for joy on the gentle but steep difficulty curve. Unlock 2 additional characters in the shop, that will change the way you play.
