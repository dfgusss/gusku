    "About the game": "Hi, with no money and only goodwill, I embarked on the game creation adventure this year with Unreal Engine 4 part-time. Despite the difficulties and my lack of experience, I decided to make one of my childhood dreams come true. What is Gewevo : Interstellaire ? It is a real-time space strategy game inspired by the universe of Gewevo where you have to develop your planets, colonize others and conquer the last. There is also a more wargame oriented approach to some aspects of empire management. To put it simply, this is it. What is Gewevo ? Gewevo is a science-fantasy univers and a tabletop RPG originally (findable on Lulu) which is expanding regularly with novels (also found on Lulu and Wattpad) and now a video game. Why that strange name of Gewevo ? Why not. Why such simplistic graphics ? Because I have no talent for it. Implemented features Random map generation ; One race with one faction ; Construction of buildings on planet ; fleet and ship production ; Tech tree ; Division customisation (HoI4-like) ; Ship customisation ; No microtransaction.
