    "About the game": "Game Modes: Over 30 levels where you must protect the magic ball until it reaches the portal. Endless mode in which you must protect the magic ball for as long as possible. Gameplay: Move the dots attached to the line using the mouse in order to reach the portal at the end of each level.Push the magic ball with either one of the dots or with the line that connects them by moving the dots towards it. Challenges and Hazards Collect bonus objects by throwing the magic ball at them. The magic ball can be destroyed if it hits the bottom platform or if it is hit by a projectile. Some areas can be accesed only if one of the dots pushes a button or if enough magic balls are collected in a designated area. If the line intersects a platform its power will disappear and it will no longer be able to push the ball until it doesn't collide with a platform anymore. In split-screen levels interact with the objects at the bottom in order to move the objects at the top. Interact with the environment in order to trigger events. Levels with mutiple lines where you have to move the lines such that the ball will bounce from one to another in order to move through areas that are inaccessible to either one of the lines. Levels which have no magic ball. In these level you have to rely solely on your line to navigate the level however you may interact with other objects in order to reach the portal at the end. Areas in which the line cannot move through but the ball can, so the ball needs to be thrown and reach another line or deactivate the line blocking zone in order to progress in the level.",
