    "About the game": "The world has been cursed by an ancient, plant-based, cosmic being known as the Haustoria. Take control and repel the overwhelming entity! Haustoria is a 2D puzzle-platformer featuring a unique 'thumbtack' system where players pin and unpin game objects in the world. Set in an unforgiving, hand-drawn picture book style world, players will progress by solving puzzles using the magical thumbtack. Make your way through a strange forest, explore a cursed house, crawl though dark caves and avoid dangerous traps in an old dungeon (and more!)",
