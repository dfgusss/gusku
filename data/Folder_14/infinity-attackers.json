    "About the game": "The Mission The Infinity is an endless source of power, used for good all over the galaxy. Recently however, a group of space pirates know as the Drognoks have made it their mission to destroy The Infinity, and harvest the remains for power and greed. Your mission is to defend it from their onslaught of battle ships, and save the galaxy from their reign of terror. The Game Infinity Attackers is a basic space shooter game. Your objective is to defend The Infinity from waves of enemies. The Infinity changes position each wave, and every 5 waves a new modifier is added to the game to change things up. It could be something good, like all coins that enemies drop are worth double, or it could be awful, like all coins enemies drop actually damage the player.",
