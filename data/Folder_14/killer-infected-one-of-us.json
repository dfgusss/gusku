    "About the game": "The game takes place in 2040. From the headquarters of Arctic comes a statement about finding the new organisms. You and your team are going to a research expedition to study the unknown organisms. The research gets out of control and one or even more people are infected with a new unknown deadly virus 'Virus-40'. The virus clouds people’s judgement and forces them to infect the others with a deadly virus in order to ruin the expedition. Players are divided into 2 roles: •Infected - whose main goal is to infect everyone else, to deny being infection and blend in with other members of the expedition. •Healthy - find the infected person and cure him/her with an antidote and prove that you are healthy to others, and also to survive it is necessary to maintain the station in staff state. If the antidote is administered to a healthy person, then the medicine will have the opposite fatal effect. Features: - Voice and text chat - Exciting quests - Bonus system - Secret locations - Nice soundtrack - Anonymous voting - Beautiful visuals",
