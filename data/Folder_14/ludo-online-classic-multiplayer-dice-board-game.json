    "About the game": "Ludo Online is a strategy board game for two to six players, in which the players race their four pawns from start to finish according to the rolls of a single dice. Two, three, four, five or six can play without partnerships, players can be human or computer-controlled, playing on the same computer or across the internet. At the beginning of the game, each player's four pawns are staged in the player's yard. To enter a pawn into play from its yard to its starting position, a player must roll a six. Each player throws once each turn unless he throws six, when he has another throw. The pawns are moved forward as many squares as the dice indicates. Players may not end their move on a position they already occupy. If the advance of a pawn ends on a square occupied by an opponent's pawn, the opponent pawn is returned to its yard. The player who moves all of his pawns in the home row first wins the game. Second and third places are determined based on how many pawns players have gotten home.",
