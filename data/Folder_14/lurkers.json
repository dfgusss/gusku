    "About the game": "September, 1888. The shadow of the Whitechapel Murderer looms over London. Eddy Nichols, the eldest son of the first acknowledged victim, arrives at Whitechapel in search of answers. What he finds, though, is a panic-stricken city and a number of people eager to make the most of the horrible crimes: an American private eye, thirsty for fame and glory; the owner of an awful tabloid; a psychiatrist who advocates for suspicious, questionable methods, and an elusive, mentally unstable journalist. Experience the investigation surrounding the Jack the Ripper crimes putting yourself on the shoes of one of the protagonists in this thrilling mystery Visual Novel!: Around 35k words of mystery and romance. Two (optional) LGBT love interests. Three suspects. Three endings, depending on your choices. A gripping original soundtrack. Rating 15+ DISCLAIMERS: This story is based on well-known true facts, and most of the characters are inspired by real people. However, their personality and actions during the Whitechapel crimes are mostly just fiction. The deprecating statements about England were a common opinion among the working class of Victorian Britain, and by no means represent the opinion of the writer.
