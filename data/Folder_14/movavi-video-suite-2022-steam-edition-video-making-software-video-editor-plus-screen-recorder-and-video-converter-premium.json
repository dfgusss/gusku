Manage your footage on a convenient multi-track timeline and don’t worry about large files – thanks to the Fast Track HD technology, your computer won’t freeze while working with Full HD and 4K videos. Try basic editing: trim, rotate and enhance clips, color-grade videos with lookup tables, join files with transitions — especially, transitions with the built-in sounds. When you’re done with the simple tools, try advanced features — Chroma Key, Stop Motion, and Object Animation, — insert stickers, logos, and titles. Cut, trim, and sync audio, normalize volume, tweak equalizer settings, and more. You can even create your own intro from anything you can find in the program: backgrounds, titles, stickers, callouts, and even music. Then save the clip and use it in every video you create. Convert Files at the Speed of Light Make sure your gameplay videos can be seen on any platform or device — thanks to 180+ supported formats and 200+ available mobile presets. You can use those presets to transform files to any smartphone, tablet, and laptop. Even the newest devices are available. Thanks to the SuperSpeed, you can convert files in no time, plus use other types of hardware acceleration: Intel HD Graphics, AMD, NVIDIA NVENC and CUDA. Before the conversion, you can perfect your clips. Scale up the timeline and use frame-by-frame preview to find the fragment you need. You can now cut your clip with pinpoint accuracy thanks to the time spinbox. Just set the right time to delete unwanted footage. You can also add filters, reduce the ‘red-eye’ effect, insert watermarks, and change brightness and contrast. Grab Everything From Your Desktop Capture any activity on your desktop: live streaming, video chats, webinars, and program usage. Overlay a webcam video, and you’ll get a real live screencast. You can also record audio and webcam video without recording the screen. Now it’s possible to draw on videos during the recording: leave comments, add arrows and geometric figures, and highlight the main objects. You can edit screenshots, too: crop, rotate, and add text. Another cool feature is the recording scheduler: choose date and time, and the program will record your screen at the right moment. Even More Tools Easily share captured or edited videos via YouTube or Google Drive Send file links to your friends via Telegram and WhatsApp Automate video making with the Montage Wizard: just add the footage and enjoy the result Split videos into multiple clips with one click Watch videos and listen to your favorite music via a handy media player Transfer data to CD, DVD, or Blu-ray Capture video from any external device – webcam, TV tuner, or VHS",
