    "About the game": "Following the footsteps of internationally successful MU titles (MU Online, MU Origin), MU Legend offers an authentic alternative to the dungeon crawler gaming experience. A game with its own unique signature, MU Legend blends the dark fantasy world of an MMO with the richness of hack 'n' slash gaming. Enhancing the key features that have made the ARPG genre popular over the decades, MU Legend allows the imagination to run wild through a world of RPG myths and legends. 'Rich PvE and PvP Content' MU Legend gives players unparalleled access to a wide array customization and a vast range of PvE and PvP content. PvE-driven players can enjoy a great variety of features: From procedural solo &amp; co-op dungeons to legacy MU content such as Blood Castle &amp; the Endless Tower, players are spoiled for choice when it comes to hunting for the greatest gear. For PvP aficionados, matchmaking and ranking systems allow the most skilled players to rise to the top and get the recognition they deserve: Warriors can not only face off in classic 1v1 battles, but can also claim victory in 3v3 team brawls. Plus, guilds can get in on the action in a massive tournament where up to 16 guilds compete fiercely for 1 territory. In MU Legend, PvP players have all the opportunities they need to shine on the battlefield and make their mark on history. 'Experience the difference of MU Legend with fast-paced &amp; action-driven gameplay of a new kind.' 'Immersive, powerful atmosphere' From the very first level, MU Legend evokes a sensation of almightiness. In best hack 'n' slash tradition, but unlike most current action RPG games, all classes in MU Legend possess powerful area-of-effect skills right from the start, making levelling a truly thrilling and satisfying experience for players of all levels. 'Character and Skill Customization Unleashed' MU Legend offers deep and sophisticated character skill customization, which is a dream come true for those skill-tree designers out to satisfy their curiosity or improve their gameplay abilities. Each character can be customized and tailored to fit any player's gameplay methods! 'Suitable for Low- and High-Spec Computers' Play MU Legend on a wide range of systems: Powered by Unreal Engine 3, MU Legend is supported both by more modest PC configs as well as those with the best hardware setups.",
