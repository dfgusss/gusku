Explore the secret passageways, interact with strangers, dig for records, and get hypnotized by the soundtrack – a batch of original music courtesy of the band, Archie Pelago. Welcome to Off-Peak, a game created by Archie Pelago cellist Cosmo D. In the game, players will uncover a world where the fate of it's musicians and artists is unclear, yet their tools of the trade are highly prized. Meanwhile, the station itself provides all the comforts a commuter could ask for: great food, the best beer, entertaining board games, relaxing gardens. But who is really benefiting here? It is entirely up to the player to what degree they want to engage in and interpret Off-Peak's stories, characters and themes. Gameplay Off-Peak is a first-person adventure game that takes place in one giant area with multiple nooks, crannies and hidden passageways to discover. Within its own bounds, the game can be explored at any pace or direction the player so chooses. On average, the game takes roughly 20-30 minutes to play in its entirety. Off-peak Is freeware.",
