    "About the game": "Ohayou! Beginner’s Japanese is an educational game that will teach you the basics of Japanese Hiragana and Katakana. Asuka, an enthusiast teacher, and Kenji, a not-so-enthusiastic ninja, will be responsible for educating you. You will use digital flash cards to give more details on a chosen Japanese character, such as its romaji relation and a vocal pronunciation of it, just like you would in a real japanese class. When you think you’re ready to test your knowledge, you can then participate in the memory games where you choose the correct cards that match up with an indicated romaji or vocal sound using a sword. Score high in the various levels of the matching games and you will become a Hiragana Samurai and a Katakana Ninja! New lessons and characters will be added continuously as we expand the game's features as DLC!",
