When future generations recite your saga, will they sing of your glory or your downfall? Saga of the North Wind is a 300,000-word interactive fantasy novel by Tom Knights, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.
