    "About the game": "Hey there! I am Stint, a connoisseur of vintage games. After another raid on a flea market, I returned with a wonderful loot - an unusual CD that caught my attention with it's unusual cover. The monster, poorly drawn on paper, seemed to come to life for a moment while I was digging through the piles of junk. That's interesting... A platformer that promises action, shooting, lots of puzzles and unstoppable fun is a good choice for the night, according to the description. I had hardly ran the console, when the glitch appeared. It's hard to say how many mistakes were made in the game's code, but at some point i found myself inside the game's world! Developers, it is not funny! Your game is so bugged, it tore the Fabric of the Universe, and i was dragged into the game! Am I supposed to fix bugs for you, so that i can get out of here?! What planet is this messed up game from!",
