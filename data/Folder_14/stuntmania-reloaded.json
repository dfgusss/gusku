    "About the game": "StuntMANIA Reloaded is a fast paced 3D car stunt driving and exploration game, where you get to perform the most amazing tricks and stunts in some really cool environments. New in StuntMANIA Reloaded is the ability to drift and slide when driving to take some amazing corners and to produce some awesome burnouts and donuts! We have also added the ability to perform many more mid-air stunts, including flips, twists and flat spins. You can also automatically re-orient the car by pressing the Jump button while mid-air to achieve the perfect landing. Stunts are only awarded if you land properly, to practice you landings! Exploding cars Cars now have a Damage Meter. If it gets to 100%... KA-BOOM! You explode... then re-spawn in a random location. And.. when you explode, your car breaks into bits that stay in the level, so you can drive into them and push them around. It's insanely fun.. so on, try it out! ELEVEN Unique Cars You can select any of the ELEVEN amazing stunt cars each with differing suspension, weight and handling. Any car can be played in any level in any game mode from an easy to navigate game selection menu (once you have unlocked them). ELEVEN Amazing Levels Choose from ELEVEN unique driving environments, filled with stunt and trick ramps, bonuses and hidden challenges including an awesome Power-Ups that will allow you to take your tricks to a whole new level! Collect COINS to unlock content Each level in Go Crazy game mode contains 1x Game mode coin, 1x Level coin (in 3 pieces) and 1x Car coin (in 3 pieces). Collecting each coin allows you to spend them to unlock other levels, cars and game modes from the main menu. Can you unlock everything? Fantastic new Music and Sound FX Each level has it's own new unique Music track... from Rock and Electric to Zany and Fun, and it never plays the same twice in a row. The new Music and SFX in StuntMANIA Reloaded will really get your blood pumping! Awesome POWER-UPS Each level has randomly placed Power-Ups for you to find and when you do, you will have some amazing new abilities to help you reach even the highest points in a level or the hardest to find areas. * Note: SMR graphical requirements are VERY high. If you encounter slow performance, please lower your quality settings and resolution in the Game-Options screen. Especially when using older Mac hardware. * Note: Not recommended for Macs with integrated Intel GMA950 Graphics as found in pre 2009 Mac Mini and pre 2008 MacBook.",
