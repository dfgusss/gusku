    "About the game": "The elders spoke of one who would bear the mark of the mountain wolf. That person is you. Prophet. Warrior. Wolfbane. Wait! Sorry, wrong game. This is a goofy game about a magic dog. Super Cane Magic ZERO is a local co-op Action RPG for 1-4 players. ‘Cake’ the wizard is dead, and his pet dog is on a magical rampage. Crash-land in the psychedelic world of WOTF, throw yourself into frenetic combat and save the world/dog. Fight mutant vegetables, dodge banana-boomerangs and eat rocks. Yes, you can eat rocks. Crazy twists and narrow escapes and await you in the 20+ hour Story Mode. Master the arts of Dogmancy and Candygenesis as you travel the treacherous hills of Minestronya. Explore a vast world crammed with characters who are so off-the-wall they make Humpty Dumpty look like he’s still ON the wall. Have a brawl with up to 3 friends in Arena Mode. If you have more than 3 friends – ask them to leave! Studio Evil have tapped directly into beloved Italian cartoonist Simone ‘Sio’ Albrigi ’s brain and scooped out a wild adventure that has non-sequiturs coming out the wazoo. MAIN FEATURES ONE CRAZY STORY, COMING RIGHT UP -- 20 hours+ of hilarious story and characters from legendary Italian cartoonist Simone 'Sio' Albrigi. GET LOST -- Explore a huge world full of hand-crafted story quests, plus 3 procedurally generated dungeons. FIND YOURSELF -- We made a really enhanced RPG progression system and were dumb enough to use it in this weird game about magic dogs. Explore and upgrade 7 skill trees, with hundreds of unique items and perks. JOIN THE PARTY -- Be a Baker, Plumber, Candy Wizard or Influencer, and unlock 15+ playable characters with unique mind-bending abilities for use in both singleplayer and PvP. RUIN YOUR FRIENDSHIPS -- Play the entire game in local couch co-op* or go head-to-head across 8 furious local-multiplayer arenas! EAT EVERYTHING YOU FIND -- Turn loot into power-ups with this unique mechanic. Eat at least four types of rock!** * Local couch not included. ** In the game. Can’t stress that strongly enough. NOT MAIN FEATURES Levers. Exploding bacon. Sophisticated jokes about butts. YOUR JOURNEY BEGINS WOTF is planetoid. You are a comet. Can I make it any more obvious? Absolutely nothing will become clear as you venture out in search of the six sorcerers who have gone missing from Poptarts Academy. Deliver delicious damage as Dude , a baker with the power of bacon! Confront angry fire-people as Dudette , the unstoppable plumber! Defrost the laser volcano as Dudward , the Candy-Healer-Wizard! Be like, totally awesome as Dudorah the influencer! Bust out of jail. Defeat monsters. Fling croissants. Yes, there are walking cakes – but this ain’t no cakewalk.",
