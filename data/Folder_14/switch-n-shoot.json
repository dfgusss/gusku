    "About the game": "Calling all pilots: Earth is under alien attack! Your assistance is required! No experience necessary. ONE BUTTON: Piloting an advanced star fighter with just one button is simple: you switch, you shoot. Every shot fired changes your direction, and mastering this is the key to becoming a legend among the stars. Timing is everything! QUICK. SIMPLE. CHALLENGING: Don't underestimate its simplicity; this game tests your reflexes like no other! And while your ship might become stardust in a matter of seconds, you can instantly jump back in for 'just one more go'. RETRO ARCADE FEEL: A love letter to arcade classics with crunchy pixel art, chiptune soundtrack, authentic cabinet artwork and compulsive gameplay. Only now you don't need a stack of coins to stand a chance at getting a High Score. COLOUR PALETTES: Unlock 64 palettes that completely change the look of everything in the game. Choose from 8-bit favourites or create your own! PORTRAIT MODE: At the touch of a button your screen rotates into portrait mode (a.k.a. TATE Mode) for a truly authentic arcade experience. The game supports a wide range of controller setups so how you play is up to you.",
