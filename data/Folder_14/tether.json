    "About the game": "What is Tether Tether is an abstract arcade platformer about elastic connections and arcing flights. Attach your tether, then swing into the beyond. You can enjoy Tether as a relaxing meditation, or up the tension with arcade modes. Features Infinite worlds to swing through 4 different arcade modes Original music to swing to Global leaderboards 20 Achievements Dark mode for night time swinging Zen Mode Find your flow in Zen mode as you freely explore a world of graceful momentum and arcing orbits. Or up the tension with... Arcade Mode Tether has 4 different arcade modes to compete in for high scores: Free Score points based on your speed and direction. Speedy upward motion gets the most points, while staying still or falling gets the least. Avoid colliding with blocks for as long as you can. Timed Like free mode, but with a 2 minute time limit, Pursuit Score by evading an inexorable pursuer for as long as possible. In this mode you can smash into blocks at will. If you are going fast enough, you'll break them apart enabling you to escape more easily. Daily Race Race to the finish. Score by getting to the objective as fast as possible. The generated world for this mode is changed every day and the leaderboard is reset daily as well. How to Swing I'm sure you mean... ahem... swinging is a different thing. How to play Tether Tether is simple to learn, but hard to master. Left click to tether to a block Left click while tethered to a block to retract your tether Right click while tethered to a block to let go Credits Created by Amar Kinstan Music by Jonathan Oakley Additional coding by Mathew Rundle",
