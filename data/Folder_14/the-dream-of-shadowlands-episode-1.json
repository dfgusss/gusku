    "About the game": "CONTENT WARNINGS: Body horror, suicide, blood, strong language The Dream of Shadowlands Episode 1: Into the Darkness When someone is truly hated, they may find themselves forced out of the safety of the light and into the unforgiving dark. Rina wakes up lost and confused in a mysterious new world, learning she has been cursed. Reluctantly teaming up with a plain-spoken demon named Jyl, they find themselves in an underwater dreamscape that appears anything but ordinary. Stumbling upon a cult's plot and facing off with fearsome monsters, the Shadowlands prove to be a treacherous place. Rina must face her first challenges in order to survive the long journey ahead of her. 'The Dream of Shadowlands' is a top-down RPG series inspired by the RPGMaker horror niche. It features art assets that were drawn traditionally with ink and paper, and a retro style based on 90's anime. Note that this game is fully voice-acted, with most of us in the cast being amateurs. If this is something that puts you off, voice acting can be turned off in the game's settings! This is the first episode in a series planned to run for 5 episodes.
