    "About the game": "Thunder Rally is a ridiculous local multiplayer demolition derby you can win even without your car. Smash your opponents' cars off the field. If the drivers survive, run them down before they steal your car! SMASH YOUR OPPONENTS off the field to claim victory. Drifting into your enemies will add extra punch to your impacts, so drive with some flair! FIGHT ON FOOT if your car is flipped over or knocked off the field. You can flip cars over with your fists of steel, just don't get run over in the process. USE CRAZY POWERUPS teleported into the rally. Sticky bombs will blast cars off the map, heat-seeking missiles will vaporize wiley drivers, and the black hole launcher is great for when you need serious cleaning power. RAIN FIRE AND CHAOS after your inevitable death as a catapult loaded with explosive barrels. Each driver killed means yet another catapult in play. PLAY AGAINST THE CPU if you don't have enough friends nearby, or just need a little more chaos!",
