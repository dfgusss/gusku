    "About the game": "This game will provide students and scientists tools for brain anatomy studies. Why this game in brain studies? We have learned about humans have the most intelligent brain among animals. The human brain has been evolved from a rodent-like animal, which were in particular similar to rats. Rodents brains are a powerful tool for humans brain studies, because a lot of structure and connectivity are in common. 100 million mice are sacrificed in USA laboratories every year. This game is designed for students for brain anatomy studies or brain studies scientists. This game brings the real training without sacrificing real life of rats or mouse. Lastly, this training can be played in any place and any time with very low cost. A quick note from the developer: Do you want to find cures human brain disease, like Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and Schizophrenia? Scientists use animals to study human brain. The brains from rodents such as rat and mouse in laboratory has been used, rodents brains are much smaller than human brain, so it is easier to study the structures. The genes for Human brain and rat brain are 90% identical, and rodents has been a good model for human disease studies such as Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and Schizophrenia. This game offers you: Rat Brain Tissue Experience Rat Brain Experience Rat Whole Brain Experience Right Hemisphere of the Rat Brain Experience Hippocampus tissue Experience 18-20 days Pregnant Rat Experience Postnatal Day 0-1 Rat Pup Experience Do you want to learn how to Isolate specific tissue from rodents for your research? Human brain diseases are start from abnormality in the specific brain region. For example, Alzheimer’s disease patients in mild case shows neuronal death in hippocampus, and those in severe case shows neuronal death in cerebral cortex. Studying specific tissue are is very import for human brain diseases. However, the technique to isolate tissue from mouse or rat brains is very difficult, and takes a lot of time and practice. This game will allow you to experience adult mouse, mouse pups and mouse brains as much as you can, before you handle real rodents models.",
