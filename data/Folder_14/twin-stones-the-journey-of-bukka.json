Both characters keep talking the whole journey, about the story, hints, and funny commentaries. ● Scenario Explore the world of Samshara, a wild place where nature has taken control of everything. 3 different scenarios over the course of 5 levels, startingwith a wooded mountain, the mount Kinui, and the ancient city of Darmah, before the God’s Temple. Overcome all the challenges on your path or finding all the hidden coins. With a variety of movement interactables, such as hook, moving platforms, wall jumps, jump-ladybugs, bash jumps, bouncers, ramps, 2D zones... challenges feel fresh and exciting. ● Enemies Fight against the ferocious enemies that you will encounter through your adventure. Each beast has its own mechanics, movement set and different difficulty levels. ● Art Enjoy the game with the amazing views that each level offers, but also take care and look carefully around each clear zone to know exactly where you are thanks to the art from the levels, and each landmark useful for identifying andas a reference point. Our art team took care of each detail on the levels, along with the handcrafted characters. ● Music All the music has been exclusively written for the game by 3 artists from Berklee College of Music in Valencia, and recorded by the Budapest Art Orchestra.",
