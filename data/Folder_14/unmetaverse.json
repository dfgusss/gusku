    "About the game": "VRSNS for people who have no friends I tried VRSNS, but I couldn't get used to the community and quit. Do you have any such experience? Many VRSNS and online games are designed on the assumption that you have friends. Rooms that only allow friends. Content that requires multiple players. Bonuses for inviting friends. Unmetaverse is a VRSNS for people who don't have any friends. No voice chat We've eliminated the biggest barrier for shady people: voice chat. No more checking your microphone every minute to make sure it's not unmuted. In Unmetaverse, everyone is mute. There is not even text chat. Gestures are the only means of communication. Open World The Unmetaverse world is a huge 10km x 10km open world. Everyone shares the same world. Unmetaverse is large enough for you to get away from the hustle and bustle and spend some time by yourself. No need to create Unmetaverse is not a service for creators. Everything you need to enjoy the world is already provided for you. Build houses, gather nuts, cultivate land, and develop your village. You don't have to be a creator or an influencer in this world. Everyone is equally a pioneer here. You are the star of this world.",
