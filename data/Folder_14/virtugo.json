    "About the game": "What is VirtuGO VirtuGO is a classic puzzle game. Colored tiles come at you nonstop, and you must put them on your carrying platform and arrange them as best you can on a 5x5 grid. If you match 3,4 or 5 tiles in the same color horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the blocks get destroyed, you score points and free up space for more tiles. VirtuGO can be played on regular PCs with keyboard and mouse, but also supports VR gameplay. Vive and Oculus (Touch) headsets and controllers can be used to play VirtuGO in VR. There are 100 levels in VirtuGO and as you level up, you’ll encounter new color tiles, and they’ll come at you faster and faster. For each 10,000 points you score, you’ll get a WILD tile that you can substitute for any color. Visit the games community page to see the possible combinations and scoring details. VirtuGO will get addictive as you try to better your personal best and earn a place on the global leaderboard. Have fun! Scoring and Combo Points Horizontal Combos Vertical Combos Diagonal Combos Special X Combo Multiple Combos on 1 drop gives you extra 20% bonus points",
