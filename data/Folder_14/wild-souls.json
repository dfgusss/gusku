    "About the game": "Plant a tree, watch the forest grow. Wild Souls is a chill ecosystem sim with no time pressure, inspired by Don't Starve and Zoo Tycoon. Build your own world like you would a garden, experiment which animals and plant species can live together, manage and balance the populations, write YOUR stories. You start as a Souls Keeper : a being with the power to gather the souls of recently deceased animals and plants. Those souls can be offered a new life, in a new body. But which body ? You decide. Decide which species you're gonna choose to build your own world, plan ahead, improvise, experiment . As you learn the specific needs of each species, you'll get closer to a perfectly balanced ecosystem : follow the bloodines of the creatures you added, watch their offsprings grow, and witness the stories of their lifes. A mysterious guide will show you the way Plant a proud willow by a river. It may die, put down by a beaver or the thunder. Or survive long enough to become the elder of a massive forest, shelter to many forest-dwellers animals... What will it's story looks like ? Key features : Collect souls as a currency, spend them wisely to add new creatures and plants. Create different biomes by painting which climate should each part of the map belong to Control any animal : you can now try to survive in the very environment you created ! Observe your world evolve, see the livings interacts with each other in a lot of ways Follow the rythm of seasons : Winter can be a difficult time for all, but in the Spring flowers will regrow on their own ! Relax : listen to the sounds of nature, the music, and release stress Unlock new species by completing little quests Seasons will change the look of the landscape : Fire is a dangerous hasard, animals will flee before it, but some may not be that lucky... Before you decide to get the game, you should know : Wild Souls is in its early stage of development. Wild Souls will be in early access for quite a time (several months at least), and will continue to get updated ( new species, less bugs ) a long time after it's 'final' release. It's an ambitious project made by a solo dev that I don't want to rush, or let un-updated shortly after it's release. If you decide to start the adventure, you and your feedback will be very welcome in the discord community !",
