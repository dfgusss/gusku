    "About the game": "Witchsword Remake is a story driven, 3D roguelite indie A-RPG. The game takes place in a medieval style fantasy world. The player will play as a swordsman and begin an epic adventure to unveil a conspiracy to overthrow an empire, and to take part in a deadly contest for a powerful ancient artifact. 1 Challenging combat Combat in game is mainly real-time sword fighting with a focus on immersion and realism. The player can dodge, parry, and unleash a deadly combo or use special attacks to quickly overpower the enemy. Combat in this game relies heavily on player's fast reaction and strategy. Also worth noting, most of the combat animations are high quality, motion-captured. 2 Roguelite features Random generation: the enemies, loots, and scenes that players will encounter in the game are randomly generated, which will be different each time they play. Instant Combat: operations such as combat are instant. Improved permanent death: the hero will automatically delete the previous archive after death, but will retain a certain proportion of gold and other parameters. 3 The difference between this Remake and the original game AI and behavior of all characters have been remade, and new enemy types have been added. The overall graphic style is low polygon model style now. This remake is more difficult and playful than the original.",
