    "About the game": "This is a different parkour game from the past, the game gives you a different image of the mythical animal, as well as different music. Also, we have added skill system to make the game more different. Besides,we have an escaping scene and an escape system in the game. Haha, you will like them. PS: We have adapted English, Russian, Portuguese and Chinese, which should be enough for you to use. When you hit the 'W' key to jump in parkour, you can press the number keys '1','2' and '3' to use three different skills.And skill 2 and 3 can be cancelled by pressing the 'S' key during using. Skills need to obtain by picking up question mark items , but priority to obtain life. With a certain probability you will enter the forest scene, at this moment,press 'A' or 'D' to run towards left or right. Press the 'S' key exit the grass.There will be a reciprocal time in the scene. Before the time runs out, you must enter the grass which will show up in a random position after a period of time. And then you will avoid bird's prey, otherwise you will be caught and then enter the bird-claw scene. The bird-claw scene is very simple. You just keep pressing the 'H' key until the red slot is full and you can break away and return to the parkour scene.",
