    "About the game": "Are you safe? Are you clean? Are you normal? If the answer's yes... you probably don't live here. A bride, cloned by a slug monster on her big day. A robot on the run from a 'Spork Jogger'. Two print and trophy shop owners addicted to LARPing. A celebrity chef with underpants that hold a terrible, terrible secret. A reclusive tyrannical business leader forcing everyone to sing... Must be Thursday. Yeah but what is it exactly?
