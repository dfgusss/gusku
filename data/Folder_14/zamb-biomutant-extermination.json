    "About the game": "Play as two special operatives and fight your way through a mad scientist's secret asteroid base whilst defending yourself against his army of evil mutants. The amazing brawler Cye is trained in melee combat and uses powerful gadgets of mass destruction; or out-smart the enemy with the master tactician Chrome, an agent of ranged warfare and master of AI turret defence systems. Develop the skills of your Agent, increase their power and overcome 24 uniquely challenging levels which get harder as you progress. Will you use a “punch now, ask questions later” approach? Or are you a tactical genius that tricks the enemy into bottle necks, melting them down with a devastating turret barrage? Play solo, or draft in a loyal friend for epic Co-op action. Use everything at your disposal in order to eliminate the mutant army and put a stop to their evil before it spreads across the universe. Final Game Features 24 Scientific Labs to Dominate and 3 Environments to Conquer – Hack the power cells in 24 action packed levels and take over the mad scientist’s asteroid base. 14 Powers and Turrets – Combining your strategic mind with a Brawling skill set you will have to use everything at your disposal to defeat the waves of mutants.
