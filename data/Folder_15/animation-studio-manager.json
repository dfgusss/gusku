    "About the game": "Animation Studio Manager puts you in command of an Animation Studio. Can you build up your Studio enough to win the big Golden T-Pose Award? Or will you fail and prove your mother was right all along? Will you stay Pure, or go Corrupt? You don't have to sell your Soul to get ahead...but it sure helps! Your Guide And Mentor...Your Mother Your Mom is a big-shot in the Animation Industry and when she hears you are following her career path, she is worried you might ruin her legacy! To prevent you from becoming a complete embarrassment, she helps you get started with a Studio, gives you some starting Money, but has no confidence in you. Prove her wrong, and she might just become your biggest rival and challenge you to an Award Show duel! After all, there can only be one at the top of the game, do you have what it takes to dethrone her? Build Your Reputation, or Fail Miserably! Hire a Production Crew to start making web-shorts and TV episodes - they may not be glamorous, but they pay the bills for now. You'll need to hire Writers, Animators, Storyboard Artists and more to begin your Animation career. If you still haven't gone bankrupt, you'll eventually need a Corporate crew - things like H.R., I.T., and Marketing - to really take care of your Studio and make it to big the Award Shows. As you build your Crew up, you'll need an Executive and Producer to continue to expand into full TV Seasons and Feature Films. They'll also help keep the Crew happy and help win over the Critics by improving your Rotted Potatoes Score. Perks: Minigames, Coffee, Corruption and Selling Your Soul Your Mother has clearly chosen to go the more Corrupt Pathway, but will you follow her, or stay Pure? The Corrupt Pathway offers more Perks, but makes your Employees and Fans sad, so choose wisely! You can also earn various Perks for your Studio in a variety of ways: play and win Minigames, upgrade your Coffee Machine or hire a Barista to Brew different Coffee flavors, or sell your Soul to get Soul Perks. Earn XP to upgrade your Crew even further to become the best Animation Studio ever! Winning Awards and that Approval You Desperately Crave Prove to your Mother that you're not a failure by earning her respect the only way you know how - winning Film Awards. Once you've built the Corporate side of your Studio, you can start winning Awards. Now you won't start competing at your Mom's level...there are a couple of tiers to get through first. But if you can win Best Picture at the Sell-Out Awards and the Space Rock Awards, you just might earn a spot at the Golden T-Pose Awards. Using every trick you have and with a little luck you just might be able to win against your Mom.",
