    "About the game": "Bangers &amp; Mash is a frantic, local-multiplayer, platform-fighter about brawling potatoes. In contrast to standard platform fighters where every character has over 14 abilities to remember, each Bangers &amp; Mash potato has only 5 unique abilities, making for a better casual experience. With less to remember, outwitting your opponents comes organically (like the potatoes themselves)! Features: Casual-ized take on the platform fighter genre An ever-expanding roster of 8+ characters Four unique levels from the Irish countryside Brawls between 2-4 friends (or enemies) Full Irish-inspired soundtrack",
