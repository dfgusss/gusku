    "About the game": "Become the best version of yourself. Become lean, athletic and insanely fit with Boot Camp Fitness! The ultimate cardio and bodyweight program, complete with an increasing number of exercise variations to follow along to for men and women as the game develops. Unlock rewards such as new exercise locations and climb the boot camp ranks, as you become fitter, leaner and stronger. Do you have what it takes to unlock all locations and achieve top rank? Are you ready to become the leanest, fittest possible version of yourself? Then bring it on! Let’s do this! Including 'Beginner' level which is very low impact and perfect for people getting back into exercising if it's been a while. No exercise equipment needed or VR equipment (optional would be just an exercise mat). Exercises and exercise algorithms built from advice and overviewing from fitness professionals. Each balanced workout is unique and never exactly the same as the last. Simply pick a workout time and difficulty level, then enable or disable bodyweight, core and flexibility exercises then hit START. The aim of this game. ' I genuinely want to help people reach their fitness goals . Boot Camp Fitness is intended to be an app/game where you just select the length of your workout, exercise preferences and then just hit 'Start'. Please note before downloading. You will need sufficient free space of at least 4 metres by 4 metres to workout in. This is a workout app with some game-like elements, where after configuring which types of exercises you want to include, the algorithms do all the workout planning work for you. Just hit 'Start'. This is not a custom workout creator app (yet). This game has a stoic, retro, old school vibe to it. Not VR . . . but the ideal accompaniment to VR games. This is a non-VR game, but if you already enjoy exercising using VR games, this app will be an ideal accompaniment, as this app/game includes exercises that are currently awkward to implement into VR games, such as press ups, planks, burpees etc, making sure you get an all round workout in. With special thanks to: Jadranko Duric - strength and conditioning coach at FC Meyrin. Menoli Dissanaya - licensed nutritionist. Bank - personal trainer.",
