'SECTOR-EFFECTOR 1.21 GIGAWATT SUPERSOUND!!!' THE GAME Explore the mysterious castle full of monsters and secrets in a quest to collect all the treasures (that will also protect you from the curses on your way) and crush the main boss. The game won't let you exit the castle, no matter how you try. Technically you can win, but there is no end. CONTROLS Press Enter to start the game Press 1, 2 or 3 to select a hero Strength, Intelligence and Dexterity at the hero selection screen are the maximal values which that hero can get. Strength is both for life and attack power, intelligence is both for mana and spell power. Dexterity affects your attack and defence accuracy. You lose the game when either of those parameters gets below zero!
