    "About the game": "Cataplexy is a short visual novel that combines incompatible genres of comedy and horror. It all depends on the chosen interpretation of events and the mood of the reader. To believe in the mystical nature of what is happening or to make out logical explanations. To be horrified by the state of hopelessness or to laugh at the comicality of the situation. This is for you to decide. Although the hero of our story in any case will have a hard time. Features: Possibility to choose the mood of the story: ironic or serious. Visits by various otherworldly entities. Backgrounds that combine hallucinations with reality. A non-standard view of a truly existing phenomenon called Cataplexy. A lot of story fragments were based on personal experience.",
