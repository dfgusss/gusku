    "About the game": "Lead the Chaos Brigade , a team of fearless space exterminators, in their quest to cleanse the galaxy from the filth of evil alien races. In this retro-arcade-platform-shooter you will assault drifting spaceships, wipe out the invaders and claim your reward. But be careful! Your weapons can damage the spaceship you are meant to save and can ultimately cause its destruction! Kill the aliens, save the spaceship! Action-driven experience: cleanse alien infested spaceships with the exterminator of your choice. Non linear adventure: more than 100 missions to complete and 8 alien races to deal with. Destructible environment: if not careful you might end up destroying the very spaceships you were meant to save. Brutal gameplay: deaths are permanent and a dead exterminator will no longer be accessible for the current game. Low Res Pixelfest! Original synthwave soundtrack. 100% solo-developed game. Chaos Brigade is a mix between the paranoia of the old classic Xenophobe and the sheer destruction of Broforce . Be brave. Be determined. Rule #1: kill all the aliens. Rule #2: don’t destroy the ship!",
