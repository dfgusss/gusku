    "About the game": "About this game: Kusan city, a city that eats people, everything is so ridiculous. Chronic economic stress has created large numbers of 'good citizens' in cities who are anarchist, 'hospitable' and love chaos. Kidnapping for ransom, bombing, hijacking and killing seem to be the most popular thing for criminals living in this crime-ridden city. What! Isn't there anything else to do? Other than that, I'm afraid sex and drugs are the only things that keep them interested, and they happen to have plenty of those. It all started with an explosion, and the Joker, the head of the biggest gang in the area, people thought he was crazy. He is leading the way to the great game he has been planning all along, and the local bug has long been dissatisfied with the government, and these will be his helpers to complete his perverted plan. Protagonist is a life in giant mountain city, can often go in and out of each big nightclub decadent special police, and you, will play him and lead the bizarre member of the police to deal with all sorts of difficult events, although it is to deal with every time, avoid trouble. But still one day trouble to tangle with you, the road of thorns how to go, you have to be careful. Or you're gonna lose everything. Gameplay: The game will test the player's reflexes and control skills. You need to watch your enemies' movements from god's point of view and plan your attacks in advance, otherwise a stray bullet will leave you bleeding. Open the plot mode, lead your teammates into the battlefield, break through the enemy blockade. Take a shot of vodka, don't waste a single shot, go all the way into the enemy. If you get blood in your face, don't wipe it, it will only make you more excited. Mr. Hostage you're still bleeding. Would you like a bite. The game will test the player's reflexes and control skills. You need to watch your enemies' movements from god's point of view and plan your attacks in advance, otherwise a stray bullet will leave you bleeding. In the game, you can choose to hit the face, back stab, or just throw the weapon in your hand to smash the enemy's skull, and finally throw a grenade, blow the whole field. If you hold a grudge against a bum, you should count your flares. Hey! If you don't want to get ripped off, use it well, because it's not just the enemy. The enemy fire will be more fierce than you can imagine, short charge, rough and powerful trolls, they even use the guard tower as a guard dog, you guess this can of gas will explode. Wait a minute! You can't pull something that big out of your pants! The people of this city are very enthusiastic, anyhow the players should be careful some, every party will come a lot of people, the scene is too chaotic, if the bullet is not enough you can borrow someone else's use, first of all he has to be willing, or you than his thick...... . One punch is no match for four hands, and sometimes you need to slow your enemy down in bullet time to improve your maneuver, sprint and jump, deftly dodge hospitable bullets, turn your enemy's onslation into a human stroke, and finally greet him with a friendly greeting. A person's night is always easy to lonely, you can attack together with teammates, two people, two 'guns', let the fight into a bloody performance. How about this design, which can be either a mindless slap on the face or a stealthy kill, each move pushes the story forward, and you need to discover the truth and survive to get revenge.",
