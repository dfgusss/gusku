    "About the game": "Warning: One of the core mechanics of this game is leaving your characters to grind experience points and items while you don't interact with them a whole lot. This style of play may be too passive for some. We recommend trying the free demo if you are unsure. Enter the post-apocalyptic continent of DarkSpar, where the races of Dwarves, Elves, and Men lost their war against the forces of darkness long ago. Rebuild civilization from a minor settlement into a grandiose castle. Recover lost technologies and ancient artifacts. Recruit champions and outfit them with ancient relics and a wide array of skills then send them into battle against ancient and forgotten foes Key features: 8 bit look and 8 bit feel. Turn-based auto-combat reminiscent of the flagship RPG titles of the 8-bit console wars. Old-school skill trees. Place points in 63 skills across three trees to customize your plan of attack. A different loot system. An RPG with no inventory management. It's quiet out here. No NPCs. No shops. Build all of your own equipment. Free updates. Five content patches since release incorporating new play modes, difficult settings, randomization, and player suggestions. A large content update planned for the first half of 2022. No Microtransactons. Complete game, one price. Not an incremental game. One linear story. Different games modes add replay value. Fully functional demo version (first 30 levels). Unsure if you'll like the game? Try the demo. Look for the button on the right of the store page.",
