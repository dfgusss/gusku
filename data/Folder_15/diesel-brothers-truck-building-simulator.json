    "About the game": "What's up, America? Diesel Brothers: Truck Building Simulator is a car tuning simulator with multiplayer and modding. Search for busted four-wheelers and transform them into legendary diesel-drinking monsters! Disassemble the entire car down to the frame and then rebuild it with whatever parts you want. Diesel trucks are a lifestyle and the garage is your new home. Fancy a 12-inch suspension? It's all up to you! Invite up to three of your friends to the garage and pick unique characters to compliment your skills. Together you can seek for rare parts on junkyards, completely rebuild trucks from the frame up or race each other. Take advantage of your spray gun and create liquid awesomeness. Finish the truck with our custom decals or make ones yourself, to add your unique touch! Don't forget to share your best photos on Social Media. Let the world see your magnum opus! Scavenge junkyards to find rare parts or send your buddies for the hunt. When you seek for car parts, you can find some old rusty wreckage. Don't get fooled by its look - that decayed frame can become the next Mega Ram Runner. When you finish your build you can sell it, or... give it away to make someone's day truckin' awesome! Put your tuning and driving skills to the test. Tweak your truck's performance to achieve the best results and prove dominance over your opponents when racing against them online. Add whatever you can create, as the game provides modding support. If you daydream about modifying your truck with self-designed tires, the Brothers of the Beard are here to make it happen!",
