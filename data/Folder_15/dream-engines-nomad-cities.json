    "About the game": "Advanced society is long gone, the world is overrun by the Dream Plagues. The only survivors are small nomadic tribes that don’t attract too much attention. And now, the discovery of a long-abandoned project of the ancients lights a new hope - the flight-capable Nomad Cities. Build an industrious flying city Your city’s population and economy form the backbone of your survival. Running out of food or resources can be just as dangerous as meeting a Dream Plague in the wilds. Plan and build automated production lines , and keep your people housed, happy and well fed. Survive until the last moment - then run! Fortify your city and defend it against raids for as long as you can. But even the ancients were unable to withstand the Dream Plagues forever - the longer you stay, the stronger they become. Unlike the ancients, however, you are able to grab your entire city and just fly away when things become too rough. Balance expansion and disposable buildings to be left behind Your city’s area is limited. You’ll have to balance between expensive long-term upgrades to expand your city, and building disposable infrastructure that will be left behind . Carefully choose which buildings you take with you and which you can live without - at least for a while. Find and exploit scarce resources across different biomes Resources are rare, and you’ll need a lot of them to turn your city into a self-sufficient empire. Good thing you can always move to another area when you’ve depleted everything around you. Every biome has an unlimited variety of procedurally generated landing areas , that each have different resources, opportunities, and challenges . Explore the world with a customizable Steambot The wilderness is swarming with Dream Plagues. To explore your surroundings, you directly control a unique Steam-Bot in real time action . You will upgrade, equip and customize that Steam-Bot to your preferred play style. Discover ancient mysteries The world is full of ancient ruins and strange mysteries. As you fly and land in different areas, you will discover these places, exploit them, and uncover their mysteries . (Mysteries &amp; Lore not yet implemented). Research, craft, and upgrade your infrastructure The ancients used advanced Dream-Tech, most of which is now lost to the ages and to the Dream Plagues. In your flying city you will be able to build advanced research facilities and discover some of these secrets - unlocking advanced buildings and new crafting recipes for your Steam-Bot. Upgrades to your infrastructure provide permanent bonuses and abilities to best fit your preferred playstyle. Spend hard-earned upgrade points on your Steam-Bot’s combat prowess and raid enemy nests for precious resources, on your city’s defenses to build an impenetrable fortress, or on your administrative and economic abilities to build a thriving, rich, mega-factory. Carefully manage your fuel and weight Keep a close eye on your city’s weight and fuel reserves . Being stranded at the wrong moment is a sure way to become extinct.",
