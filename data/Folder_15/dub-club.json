    "About the game": "Welcome to Dub Club, a third person multiplayer virtual music venue featuring an in-game live music stream. Live streams include a variety of electronic music genres including but not limited to Mainstage, House, Tech House, Techno, and Dubstep. Customize your character with a wide range of accessories and styles for Dub Club events. Once you're in the club, show off your dance moves with your friends from a large array of dance emotes provided in the player menu. An in-game chat menu allows you to communicate with your friends as you attend live events within the club. Join an existing party or host your own and enjoy live music with players who love house music as much as you do. Are you ready to party? Note: If the in-game live stream is not playing, then the live stream URL needs to be updated. We try to update it as soon as the old URL is no longer valid.",
