    "About the game": "Eggggg is a ridiculous two-button platform game where you propel yourself around using your vomiting superpowers. Gilbert has an extreme allergy to eggs, and eating them will literally make him vomit like a fountain. He escapes from his mean Aunt Doris in order to get to a birthday party, and needs to use his vomiting superpower to survive in a world of angry cyborg chickens... of course. Features: A unique and fun platform runner suitable for both adults and kids 36 hand-crafted levels of vomiting action Awesome and unique visual style by the Spanish illustrators Brosmind. Controls If you're looking for just another normal platformer, this is not it. But if you're looking for a really fun and quirky experience, and enjoy a good challenge - give it a go! The controls are simple to use but hard to master. Once you get the hang of it, they offer really great and accurate control.",
