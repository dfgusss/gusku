    "About the game": "Elette Fragments is a story based beat em up game. You play as Benviolo, the axe wielding star of the play, as he solves the mystery of not just a missing jewel but missing colors in his home town of Lotte. It features a unique storytelling experience using the stage and Elette’s distinct hand drawn paper cut out style of art while not backing down on the actual beat em up style game play. Elette Fragments tells many of the smaller stories from the characters in Elette and their life after the return of Hermielle. With each act, begin to piece together the mysteries that plague the island nation while experiencing fun and new mechanics that bring an old time favorite genre some new and exciting twists. ACT 1 When a strange trader comes to the drab land of Lotte, it isn’t long before the townsfolk find their day to day activities thrown upside down. With the slightest glimpse of a magnificent blue gem, the citizens of Lotte are thrown into a frenzy only to have the gem taken before their very eyes. Our heroes, Benviolo and Mathias Tillington II are paired with the eccentric trader as a deeper plot surrounding the loss of colors from the nation begins to take shape. ACT 2 A musty journal, unfinished research, and a powerful artifact. In the chance to uncover the mysteries surrounding the loss of color from the Nation of Lotte, Juliet stumbles upon notes left by her late mother. All signs point to the mystical Monocle of Mortimer, a gift given to Hermielle, which legend states can control Spectra in untold ways. In what will become a quest that hits close to home, she must unite with an unlikely ally to uncover a hidden truth.",
