    "About the game": "The second game by Windzen, an independent development team based in Texas. -=-=-=- Battle for the Heart of the Disc! Training in a Direx OS HoloRoom paid off! Picking up right where we left him, Entertainment Hero has trained up for an imminent attack on Famicity, his home turf! Invading killer machines have arrived and are lead by a mysterious new character called Master Villain! After the intruders steal Famicity's energy it's up to Hero to make his way through them all and reach the top of Master Villain's tower in the center of Border Garden Zone! Join Entertainment Hero on a challenging journey across his entire world and face impossible odds at every turn. The world transforms around Hero as you explore Primary Skyway, Border Garden, The Master Tower, and more. Who is Master Villain? What does he want with Famicity's energy? Is this situation really as simple as it seems? -=-=-=- Conquer Eleven Stages Full of Unique Enemies and Obstacles! Confront All Nine Exciting Boss Battles Leading to the Final Boss! Find Secret Power-Ups and Additional Weapons to Help You on Your Way! -=-=-=- Windzen is a two-man team, with brothers Nathan and Jeremy Hathcock. We want to give others the same gift that developers from across the world have given us. Every art asset in Entertainment Hero 2 is drawn by hand and made from scratch. Like the first game, it's a little rough around the edges but it was a learning process and a labor of love. We hope you enjoy it! Entertainment Hero 2 is powered by Unity and made possible with Corgi Engine, an awesome creation by More Mountains. More information about More Mountains and Corgi Engine can be found at their website! Corgi Engine is a fantastic Unity asset for building games, especially for those like us here at Windzen with little or no programming experience. If you've always wanted to build games but don't know where to start Corgi Engine is the way to go!",
