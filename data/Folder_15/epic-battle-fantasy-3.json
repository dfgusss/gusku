    "Release date": "Sep 1, 2016",
    "About the game": "Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is a silly turn-based JRPG, full of useless NPCs, rabid cats, childish humor, unreasonably large weapons, anime boobs, and other nonsense. It's a hefty adventure with over 10 hours of content and hundreds of items to collect. Epic Battle Fantasy 3 is completely free, but if you enjoy it, please consider buying the sequels and spinoff games!",
