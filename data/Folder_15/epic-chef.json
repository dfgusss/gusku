    "About the game": "Epic Chef is a story-driven adventure game flavoured with life-sim farming, and crafting elements, blended together into one delicious dish via an interactive cooking experience - all served with a side of humour and elaborate cast of characters inspired by classics such as Mister Ajikko, or the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett. Grab your spatula and start on your journey to become... Epic Chef! In Epic Chef you will combine ingredients, stirring and tossing with culinary precision to bring out the flavour elements of Vigor, Sophistication and Spirit in your dishes. This forms the core of the cooking experience that you must master in order to become the very best chef in Ambrosia. Dish synergy and ingredient properties combine with a dynamic recipe creation system, meaning that you can experiment with thousands of different combinations to create a unique menu of decadent delights. Serving Rats with Tomatoes and Potatoes? Don't you mean Tomato Soufflé and Vermin Slices in Starchy Cream?! Take on bitter rival chefs in epic culinary clashes to see who is crowned cooking king of Ambrosia! Dishes are scored on a variety of things from ingredients, to flavours, strength and more, with no two judges having the same taste. Become an even greater chef by utilising the addition of sauces to alter the properties of your dishes and influence the judges to win their favour. Live off your land by growing foods such as fruit and vegetables, gather resources to craft specialised machinery that can process your ingredients further, and even create new recipe components whilst you tend to an eclectic mix of animal livestock from cows to unicorns! And don't forget to repair and customise your dilapidated (and slightly haunted) villa! Welcome to Ambrosia, a place of gastronomic delight and agriculture wonder, renowned the world over. You are free to explore all that Ambrosia has to offer, from winding narrow streets to lush green fields, from quaint restaurants to bustling taverns, all full to the brim with 'friendly' locals eager to meet you.",
