    "About the game": "With no humans in sight, the cats are bored—and you know what that means? That’s right. It’s time to tussle! Pounce, hiss, flail, and claw your way through the kitty kingdom to prove your wobbly cat “is best cat.” Fisti-Fluffs is an adorable (and yes, ridiculous) physics-based party game where you tussle with other cats and destroy the environments in frenetic over-the-top battles. Of course, you can play alone, but it’s even better with friends. So get your claws out and prepare for some kitty carnage. GAME FEATURES Fast-paced physics-based cat tussling fun while the owners are away Up to four players can duke it out in smooth and hilarious brawls New fish power-ups give your cat the ability to shoot fireballs or freeze your opponent to the core. Game modes: Tussle, Crown Control, Destruction, Party, and Kibble Defense In Kibble Defense, you and up to 3 of your best friends fend off rats and other critters from stealing your kibble in this endless wave based game mode. 6 fully destructible, fun, exciting, and colorful stages to bust up + the additional, only playable in Kibble Defense, the largest and most comprehensive house stage Turn the playroom into a weapon—smack objects to launch them across environments An adorable roster of real life cats digitized to play as.
