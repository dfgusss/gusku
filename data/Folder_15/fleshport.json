    "About the game": "Introducing, Zentient's First Game Alone and lost, a young girl navigates a predatory world where human flesh is a commodity and outsiders are on the menu. Guide our heroine, The Missing Piece, through puzzles, flee from cannibalistic citizens, and discover the various secrets hidden amid the rubble of a once normal town. ﻿ What's On The Menu (Features) Name your pet fish and never see him again. Run and hide from threats that will actively search in different rooms for you. Solve riddles and puzzles inspired by classic horror game titles. Collect teeth. Explore a gritty dystopia in a semi-open world. Order a 'Sirburger' or 'Mamburger' at a questionable fast food restaurant. Chat with unhinged characters that have accepted their immoral lifestyle. Go vegan by consuming nothing but soft drinks, or survive by committing cannibalism. Meet the Magnanimous, Multidimensional, and Metaphysical Pugly. Make decisions that will alter the outcome of your adventure. Encounter small, friendly bugs that won't impede your experience too much. Play the game again with extras, such as new outfits and cheeky dialogue. ﻿ History Development on Fleshport officially started in March of 2016. It began as a small passion project as a means to bring myself out of a slump in my life, and it graduated into something far more ambitious than I intended. It's been a long road, and although I hope to keep my next adventure a lot shorter, I feel everything I've learned made it time well spent. I hope you enjoy my creation, I look forward to sharing my worlds with you.",
