    "About the game": "Towards the end of the 21st century, the effects of climate change have devastated the world and a military force called “The Collective” has spread across the globe. As part of the resistance group it’s time for you to join the fight! Customize your unique faction in a new take on real-time strategy as you fight in a variety of skirmish, solo, and multiplayer battles. You are not only a commander, but also an engineer – so you have ultimate control over your faction’s units, factories, superweapons and economy. Manage, customize, and develop the blueprints of your emerging faction to create ever-evolving factories and units. Between missions a deep tech tree unlocks components that you’ll use to design combat units. As more technology is unlocked, your designs become more advanced and powerful. Using resources gained in battle, you’ll unlock new options through the metagame Tech Tree to choose the archetype, armour, locomotor, weapons, and special abilities such as stealth and regeneration that will make your faction one of a kind. Ultimately, you will have access to the most powerful options, including an array of deadly superweapons to launch against your foes. Forge your Faction Modify everything from your units to your HQ and super weapons. Choose from a host of weapons, support and locomotor types. Add regenerative armour to your light vehicle or add an anti-tank gun to your aircraft. Save your unique factions adapting them to every situation, and every opponent. Improvise, adapt, overcome! Persistent Tech tree Each battle you win, in each mode, contributes towards your faction’s technology upgrades with different science paths; with over 60 attachments along 4 tiers to unlock, the combinations of equipment and options for field supremacy are almost endless!
