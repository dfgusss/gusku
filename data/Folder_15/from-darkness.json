    "About the game": "NOTE : From Darkness is still in development. Buying it means you'll help grow the game but take note that some features might change or won't be available in the final release. From the darkness of the forest, bandits and looters will aim to destroy your way of life and demolish your livelihood. With the help of vagabonds and villagers, build a thriving town, raise an army and defend your home. Each night brings with it more enemies, so be sure to keep up. From Darkness captures the fun of 2D side-scrolling gameplay. It leverages the thrill of developing your town against the clock with the possibilty of impending doom. FEATURES Recruit villagers to generate income which is used to expand and upgrade your town. Convert vagabonds from camps beyond the town border. They'll join your cause and become villagers to help with daily tasks. Choose wisely which facilities to build: Inn, Hospital, Barracks, Archery, Bank, Farms - each with its own perks. But beware, there is limited space available in the forest. The route you take might increase your numbers but leave your soldiers weak. You control a single character to exercise your wisdom. NPCs take on the roles you give them and fulfil certain duties during daytime, while soldiers protect the town border during the night. Enemies attack your town at night. If you cannot defend it, they'll head for your Town Center and try to destroy it. If they succeed, the game is over. Three different biomes/environments confer different benefits to your town. Beautiful 2D high-definition scenery and day-night cycles.",
