    "About the game": "All you have to do in this game is get your boat in the air and rotate it to make score. The goal is to try to get the highest score! There's also a simple set of challenges included with the game to get you started and interested if you need bite sized goals set by the developer (me). After that it's entirely on you, the player, to make your own goal of making a high score in the default mode, or to beat the challenge list as fast as possible, etc. Features: 10 hand-crafted challenges. A singular ship. Ability to rotate on all 6 axes. Combos. Score modifier pickupables. Dragon curve fractal skybox. Lastly, this game was written entirely from scratch. In other words, I haven't used any pre-made game engine so the large majority of every line of assembly code that's ran is ran with love :)",
