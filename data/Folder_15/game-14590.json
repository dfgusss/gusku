The game is inspired by works such as 'Tsuro', 'Carcassonne', 'Night of Full Moon' and 'Slay the Spire'. We are trying to create a new card game with oriental elements of gameplay. The inspiration of the story 'Tale of Jade/ Li Guang' came from the remains of the Yaoshan altar of the Liangzhu culture in China. There are twelve tombs at the Yaoshan site, and based on this background, we created a story and name 12 ritual rooms by Twelve Branches, The Twelve Branches are the traditional Chinese concept of timekeeping. At the same time, in the traditional concept, the Twelve Branches also related to the internal organs. The two concepts corresponding to the Twelves Branches will influence the development of the plot in the game ......
