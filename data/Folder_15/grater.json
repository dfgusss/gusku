It needs to overcome enemies, solve riddles and collect items, that grants upgrades and new tools: Use a laser gun to defeat foes, clear blocks in your way or interact with switches that are otherwise out of your range. Move special magnetic objects to open new paths or protect yourself through clever positioning. Freeze time and plan ahead to defeat multiple enemies at once or reach distant platforms.",
