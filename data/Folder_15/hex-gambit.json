    "About the game": "Features Diligently balanced for 1v1 or 2v2 competitive play. 21 loadout combinations out of the box, times 6 unlockable captains Tackle our single player challenge: the Blitz Royale Join a faction in our community-wide turf war: the Apex Cup Earn trophies and rack up wins in your quest to become a Grand Master Transition seamlessly between real-time and asynchronous play online   Get Competitive. Be Creative. Hex Gambit is a short form, competitive strategy game that lets players surprise each other in plain sight. It's designed to be as fun to watch as it is to play. Characters jump across the board like checkers pieces, and their moves compliment each other for bold, game-changing plays. Your strongest abilities unlock automatically as your score increases, so each match is a race to unleash a game-winning gambit. Battles take around 15 minutes for experienced players. Jump Over Anyone Our checkers-inspired movement mechanic, called crowdsurfing, makes getting around the board a fun puzzle in and of itself. Bounce over the head of any neighboring unit to land on the opposite side, and that’s chainable if a bunch of characters are standing in a line. What would be a traffic jam in most TBS games is a wealth of options in Hex Gambit. Choose Your Squad Before each match, you’ll select a squad of 5 minion classes and a captain, who provides a unique Ultimate to help you out of tough situations. There are 7 diverse minion classes to choose from: Soldier, Sniper, Brute, Runner, Pacifist, Defender, and Motivator. That's 21 different team combinations, times 6 captains. Easy to Learn, Difficult to Master A quick setup phase skips right to the good stuff: arrange some starter minions however you like on your side of the map. Victory Points are awarded for minion kills, and for each time you can “tap” a crystal pillar on the hostile side of the map. First to 10VP wins. Single-Player Survival Challenge Players looking for some practice can take on a single player gauntlet called the Blitz Royale. It has three difficulties to choose from. Your minion army is persistent across six grueling battles, with reinforcements shuffled and doled out randomly before each match. Every minion you lose is gone for good! League Play - A Community Turf War The heart of Hex Gambit is our competitive league play, the Apex Cup. Each month, all of our players choose a faction and face off in a massive war for control of the Summit. Victory Points you earn in league matches, win or lose, help your team seize territory. Trophies are awarded to all members of the winning faction each season, and to the top performers on each team.",
