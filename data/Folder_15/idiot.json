    "About the game": "You are an ordinary citizen of Yaissor working remotely in the quality department of one of the state corporations in the leisure sector. You will have access to: A mailbox that constantly receives spam. A computer for earning planets by passing mini-games. Post and boat berths for receiving parcels and assembling the boat. Vending machine to listen to the murmur of sparkling water. A broken payphone from which you cannot reach anywhere. An empatoscope that will send you to other spaces to 'merge' with the virtual world. Seasons switch to choose between summer and fall at any given time. Breaker trees to raise your FPS. A flush tank to flush... Okay, that's unnecessary. All life, like that of millions of other citizens, takes place on an island surrounded by water, outside of which you have never been. It is surrounded by impenetrable fog, and all means of movement on water are suppressed by the authorities, referring to the unfavorable situation in the country. You have everything you need for a comfortable life. On the island, a static sun shines every day, and night falls exactly when you go to bed. You get food from a special printer that synthesizes any desired product using food cartridges arriving by mail. And most importantly, do not leave your island, because the enemies of happiness are behind it! This is always reminded by the state, which has never been wrong.",
