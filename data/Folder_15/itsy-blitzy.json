    "About the game": "In this hybrid bullet hell / beat 'em up, you'll have to find ways to constantly close the distance to your enemies to use your melee attacks. Fortunately, you have an absurdly overpowered dash move and a stun cannon to help you out. - Fast paced and satisfying combat - Campaign Mode features 30 levels with varied enemy encounters (and a few bosses...) - See how long you can survive against endless waves of enemies in multiple Infinite modes - Intense difficulty that forces you to turn off your brain and meditate - No time wasted on that 'story' nonsense. We both know you don't care what political-romantic intrigue caused this state of affairs. While most top-down arcade shooters have you running away from enemies while shooting towards them, Itsy Blitzy is all about closing the distance to your enemies as quickly as possible.",
