    "Release date": "Dec 5, 2017",
    "About the game": "Play drums, Harp, and many more in this fun musical App for all ages! Jam Session VR is the exact opposite of most music/rhythm games. There are no notes you are expected to play, and no audience waiting to 'boo' you for a bad performance. Instead, find yourself surrounded by a plethora of different instruments, from drum set, to harp, to theremin, to timpani drums. You'll also find an intuitive touch based sequencer to add full band orchestration with a few touches of a few buttons. Relax in a beautiful meadow and play around on a lovely harp, or rain destruction from the skies as the drumming God of Thunder!",
