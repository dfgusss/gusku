    "About the game": "The junk is alive and it's not friendly. You find yourself stuck in a sinkhole in the middle of some backwoods junkyard and things are far from normal. Everything in this hole has telekinetic abilities. Including you. Use your new found powers to defend yourself and fight back against wave after wave of toasters, vacuums, televisions, and more. This game currently supports SteamVR/HTC Vive and is under continued development to improve the experience. You're abilities consist of 3 main spells (Telekinetic Throw, Junk Shield, and Force Push) and 4 special spells (Time Warp, Shockwave, Cluster Luck, and a Black Hole). Taking out enemies fills your star meter. Each special costs 1 to 4 stars to cast.",
