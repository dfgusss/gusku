    "About the game": "'Just a Game' is a science fiction theme flying shooting game.In the game, you will control the robot protagonist Zero and lead your companions to survive in a world that excludes artificial intelligence. More options : You'll have multiple choices, each of which will lead to different outcomes, including the fate of your friends and the death of them. Multiple teams, multiple choices : In this world, there are multiple factions, and the styles of these factions are different, the personalities of their leaders are different, and the rewards for joining different camps are different. Naturally, you should also help these camps to take over the whole world. However, be careful, some tasks can make you and the camp you join become antagonistic.Of course, you can stand on your own two feet and lead your own fleet to fight the world, or just be a businessman. The colorful world : There are over a dozen different types of ships in the game, dozens or hundreds of space stations, hundreds of NPC with their own unique dialogues, and some of them give you extra missions. In the game there are merchants, mercenaries, interstellar vagabonders, cosmic bandits and so on, as well as surviving ARTIFICIAL intelligence. The things sold by different units are random, and the prices are also random. Maybe you can make a small profit from this. When a space station in the game is captured by a faction, it becomes the territory of that faction and begins to produce troops belonging to that faction. Slightly hardcore Settings : When the protagonist group of the spaceship is destroyed after the game will directly end, must protect the protagonist group of the spaceship. Multiple combat : Not only can you lead your fleet, but you can also lead your ground forces into the enemy's space station or ship to defeat the enemy from within.",
