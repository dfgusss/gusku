    "About the game": "• Take on the challenge Legend of Radiance is greatly inspired by the Souls and Legend of Zelda series. The game is set up around taking on difficult challenges and overcoming them by skill and improvement! • Stylized 3D graphics The game uses a render method called 'sprite stacking' to achieve a unique 2.5D effect with pixel art. This creates a convincing 3D space with a free camera for a look that no other game has! • Start your own adventure The world is open and nonlinear! Go where you want on your adventure and decide which areas and enemies you want to discover first! The world design is inspired by the original Legend of Zelda(NES) , so freedom, exploration, and secrets are abundant! • Place legendary Life Stones to progress Magical Life Stones which function as 'bonfires' from the Souls games, can be placed where you like. They help cut a path through the darkness to reach your next destination! Be careful though, as Life Stones are very rare! • Survive the darkness You are a radiant being which needs light! Keep an eye out for light sources or bring one with you. If you go without light for too long you will die! • Improve your character with a variety of items, upgrades, and souls Collect souls from defeating challenging enemies or buying them from merchants to level up. Equip yourself with unique items you acquire in dungeons to maximize your build! You will need everything you can get to take on the unforgiving world! • Random generation will make each adventure unique Which dungeons you find where will differ with each game, making each playthrough different! This encourages exploration instead of relying on set locations for items and bosses. Finding unique items early can make for interesting character builds too!",
