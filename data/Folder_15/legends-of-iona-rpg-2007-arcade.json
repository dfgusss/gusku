    "About the game": "Play as Zaak, a young man trapped in an ancient underground world . He must face many dangers in order to escape. However, during his adventures, Zaak will awaken a past long-lost forgotten… Before You Rate the Game, Please Read: This is a late publishing of a 2006-2007 arcade video game afterwards, adapted for the Windows PC keyboard and controllers. This is why the controls and camera might seem different from standard games. The game was built by passionate fans of Phantasy Star (1987 Sega (c)) and volunteers. Ok, now let's have fun and play! To Start: Talk to the first guard to start your quests. There is a button (lower right) for the list of QUESTS to do. This game is aimed at quests and discovery, not complicated battle systems. If you like battles, for more information, turn on the BATTLELOG. You must play at least dungeon 3/5 to unlock all special attacks. Features: 5 giant levels filled with dungeons, treasures, monsters and open spaces with a lot of important characters to meet and help through enjoyable quests. Story-line, species, and characters are well-developed serves as foretold of the upcoming MMO Worlds Of Iona. The atmosphere of this game takes the best gameplay seen in RPG's from the '80s and '90s merged with modern gameplay and wide areas. Different gameplay: traditional spells and skills gameplay is now combinations of Ionix crystals and special armor and weapons crafting. Unlock 3 special attack combo moves. Similar to old school RPG's, this game is an average 30+ hours of gameplay. There is no blood/gore in this game. We were on the verge of upgrading the 3C: camera, control and a new and better animated character, but development was on hold with this version of the game with Unity3D. Maybe we will remake this game better completely in Unreal at a later time. Nevertheless, it is a very good indie game, enjoy! :-)",
