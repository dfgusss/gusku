    "About the game": "Everything here is so different. A bit scary, but... we’ll get used to it, right? Your normal life burns and falls apart around you. You toss your favourite mug and a book into your bag and embark on a quest, a search for a place where you can be found once more. The tower of concrete and glass claws at the skies, city hums, neon light shines bright even at night. Light is everywhere, there is plenty of light, and the shadows of this place are vicious and dark. Do they belong here? Or did you bring them with you? People tend to forget. I didn’t. Neither did you, I guess. Lifesigns is a visual novel about people who moved to the City, seeking change and a better life. Would that be enough to free themselves from their past? The game features: the third and final journey deep into the mirror corridor; multiple protagonists; choices and consequences to be made; KITTIES! adult content; loneliness, changes and hope.",
