During the summer of 1930, Lola is sent to live with her Uncle Manolo and his energetic pug Paquita in the charming city of Madrid. Twenty years later, we join Lola after her estranged Uncle is declared dead and she is tasked with sorting through the apartment he left behind. What happened that fateful summer? Dig into Lola’s memories to pick up her uncle's shadowy trail and attempt to piece together the puzzles of the past. Madrid Noir - 'A MYSTERY TWENTY YEARS IN THE MAKING' FEATURES: A lighthearted narrative VR experience with interactivity, shareable with the whole family! PIXAR-like animation by a renowned team, directed by James Castillo, character designer behind family-favorite films such as The Mitchells vs. the Machines and Sherlock Gnomes. Clues, easter eggs, and a world of details hidden in the animated background - watch again to learn more about Lola, Paquita, and the rich culture of Madrid, Spain. A 45 minute adventure with an intermission dividing the two acts, so you can watch it all in one sitting, or take a break in between. Made in Unreal Engine, Madrid Noir is staged as a charming theatre production!
