About the Team This game was made in a short period of time during lockdown by a passionate team made of two developers and a musician. We wanted to touch the essence of what makes a puzzle hard, try to tease players' brain with levels that encourage intentional problem solving and do all of that with a simple set of rules. If you find some levels difficult, tell yourself that our dear AI-solver-assistant sometimes required several seconds to find a solution! We're only just humans after all... Anyways, have fun and tell us what you thought of the game! - Crafty Weazel -",
