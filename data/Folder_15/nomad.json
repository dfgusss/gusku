    "About the game": "Shoot your way through the sands and catch as many chickens as you can. Why? Because you get to keep any gold you find for yourself! Be warned though, the locals are out in force and don't want you getting your hands on those chickens... Catch as many as you can before you succumb to the inevitable, in this challenging perma-death shoot-em-up. Smart and Challenging Enemies They won't be completing your homework, but at least they aren't committing some sort of digital seppuku! The game will test your skill rather than just fill your screen with enemies. Perks/Abilities Many hours were spent implementing and balancing them all, but we all know that you'll probably just stick with a couple you like. Stylish Pixel Graphics Low-res retro stylings - some would say no indie-game is complete without it - but with a contemporary procedurally animated twist. We're living in the future now! Unlocks and Character Customisation These are all technically free... but i will gladly send you my bank details if you wish for a more complete gaming experience.",
