    "About the game": "The kingdom has been invaded by magical ooze crawling out of the volcanoes. Strategist, can we count on you? This slime steals our food and uses it to breed. You get various units. Tell them what to do and save our islands! Later on there will be also enemy soldiers arriving on ships. They will attack your units and the fences. You will need to plan your strategy carefully. Learn to control your soldiers and use the terrain to your advantage. You will be busy, but isn't it worth it to be victorious, and become immortal through the stories told by our people? Oh Lord! It is worth it!!! Enjoy freedom of movement in full 3D with no fixed paths in this tower defense with RTS elements. Your units are your towers and you can build fences anywhere. Set your units' behavior like: how far they can move or who to attack first and create a perfect team to defend against slimy ooze coming out of the volcanoes as well as the enemy units arriving on ships. Last 13th level is endless, so you can keep on improving and competing on a leader board forever! Another leader board is for the combined score of the 12 levels. There are only two resources: wood for fences and food. There are no upgrades for units and the game is very easy to start, but over time with many various units there are many ways to win. After completing the game keep on improving your scores inventing new strategies and challenging other players. ------------------------------ Tips on how to start playing: - Fences have to be built by slowly dragging the mouse pointer while mouse button is pressed. Do not block the path to the food storage's entrance or the ooze will destroy the fence. Do not build too close to the entrance. Watch the black path of the ooze changing while you build. - Your units will attack the closest enemy in range by default or you can select one to chase and kill or from the second level you can set for each of your units, which type of enemy to attack first. Have fun defending the islands! ------------------------------ Support small indie experimental projects, if you want to see more interesting, experimental games.
