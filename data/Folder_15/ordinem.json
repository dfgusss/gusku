    "About the game": "They take over the railing system in Ordinem. Your objective is simple: match the ware to the right colors. Manage one or more rails and match the ware to the right colors. Remember: no ware should pass and matching the wrong color means losing score. Your objective is simple but tough. You can use the rails with button [1] to [3]. It's only important that the right color is moved over the right field and you push the right button at the right time. If the wrong color should pass, not a problem, you have three lives. If three wrong ware are collected, it's game over and you collect your score. Hint: Don't complicate things, three rails can be confusing. Keep an eye on the whole map and work foresighted. You can unlock new maps with points, that get more difficult and represent new situations. If the standard modes are too easy, try the modes [Inverted Ways] or [Random Maps], where the normal rules don't apply.",
