    "About the game": "Outskirts is a colorful 360° bullet-hell with beautiful vector based art, interactive music and a deep combo system. Drive your ship through your foes and make your path to the leaderboard! Outskirts throws you in a circular and enemy-flooded board. Unlike other well-known shoot ‘em ups, there’s no scrolling in the game, everything evolves around the center of the screen. Three colors are dominating the battlefield: wear one of them to be immuned against bullets of the same element. Switch between them and put down your foes to gain power and unleash powerful weapons. Killing enemies in the proper order will make you achieve a combo and gain bonus points or bonus score multiplier. You can also do a combo of combos, which will unlock a true hidden power. Play with the depth of the map to manage waves of enemies. Circular battlefield. A colour system to absorb enemy bullets and optimize your damages. Deep and rewarding combo system. Interactive music. Addictive. No randomness. Easy to play, hard to master.",
