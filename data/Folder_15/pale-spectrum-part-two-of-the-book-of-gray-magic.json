    "About the game": "Knowledge of Brilliant Shadows - Part One of the Book of Gray Magic is not required to enjoy and understand Part Two, but Pale Spectrum does contain spoilers for Part One. There are seven magics, five more than have ever been explored, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. The kobolds, once a beast of myth, have forged an alliance with Celeste. A mad demigod rages across the land, aiming to end the tyranny of monarchies with Celeste in his sights. Meanwhile, a magical talking sword is busy preparing the misfit mages of the Ryuusian Royal Cabal for a clash against an arcane foe from distant lands of fable. You know, normal things. One thing is certain, no threat the cabal faces compares to their greatest challenge: relationships, love, and family troubles. Pale Spectrum is the sequel to Brilliant Shadows, and both are adventures from the Book of Gray Magic. Follow along with Necromancers, Paladins, Witches, and Changelings in this story of intrigue, mystery and magic.
