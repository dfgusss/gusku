GAMEPLAY: phoToq is a single player psychological horror where you need to take pictures of paranormal events in a haunted house. Every run generates new goals at random.

High immersion with sound elements happening all the time, keeping the player alert and fearful. Dark and tense atmosphere with constant paranormal events happening around you. You must quickly hide from the ghost when attacked to continue your objective. Capture paranormal evidence and beware of the ghost. High replay factor with random generated objectives on each new run.",
