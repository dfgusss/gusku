    "About the game": "What does it take to be in a parade? Hard work, a bright shiny chassis and a little help from your friends. That's what Putt-Putt® discovers as he gears up to join the annual Cartown Pet Parade. Children will be delighted as they meet the local carfolk, explore a toy shop, tool down the road and more. Along the way, they learn to think ahead, deal with unexpected problems, and give others a hand. The road to discovery has never been more fun - or more educational. Charming talking characters, lively sound effects and lifelike animation keep your child focused on the adventure. Putt-Putt® Joins the Parade is fully-loaded with originality and activity. Even adults find it hard to resist getting in on the fun. What's more, Putt-Putt® offers lots of exciting new options every time kids play. The result is an entertaining learning experience that never gets old. Surprise Click Points. There's no telling what will pop up when you click on a garage door, a magnet or even a flower. Talking fire engines and dancing mice are just some of Putt-Putt's® many roadside attractions. With so much to see, kids won't want to miss a thing. Need Help? Just See Smokey. Smokey's always there to give Putt-Putt® a hand. Help screens have never been friendlier. Clean Up's a Breeze. Kids help Putt-Putt® get cleaned up for the parade with a simple click of the mouse. Taking a shower is more fun than ever. Moo-ve Over. Children's problem-solving skills are developed as they learn how to deal with cow roadblocks and other unexpected problems. Putt-Putt® Opens Up a Helpful New World. Kids learn how to earn money and remember an address. They even learn the value of doing a good deed.
