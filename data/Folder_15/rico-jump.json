    "About the game": "Welcome to Rico-Jump! Rico-Jump is a single-/multiplayer 3D-Platform racer, where you try to beat the leaderboard by skillfully maneuvering through a futuristic obstacle course. The movement mechanics are similar to the popular e-Sport title 'Counter-Strike' and should therefore be familiar to most people. The concept of using the jump-pads and maneuvering mid-air is easy to learn, but be assured, it is hard to master. A map editor offers the possibilities to create your own Rico-Jump courses to challange your friends and the world. Additionally, it offers 3 extra game modes, where you are able to throw balls at one another trying push other people off their platforms. This is implemented as a Deathmatch-Mode as well as a Battle Royal-mode, with falling platforms. The third game mode is a coop-based team-game. This game is in early 'Early Access' as I am developing it besides my full-time job as a hobby. So expect some bugs and unpolished UI. I hope you enjoy it and feel free to hit me up with your opinions and suggestions. :) Current Features Jump through existing or self-made obstacle courses Global leaderboards (challange your friends high-scores!) Multiplayer! Chat Map editor Very ugly hats to put on your robot!!",
