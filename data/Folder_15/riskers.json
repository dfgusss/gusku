    "About the game": "What would you do if you found a briefcase filled with money? In Riskers, garbage man Rick chooses to keep the money for himself – and becomes the target of powerful (and dangerous!) mobsters in the process. Help Rick stay alive as he races, shoots, fights – and even throws chairs! – in this top-down, open-world shooter. Want to keep breathing? Eliminate enemies efficiently and steal cars to stay one step ahead of your pursuers. With the freedom to progress straight through the main story or complete a variety of side missions, you can experience a life of crime in any way you see fit in Riskers. Think you have what it takes to survive? Experience an interactive open world, complete with a day and night cycle. Explore highly detailed interior levels. Play a unique mix of game genres (top-down action, driving, and shooting). Eliminate enemies with a selection of eight different weapons, or resort to chair-throwing. Take a break from the main story and complete a variety of side missions. Immerse yourself in the story through comic book-style cutscenes. Search for in-game collectibles! /",
