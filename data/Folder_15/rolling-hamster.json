    "About the game": "Are you ready for a revolution in the world of party-games ? Here comes Rolling Hamster the world's first arcade racing game with a local twist : it only uses one button. There's no need to learn the controls ! Just pick a button ! FOUR PLAYER MAYHEM You love playing with friends but are short on gamepads ? No problem ! With Rolling Hamster chances are you already have everything you need at hand since a single keyboard is more than enough for four players. NO NEED FOR SPLIT-SCREEN Inspired by top-down racers from yesteryear Rolling Hamster offers a clean and legible playing field that avoids the excesses of split-screen gaming. With its smooth camera and color-coded contestants it's a breeze to follow your Hamster wherever you are ! THEY SEE ME ROLLIN', THEY HATIN' Can't finesse your way to the top spot ? No biggie : just smash through. Each Rolling Hamster is equipped with a sturdy shock-proof ball that can withstand any impact. Which is sure to come in handy when you'll be smashing your way towards the finish line. But beware. Of course there is a penalty for falling. Being cute ? That doesn't help at all when gravity comes knocking. TRACKS FOR MILES Rolling Hamster's not just happy to provide you with just that one free track and let you pay your way towards a full game. Nuh-huh. We've got tracks for miles. Literally. Three, count 'em, three popping world to race in fifteen different tracks. But that's not all... we'll be providing more courses as time goes on. It's our way of saying thanks. CUTE AND COLORFUL Rolling Hamster's kinda one of the cutest and most colorful games you'll comme across. Each pixel has been hand-tinted by our experts with all-natural ingredients to ensure the level of lush vibrance you've come to expect of modern video games. That's our Rolling Hamster promise.",
