    "About the game": "Follow the Sin Bearers' adventures, a mercenary group evolving in a fictive near future on Earth, through the 24 maps of this old school tactical game. During each map you will select up to 7 units between the 10 different characters with their own strengths and abilities and try to achieve the mission objectives. Each fight will grant experience points to your unit than will then evolve and get new capacities. You can choose between 2 game modes, user based where you will play your whole team at once before the enemies do the same, or the mode initiative based, where the order of the unit to play will depends on their own stats. This has to be chosen when starting new game and cannot be changed afterward.",
