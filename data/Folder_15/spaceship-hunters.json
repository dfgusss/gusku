    "About the game": "Spaceship Hunters is a chaotic couch co-op shoot-em-up for 4 players. Working as a crew, fight your way through the worst criminals the universe has to offer. Only through teamwork and a little bit of luck can you spread law and order in the universe. Never forget, space is a deadly place full of worthy opponents. You cannot face them alone! LOCAL CO-OP GAMEPLAY 4 players (or less players plus an extremely dumb AI) need to work together to man the Spaceship Hunter. As part of the crew each player will enjoy one of the following roles. Pilot: The ace controls the ship's movements and must keep a cool head to avoid incoming attacks. Gunner: The hothead controls all the weapons and it’s often better to fire without aiming than aiming without firing. Engineer: The brain of the operation protects the ship with the shield while preparing the best tools to handle the situation. Comms: The tactician can move objects with the tractor beam while hindering opponent ships by hacking them. All players fill a crucial role at all times. Dangerous challenging universe The game contains many unique opponents which can be challenging to any untrained crew. You will need to observe them carefully and use every tool at your disposal to triumph. Many gameplay options are available to cater the experience to your specific crew.",
