The game’s scenario includes themes of polyamory and genderfluid/non-binary identities on two layers. One story takes place in the metanarrative of the Spitkissers, the other in the hand-drawn tale of Ymer, whose body is represented as the playground of this game. &lt;3 Main Features &lt;3 80 levels with replayability challenges A trippy love story told through comics and emojis.
