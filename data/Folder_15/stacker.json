    "Release date": "Dec 4, 2017",
    "About the game": "Stacker is a throwback to old arcade twin stick shooters, but with a twist. Your shots can stick to walls and damage any enemies that come in contact with them. You can spray n' pray or build up a defense with your shots. You go through waves of enemies and have downtime in between to strategize for the next. Try and survive for as long as possible and get the high score.",
