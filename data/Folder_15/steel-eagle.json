    "About the game": "Steel Eagle is a reference to classic arcade top-down view shooters with a scrolled map. Lead the Steel Eagle safely through 20 levels, destroying as many enemies as possible on the way. At the end of each level there is a landing pad waiting for you, which allows you to move to the next level. Of course, the landing pad is guarded by enemies. Once you reach the landing pad you will be able to exchange the points for additional force and strength of your “Steel Eagle”. Main features: - 20 different levels. - simple vehicle development system, but giving the chance to try different development options. - the ability to unlock the FPS if the standard speed of the game will be too slow for you (test how many frames will take your computer!). Sit at the controls of the “Steel Eagle” and get the most points.",
