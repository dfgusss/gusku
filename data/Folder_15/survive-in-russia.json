    "About the game": "Have you ever thought what is it – life in Russia? What is it like to be a citizen of a typical Russian hinterland? Life outside of major Russian cities is far from the bright and joyful picture of progressive Europe - here there is despondency, melancholy and endless depression You are just a philistine of a simple city in Central Russia. Feel the Russian lifestyle in a place where your only goal is to survive. You are not a criminal authority, official, or law enforcement officer. You are a simple citizen of Russia and simple requests without ambitions Break up a school fight in the yard? Quit your job that makes your blood boil? Spend your entire salary at the online casino? Remember: You have a choice Various characters: • Filatov S. P. -an elderly teacher in a city school. Teaching children is his life's work, but sometimes it seems to him that he has lived his 67 years in vain. He is respected as a senior, but rarely listened to. Sometimes they don't even notice it. He is like a ghost to those who work with him or come to get knowledge from him. He could have retired a long time ago, but how can you spend the rest of your days with dignity on a modest pension? And there will simply be no one to work at the school. • Panko A. A. (Temporarily unavailable) - a young doctor, a promising and intelligent young man. He wanted to help people, but he couldn't help himself. No wife and children. The work takes up all his time. The local city hospital is hell on earth. Widespread corruption and the lack of necessary things in the hospital terrify him. But he is only one part of the system. He can't change anything, and he is slowly being absorbed by this system. To survive on the salary of a simple doctor, he has to do things that are not quite legal from time to time.... New characters are expected to appear in the future. Features: • Realism. Only the realities of the Russian hinterland. Only hardcore. Broken asphalt, low salaries and fear for lives. Depression after the game is guaranteed. • Choice. Live a year in a skin of Russian citizen. Become him. Each of your days will bring you a choice. Do it responsibly. After all, everything has consequences. • Non-linear plot. Depending on your choice, you will find 9 unique endings. • Economy. Get a real cash (joke) for your work and spend it as you want. Just remember – you still need to buy food at a local stall. • Simple mechanics. There is a condition and there is a selection branch. It's simple. Even a bear can understand (from Russia with love) All coincidences with real people are random and events are fictional",
