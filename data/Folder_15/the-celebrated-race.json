    "About the game": "Tom Sawyer, the protagonist who wakes up from a deep sleep, doesn't know where he is. He gradually adapts to the strange village and fights against tyranny with his new partners in the new world. With the progress of the game story, the character level will be higher and higher, and more and more partners will join the player team to make the player stronger. Of course, at the same time, the enemies of each level will also become higher and stronger. It depends on the level of the players. Like other SRPG flag games, players can see the full picture of the battlefield at each level from the perspective of looking down, so as to analyze the strength and layout of both the enemy and us, control our protagonists and teammates to defeat the enemy at each level and finally win. This is a domestic individual independent game. This game is adapted from the novel of the same name 'the legendary race' written by Bai Pang, the game maker. Both the novel and the game are created and produced by myself, paying tribute to the classic SRPG flag game 'the coat of fire' on FC in childhood. The player who buys the game can see the author's email address after customs clearance, and write to my email to get the complete novel, which is free. Yes, buy games and send novels! The content of the novel adapted by the game has been reduced, and the novel is more plentiful and more wonderful!",
