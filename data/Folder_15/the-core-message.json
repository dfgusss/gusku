    "About the game": "A massive undertaking to reach the core of a new galaxy. You and your crew found unknown materials and started to upgrade your ship to become one of the most powerful ever. While harvesting the new core materials you came across something even more unbelievable ... The Core Message . The Core Message has and will change everything for anyone who hears it. Before you could finish the upgrades on you ship, a massive armada of ships appeared on the radar, weapons charging! With a half finished ship, you and your crew barely escaped the galaxy core trying to return to your home world to deliver The Core Message while being hunted by an armada of powerful unknown alien ships. Even though your ship is only half finished, it still possesses some of the most powerful weapon and shield systems ever created by mankind: A weapon only known as the Destabilizer, instantly breaks any known material apart on the subatomic level. A shield that can block any incoming threat of any kind by also breaking the threat apart on the subatomic level. Keep your half finished ship together as system failures, software bugs and computer viruses interfere with your attempt to survive the alien armada and their incoming attacks. Finish retro puzzles to charge your weapon and shields while evading and defeating enemy ships. You will need a set of almost super human skills to survive this impossible mission: Perfect multitasking skills. Synchronized hand-eye coordination. Millisecond reflexes. Excellent peripheral vision. And a lot of luck!",
