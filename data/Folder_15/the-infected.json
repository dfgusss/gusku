    "About the game": "The Infected Lore: A virus was a lot more serious than anticipated, a treatment was looking promising. A drug trial seemed to work, many were getting better and fatality rates were dropping. But somethings not right. DNA is mutating and unexpected side effects are piling up, changing people. We call them Vambies, they seem to look like mix between a vampire and zombie. Well this is what the media is telling us but is that the truth? What The Infected is About: Several friends headed out to a remote part of a forest for a weekend of camping. However, after not returning and no sign of their whereabouts, one of the parents decided to go take a look see at their last known location. What did he find out?

So only support this game if you are willing to bear with us and believe in what we're trying to accomplish. Which is to say that, at the end of this long road ahead, we're going to make a game that is a different take on the whole survival genre.
