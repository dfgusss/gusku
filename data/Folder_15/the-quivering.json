Set in the dark and foreboding village of Warty Hollow, The Quivering follows the fortunes of young Spud, as he tries to save his uncle, Olivetti Franken-Stamp, from the diabolical spell cast upon him by the big cheese from Hell, Big D. Batty old Uncle Olivetti has found a gateway to Dimension X during his recreational chemistry experiments and accidentally opened a doorway for all the foul-smelling ghoulish monstrosities of the netherworld lead by the putrid, slimy and totally evil Big D. We are talking:- werewolves, mummies, ghouls, demons, vampires, zombies, skeletons and swamp monsters. As Spud, you must defeat Big D's dark tyranny and change your uncle back from a raven, simultaneously rescuing the whole world from hell and eternal suffering. Can you take the heat?",
