    "About the game": "Tittilium uses a hand physics system(similar to Surgeon Simulator) to interact with the world, nearly everything is movable, chaos is to be expected! The goal is simple, in the beginning of each session you get a set of tasks, these tasks can consist of changing Abby's clothes(you have to put a specific item on her - but be careful not to accidentally take the clothes off of her, she is.. ehm.. anatomically correct(to help her blend in with humans of course) - so be a gentleman and don't take off that you don't have to!), charging her batteries(you have to find them first though), placing Abby in a certain place(like in the shower), and so on. There is a pretty aggressive timer which you have to take into account, or you'll have to start over with a different set of tasks - absolutely doable, but you have to know what you are doing. And if you had enough of putting clothes on, taking them off, or playing with jiggling things there is a mystery to be solved as well - can't say more about that though, it wouldn't be a mystery otherwise! Features - why do You want to play? Hand Physics which can interact with almost everything(the walls and some of the furniture stays, the rest is game) Realistic breast physics(yes!) Micro skin physics(meaning you can poke her let's say hand, and it will react to it!) Jello physics(this isn't some suggestive thing, I'm talking about actual jello) The game is in the short but sweet territory, it's totally possible to finish it around 20 minutes(hence the super low base price), but this is something I always wanted to do so.. here we go.",
