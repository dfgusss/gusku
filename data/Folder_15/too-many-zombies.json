    "About the game": "Anyway, the world is full of zombies. Nobody knows why this happens and where did it start. So anyone can tell just by looking at it that's at stake. Best is to get out of here. Zombies pounce whenever they hear the sound. But don't worry. The great communicator will help you. Or you have to rake something useful, and then you use this to make something to against zombies. No matter what anyone says, the most important thing is survival. Feature Destroy all the zombies. It's a simple action game that you can enjoy. Craft &amp; Build : You can make something useful(ex. barricade, bandage, trap) by gathering materials to survive. Local multiplayer (up to 4 players) : Enjoy the game with your friends. It might be easy to survive if you have a colleague.",
