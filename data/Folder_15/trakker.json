    "About the game": "Guardians of the digital realms, called TRAKKERS, navigate the maze-like node structures, defending against the insidious, viral intruders out to consume all life. Immerse yourself in this cyber landscape (with synthwave music supplied by Dashcam), defeating enemies and collecting files before escaping through the exit. Is your goal simply to escape, collect files to slow down the attack or become the ultimate hero and save the system completely? That, dear TRAKKER, is up to you to decide. 8 levels, including three difficulty settings, provide an experience suitable for every player's skill level - ranging from engagement to adrenaline-fueled panic.",
