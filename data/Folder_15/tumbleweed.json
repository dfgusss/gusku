    "About the game": "We're bringing to you a fun roguelike twist on the classic tower defense genre. Start the game with random tower loot crates and see what the playthrough brings. You'll never get the same experience twice and with the amount of towers and enhancers, you'll need to use your resources wisely to make it to the end. Place your towers strategically, use your enhancers at the right moments and when all else fails whip out the consumables to decimate the enemies and stop them from reaching your town. FEATURES - 4 Base Tower Heroes - 6 Enhancer Types - 2 Distinct Consumables - 5 Loot Quality Tiers - 35+ Unique Levels - 75+ Talents to Choose From - Tons of Achievements! Unique combinations of towers and enhancers create a fun experience where you're constantly balancing between the instinct to horde your loot and to just use it all and steamroll the baddies. When you die you start from the beginning but you can use your talent points to increase your power and make it further next time! We've poured a lot of thought and care into this game and we hope you have some fun with it! Help our heroes survive the onslaught and achieve victory!",
