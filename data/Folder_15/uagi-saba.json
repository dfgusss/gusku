    "About the game": "What Is Uagi-Saba? Uagi-Saba is a creature care simulator that takes place deep underground. Raise, care for and breed magical beings known as Mystics while harvesting resources, expanding sanctuary and exploring. In-Depth Genetics Uagi-Saba uses a realistic genetics system, every body part has two genes which can be passed on from parents to offspring resulting in thousands of body part combinations. Stats, skin pigment and many other parts of a mystic's DNA also have their own unique genes and can be passed on through breeding. Recessive and dominant genes, resistance to sickness, mutations and the incorporation of 'wild' genetics. It's all possible... Features Raise Raise mystics from egg to adult, feed them, give them water and keep them company. Teach Teach mystics a variety of words to better understand what they are trying to say. Breed Breed your mystics to discover new body parts and genes. Improve stats and traits through selective breeding, create the perfect species. Play In The Gene Pool Find new genes and mutations by breeding multiple generations of mystics. If you are lucky you may even stumble on a wild mystic, breed it with your own to uncover very rare genes. Harvest The Harvest-able Harvest all kinds of resources using special modules, rooms and your mouse pointer. Create a strong economy, expand your sanctuary.

Credits Programming, Art, Animations, Sound FX, and writing by Aaron Arcand Soundtrack By Richard Batchelor Live Developement I live stream Uagi-Saba development daily on Twitch Come on by and tell me what you think. 'A species at the end of it's line encased in a speedy ship, travelling across the stars with a sleeping creature in it's underbelly. Hoping to rekindle the fire, a second chance at life they sped towards the planet to find their sanctuary. But it the end what they found was only the darkness and a slow death. They were playing with very life itself and now they would pay with their own. Sometimes though from death springs new life and something below that cold soil still moves.'
