    "About the game": "Underlings is a game of survival in a ruthless world in which everything is trying to kill you, hunt, gather, farm and build, but most of all, die and try again. You will play as one of the 'evil' creatures of the world, trying to escape your past and live a peaceful life, being forever hunted by the bosses of the underworld. Explore the world of dangerous beasts, gather interesting resources to craft new weapons and armor, build up your base and try to defend it against raids of hell, or fail and have it destroyed as you run away scared and try to rebuild it again. Who will last, you or them...? Features: 4 game modes: Play on sandbox mode if you just want to relax, farm and build and not worry about raids, choose hardcore mode with one life and try to survive for as long as you can, easy or normal mode depending on how much difficulty you desire with balanced gameplay. Challenging gameplay: Theres no hand holding, you will be dropped in the world where danger lurks everywhere, its up to you to survive, doing whatever it takes. 4 Player co-op: Play with your friends, create bases together and defeat hordes of enemies easier. Random generation: Start each game on a completely different randomly generated world, try to find the best place for a base, explore the world and find the resources you need. Survival at its core: Gather resources, find food, craft better weapons and armor, build a base, farm, breed animals and try to defend all of it each day or die trying. No DLC's, ever: You get the game and all of its future updates, give feedback in the forums and I will try to improve it as soon as possible.",
