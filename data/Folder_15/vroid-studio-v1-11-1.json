    "About the game": "VRoid Studio is a 3D character maker that lets you use your imagination to easily create your own original characters. By making your 2D characters able to move in a 3D space and usable in anime and game production, your creative range will greatly expand. The VRoid Project has started with the hope that many creators will have fun exploring the different possibilities of 3D and that this will lead to the creation of many marvelous works, resulting in an increase in the number of creators able to handle 3D. ■ The Strengths of VRoid Studio ・Easy-to-use, intuitive software Face features, body shape, outfits — everything is customizable in infinite ways. Even first-time users can fully enjoy the software by picking preset items and playing around with the parameters’ sliders. ・As easy as drawing on paper Simply draw hair bundles with the pen tool and adjust the parameters to swiftly model your character's hairstyle, and add hair motion thanks to the intuitive bone settings. ・Edit 3D models in real-time Editing outfits, as well as details in the hair or eyes, has never been easier. Users can check in real-time how their edits are affecting the model directly on the texture, with the 3D preview. (You can draw on both the UV mapped textures and your 3D model directly!) This software supports digital pens and is pressure-sensitive. Furthermore, textures and designs can be arranged in different layers, making it easy for experienced designers to work with. ・An abundance of items, ready to use! You can start creating right after download: with many ready-to-use preset items, you won’t need to create anything from scratch. There are hairstyles, make-up, outfits, and many more to pick and mix. Furthermore, these items can all be used in whatever arrangement you want! ・Your models are yours to use freely You can set your own terms of use for the data of every model, texture, item, etc you create on VRoid Studio, specifying if you give permission for commercial use, credits, etc. * When using the data for models created by pixiv or third parties, please be sure to follow the terms of use and licensing conditions.",
