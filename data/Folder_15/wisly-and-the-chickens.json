Wisly and the Chickens presents the comical story of a chicken coop revolt against a fateful group of weasels. The chickens tired of having their eggs stolen decide to put an end to this story and with Galinacio help, they start their deadly search behind the weasels. However, when the weasels learn of the hens' plan, they immediately try to escape, leaving only a single weasel, Wisly. However, what the chickens did not know is that Wisly never agreed with the evil actions of others of his species, feeding only on small fruits from the farm. But when faced with that enraged group of chickens, Wisly has no chance to explain all this, needing literally to RUN for his life! Run for your life and complete the levels to advance! Take on challenging levels and find the best way to complete them and escape from the chickens. Oh sure! Wisly will always be running, since Galinácio does not come out of his tail! Multiple environments, browse all biomes! Face different environments with different movement mechanics. Yes, Wisly can swim, dig and FLY! Craft your devices!
