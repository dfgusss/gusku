    "About the game": "Up to 4 Players Local Coop Over 80 handcrafted levels Single Player Mode Online Leaderboards Full Controller Support (mix and match XBox One, Xbox 360, PS4, and other) Simple Controls (2-'Button'-Game) No Story Twaddle Sit Back and Grab Your Gamepads xDasher is a frantic local coop game about dashing through monsters with the proper colour to get higher combos and scores. This is a game where co-op actually means cooperative, because all players share a health bar and any monster encounter requires every one to do their part. The gameplay is entirely colour coded, meaning each of your team mates can only damage monsters highlighted in their colour. You need to attack monsters alternatingly and within a small time frame to kill them. Thus, xDasher evokes old-school couch co-op feelings, where you start yelling at each other, given the fierce battle against time, the hustle of aligning your tactics and knowing you will only make it as a team. Unique Levels Each stage is hand crafted and each run consists of a number of randomly picked stages. The demo includes a tutorial and three levels. In the full game there are additional boss battles which put your team to the ultimate test. Online Leaderboards In the spirit of arcade competition, your team also fight for the highest score on an online leaderboard. As a team, you increase the score by killing monsters and advancing through the dungeon. Furthermore, each of your team mates can earn special awards to show off their prowess.
