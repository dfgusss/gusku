In 2021 humankind received a distress signal from the far side of the Moon, and immediately sent four brave people to investigate its source. You will be monitoring the astronauts and make decisions that will directly impact the story and the characters. Each choice may lead you closer to - or farther from - the truth. FEATURES Mind-shattering atmosphere, a mix of sci-fi and horror in the veins of Alien and Prometheus, spiced up with the occasional joke Communicate with the astronauts in real time Influence the story by making your own decisions There are multiple endings, including happy ones :) You can rewind the story and make another choice if the mission ends in a disaster What separates this game from other text quests like Lifeline, are the awesome photos that the team sends your way while exploring the source of the signal",
