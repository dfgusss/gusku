    "About the game": "The story of the writer Mike Williams, a specialist in paranormal phenomena, he is sent to the dead city of Centralia to search for inspiration, to finish writing your book on the paranormal. Mike Williams, trying to write a book, being an expert on the paranormal, he himself does not believe in the existence of ghosts, considers this type of activity to be his usual income and nothing else. Another meaningless day Mike began with an Internet browsing, he read about various strange places, in search of inspiration and materials, stumbled upon an article about the dead city of Centralia, he decides to go to this city, as the city bustle did not allow him to finish the book. The whole story begins in Centralia, Pennsylvania. In the middle of the XIX century, here, in the eastern part of the Allegheny Mountains, quite rich reserves of coal were discovered. Its industrial development in Centrailia more or less successfully lasted for about a century and, probably, would have gone so far, if not for the confluence of circumstances, multiplied by human negligence. By the early 1960s, local residents turned the unused pit of one of the surrounding mines into an ordinary city dump. The volunteers who arrived to clean it up in May 1962 did not find anything better than just burning it — a practice that they had once used in Centrelia. A simple operation to arson the garbage was successfully carried out, but with its subsequent extinguishing the situation was more complicated. From the landfill, the fire spread to the coal deposits that remained in the mine, which, as coal is supposed to, began to burn quite successfully, and the fire was constantly spreading through the territory of the already inactive mine workings. Some time after the incident, the state finally paid attention to the scale of the problem and allocated funds for its solution. By this time, the fire had spread so much under Centreilia that the only way out was the complete resettlement of this small town, where about 1 thousand people lived. You will find several endings of the game, and the atmospheric terrible horror. I did not believe in the existence of a poltergeist until today! I really hope that I will see the dawn. P.S Mike. • Atmosphere of horror • Beautiful soundtrack • Modern graphics • Multiple game endings • Puzzle",
