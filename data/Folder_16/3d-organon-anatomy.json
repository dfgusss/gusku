    "About the game": "3D Organon is a multi-award winning self-discovery experience into the human body. You can now visualize the skeletal system, muscles, vessels, nerves, and other organs in 3D. Delve into the human models and see what you are made of. The app features an extensive knowledge-base of anatomical definitions with terminology based on the official Terminologia Anatomica. The Guest mode access in the app is free for everyone and includes all 3D models of the male and female skeletal systems and connective tissues. The animations of joints and bones in the human ‘Actions‘ module are also included. A subscription license grants full access to all body systems, microscopic anatomy, body actions, interactive quizzes, bone mapping, cadaveric images, remote network session creation, and many more features and functions. 3D Organon is used by hundreds of leading universities and hospitals worldwide. It’s been recommended by leading publications reporting on the future of science, education, and medicine, such as Huffington Post, Scimex, SBS, Futurism, and many others. The virtual reality version of 3D Organon has been featured in the keynote speeches by Cher Wang, the chairwoman of HTC, in MWC 2019 and by Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of Facebook, in the OC3 conference. Its educational advantages include gamification of learning owing to the fact that students find the experience stimulating, engaging, and entertaining. The 3D models in 3D Organon can add important cognitive input which enhances the in-depth understanding of key anatomical concepts and retention of knowledge. Game changer multi-user anatomy trainer The ‘Network’ module allows participants to join multi-user online training sessions hosted by educators and institutions. The anatomy trainer enables you to attend remote delivery of anatomy lessons and communicate with your tutor and peers in real-time through voice chat and messages. This new module is cross-platform, setting no barriers to users joining a session via any supported device. All major pc-powered and standalone virtual reality headsets, desktop, tablet, and smartphone platforms are supported. 3D Organon integrates advanced teaching tools that could complement any anatomy curriculum. Educators and healthcare professionals can now visualize and explore anatomy as never before. Who is 3D Organon Anatomy for? The app is designed to suit a wide range of individuals from medical and allied-health students to patients, artists, and curious minds. It helps students grasp the challenging subject of anatomy, but it is also easily understood by laypeople without a medical background. The application delivers accurate visual and textual information, immediate response time and intuitive navigation. It satisfies the highest standards of medical and scientific accuracy. A qualified team of anatomy professors and medical professionals are the authors of the anatomical definitions, formative assessment clinical anatomy quizzes, and clinical correlations in 3D Organon.
