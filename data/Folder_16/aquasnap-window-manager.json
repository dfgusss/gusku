    "About the game": "Too many windows on your screen? Stop wasting your productivity. AquaSnap is a powerful window manager that helps you arrange and organize multiple applications on your desktop with minimum effort. It allows you to achieve maximum multitasking, especially if you own a high-resolution monitor or a multi-monitor setup. Window docking Split your desktop in one easy gesture Drag &amp; Drop your windows to the sides or corners of the screen and they are automatically resized to fit one half or one quarter of the screen. Just like the built-in Aero Snap function of Windows 10 but with more possibilities! This is especially useful on a 4K monitor or on multiple monitors. Window tiling Sometimes, splitting your desktop into halves or quarters is not ideal When two windows are side by side, resizing one of them while pressing [Ctrl] will also resize the other one. It's an easy and powerful way to modify the layout of several tiled windows. Window snapping Don't waste your desktop space, pixels are precious! AquaSnap allows you to easily align your windows by making them behave like magnets. This simple feature is the cornerstone of AquaSnap and has been carefully designed to assist you without getting in your way. Window stretching One click to conquer this free space on your screen! This is another powerful way to quickly split your desktop space between several windows. Double-click on the edge of a window to maximize it in one direction. Do the same while pressing [Shift] to maximize it vertically or horizontally. Move windows together Easily manage these small floating windows Professional applications with complex UI often scatter small toolbox windows on your desktop. Keep them grouped and move them all at once. Move one window while pressing [Ctrl] and the whole group of adjacent windows will follow. Make it stay on top Need to keep an eye on a small window? This is the best way to have this window always visible while working on a fullscreen application. Shake a window to make it transparent and always on top. Shake it again to restore its normal state. Mouse shortcuts Add new functionalities to all your windows Add secondary functions to all the clickable elements of the window frames and access all the AquaSnap features with one click. These mouse shortcuts are fully customizable: with 15 different clickable areas, up to 5 mouse buttons recognized plus the modifier keys, the possibilities are endless! Tiny and clean A desktop enhancement tool should assist you without slowing down your computer. It's why AquaSnap is 100% composed of highly optimized native code, with no compromise on stability and performance. It uses very little memory and nearly no CPU. FAQ about the Steam version Why is the price slightly higher on Steam than on your website? Because the Steam license allows you to install AquaSnap on several computers whereas the one sold on our website is for one computer only. Can try it before I buy it? Yes, a trial version is available on our website . Can I use other Steam games while AquaSnap is running? Yes, and AquaSnap will not interfere with your 'In Game' status.",
