    "About the game": "'Crime ran rampant through the streets, but Harold and Benny played every club and dive to spread that sweet sound of music to every ear that could hear. However... Crime breeds fear, and fear feeds the dark. The ghosts and ghasts reach out and eat more than the boys can beat! If sound can't stop these bad bones, maybe a little balacera can...' ​ Heroes Harold and Benny take a break from playing with their ska band to rid the world of the merciless Nugnur and its horde of evil skeletons in this retro-styled run n' gun game full of color, energetic music, and fast-paced action! Featuring: Fun gameplay with non-stop action Colorful pixel art Energetic ska soundtrack Stages loosely inspired by real places from around the world 2-player local co-op Playful tone similar to classic run n' gun arcade games from the 90s INSTRUCTIONS The instructions for this game can be found at: It’s highly recommended that you play Balacera Brothers with a gamepad instead of the keyboard. Follow these instructions to set it up: • Make sure your gamepad is plugged in before running the game. • Go to Options &gt; Control Options &gt; Setup Player 1 • The first action, 'Move Up', is selected by default. Press Enter on your keyboard, followed by the button on the gamepad you want to assign that action to (in this case, UP in the directional pad) • After that, press the down arrow on your keyboard to highlight the next action, and repeat the process.",
