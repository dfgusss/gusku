    "About the game": "(Early Access game in alpha.) Bastide is a city-building strategy based in the 13th century where you must guide your village of peasants to thrive and survive against other villages, bandits, hunger, disease, and the cold so that they may grow into a fortified town. To survive and grow, efficiently managing your peasants is extremely important, with anything and everything ready to cause havoc at any moment. There are multiple seasons and a day and night cycle. In Bastide, there are many jobs to assign your peasants to so that they can collect food resources and expand the town. Start from nothing and build your village up into a large town. Using the resources nearby, you must construct buildings and assign jobs, increasing resources and food production to enable survival and growth. Use the surrounding animals to either hunt or to place into pastures. Hunting animals will provide meat, wool and hide. Allowing your people to get food, clothes, tools and stay warm. Multiple difficulties and turning off enemies allow players to have a relaxing or demanding experience. Future fixes and additions can be found on Bastide's Trello page: -roadmap",
