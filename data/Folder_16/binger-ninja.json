Each floor represents a new level with each elevator representing the progression to the next stage, your objective is to pass through the different stages using any means necessary, stealth or aggressive, and complete your mission. Features Stealth - The player can stealth their way past difficult enemies and use their environment to conceal them and give them the upper hand in battles. Hunger - Due to Binger's nature, eating is vital. Whilst food can be used to attack the enemies, they can also be used to fill Binger's ever decreasing health bar. Diverse themes - The environment in the game changes throughout the story, with curious enemies and environments getting introduced throughout. Narrative - The comedic story is unveiled through both the dialogue and the surroundings the player finds themselves surrounded in.",
