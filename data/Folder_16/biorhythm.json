You'll swim through the bloodstream to the beat, exploring, fighting other microbes, and duplicating yourself as you go. As the progression of your lifecycle weakens the body, you'll face terrifying challenges; vicious microbes, hungering white blood cells, intense fever. The game runs 2.5 - 3 hours. It features hand-painted art, an orchestral score, and a thrilling story. Grow a swarm of bacteria and explore the human body at a microscopic scale Encounter strange microbes &amp; fearsome white blood cells Live as an outsider in a vast, incomprehensible system Created by Brady Soglin. Art by Anna Cich &amp; Jackie Lombard. Sounds by Dylan Payne &amp; Bobby Volpendesta.",
