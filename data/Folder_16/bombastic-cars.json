    "About the game": "Bombastic Cars is a fast-paced, action packed car game in which you can choose from a variety of crazy weapons , maps and cars! You can block paths with huge, fiery tornadoes that suck your opponents in the air, stun them with icy projectiles or simply hail bombs on your foes and more. There is only one goal: Destroy all of your enemys in order to win! There are absolutely no rules or forced tactics, you choose how to succeed. Bombastic Cars features a splitscreen mode that supports up to four players at once, so you can play with your friends at home, like in the good old days before online games were a thing. You can, of course, also choose to play online solo (both ranked or unranked matches) or with your friends (only unranked matches). We've included 6 different maps that will all require a different playstyle and tactics: A volcanic hillside A slippry frozen lake A large harbour where you can use different jumps to gain an advantage A vast, open wintry desert where you can race at top-speed A weird, distant planet where you will need to avoid icy cristals that freeze you upon contact A loft that will have you drive around on sunbeds as if you were controlling toy cars You can pick different cars that all have their own feel to them and thus will fit your preference. Check out the screenshots to see which cars are currently included. Bombastic cars is still being developed by XOAProductions, thus players will benefit from new maps, brand new cars and weapons in the future. Also we are planning to include different variations to the gamemode like Capture the flag, Team Deathmatch or Destruction Races. Stay tuned for future updates!",
