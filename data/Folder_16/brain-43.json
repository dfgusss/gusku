    "About the game": "Attention 1.This game may make you feel depressed, irritable and other discomfort. When these situations occur, stop the game. 2. When the game is over, you need to delete all data to start over 3. TWO CHOICES, ONE CHOICE This is a game, also a story. More introduction? Sorry, no. Because... The end of the story depends on your mood. Of course, there may be only one feeling after playing many times. How much time do I need to finish the game? This is a short story, this is a long story. Different people, different moods, different attitudes, these will determine the time of the story, it may be 5 to 10 minutes, it may be 1 to 2 hours, it may be longer. Digression I want to tell this story to everyone and listen to everyone's thoughts. Since I only master English and Chinese, I cannot translate the content into more languages. I'm sorry. So I didn't encrypt the code. If you like, you can translate and improve it, and post your work to Steam to share with everyone.",
