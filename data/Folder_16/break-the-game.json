The game is the 'sequel' to the small free game 'Escape the Game'. The game is heavily influenced by games like Thomas was Alone, Undertale, The Stanley Parable, Lisa and various story-driven games. Throughout the whole game, Kevin and other characters will constantly talk with you . Banter on choices you do or just talk about random pointless stuff. The game also includes a collection of weapons, awesome music, aliens, the meaning of life, yadda yadda. You know, normal gaming stuff. Features Ok. You're not convinced yet. It's fine. I'm prepared. Look at this list of fantastic features! Story-driven Shooting Atmospheric Lots of characters The best companion ever (yeah, that's me) Cool stuff (there's some cool stuff in here. yeah.) Graphics? (graphics is good to have) Music and stuff? Fun! (just trust me on this one) See! Sounds great! Right? No? Damnit. Ok. I'll give you a nice hat afterward. HAHAHA! I got you on the hook now! Oh. Still No? Ok. I see how it is. Fine. I didn't want you to play it anyway. pleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeease. - Kevin . Secret @FredholmSimon",
