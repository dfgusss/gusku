    "About the game": "Fight your way from the streets to the skyscrapers in this Old-School Action Game! When a vicious gang tries to burn down their favorite video shop, Sidney Flintlock and Justine Jacobs take to the streets to bust some heads.  Breakneck City is an Old-School 3D Beat 'Em Up with a focus on environmental interactions.  Featuring low-poly graphics and pixel-art textures, and the ability to play in 2-player co-op mode, Breakneck City brings late-90s style 3D Beat 'Em Up action to a new generation. Punch, Kick and dodge across 6 levels including city streets, a dance club, a skyscraper and more! Take on gangs of enemies and tough bosses. Pick up weapons to become even more effective in combat, and use the environment to your advantage. Swing on lamp posts, kick your foes into garbage bins and out of windows, and deal devastating dive-kicks from above. You'll have to use your surroundings to your advantage against these challenging foes.",
