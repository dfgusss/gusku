Detailed statistics of each level will let you know how good you are and which rank you have achieved. Updated graphics with cool pixel art that combines the rigor of retro style and the beauty of a modern palette. Realistic explosions and an abundance of special effects. Intuitive control. You can use several different schemes of control of the tank and won't miss the FIRE button for sure. Music produced specifically for this game.
