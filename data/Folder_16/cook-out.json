    "About the game": "Get your aprons ready… things are about to get messy in this award-winning multiplayer VR cooking game from Resolution Games! Set within the cook’s cabin of a fairytale forest, Cook-Out: A Sandwich Tale is a wacky and whimsical adventure - brought to you by the creators of Angry Birds VR: Isle of Pigs, Bait! and Blaston - that challenges up to four players to work together to keep the orders coming for a hungry cast of enchanted creatures in this multiplayer VR game. As players progress through increasingly hectic levels, they not only prepare meals but also need to fight off a number of nasty customers who seem absolutely set on making trouble -- like jesters who will hide parts of orders, or thieves who will keep pilfering ingredients. With some of the game’s most recent updates, players can add to the fun by upgrading their chef’s look with the “Make it Your Way feature” and join the “House Party” update for new skins, customizations and more! While the game is focused on cooperative play, solo players can also enjoy the experience with the help of a simulated partner, making sure there’s always a team to tackle tough orders and restore the calm to this wild kitchen.",
