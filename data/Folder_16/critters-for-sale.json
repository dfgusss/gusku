    "About the game": "Critters for Sale is a compilation of 5 short stories: Snake , Goat , Monkey , Dragon , and Spider . All of which occur in different eras and locations, touching on themes like time travel, black magic, and immortality. A journey in which you meet characters familiar and foreign to you, ranging from inhabitants of a garden in Earth's orbit, aliens from Neptune, Noid Men from neighboring timelines, and residents of a certain Reincarnation Palace. A hybrid between Point And Click and Visual Novel , the game puts you in the shoes of characters that marked the unseen history of the world as we know it, right in the center of events that portray a cosmic force looming above, vouching for evil, wanting to see you and your world crumble. The actions and choices you make throughout the game influence the outcome of each episode, ultimately leading to your death or survival. Evade your doom, and you might be able to make a difference in the grand scheme of things. The story unfolds in five episodes, playable in any order, taking you on journeys influenced by the surreal horrors of Middle Eastern and North African folktales. With multiple endings each, you will be able to live and relive the dreadful terror depicted throughout Critters for Sale .",
