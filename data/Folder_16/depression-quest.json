You are given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and possible treatment.

Over 40k words of interactive fiction. Playthroughs are short enough to be done in one day, but long enough for the game to have gotten it's point across. About 150 unique encounters. Based on your depression levels, different choices open and close off to you. Content generated based on your decisions. The choices you make have a real effect on how your playthrough turns out. Multiple endings. See how your choices affected the game's world, and how well you've managed your depression. Audio and visuals react to your depression. Listen as the music gets glitchier and see how much stronger the static gets. Watch the color get sucked out of how you see the world.",
