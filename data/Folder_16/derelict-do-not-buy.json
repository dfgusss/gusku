    "About the game": "NOTE: DO NOT BUY THE GAME, READ LATEST UPDATE IN THE NEWS SECTION DERELICT YOUR MISSION Your Codename from now on will be [REDACTED] and your mission is quite simple, get to the station’s control center by any means necessary, collect all the data from its database and “contain” the station (instructions will be given via better encrypted channels once you’re at the station). THE STATION This space station is HUGE, capable of housing all sorts of labs and facilities within it, the station’s labs are divided in 4 sectors, and each sector contains huge artificial landscapes on floating chunks of rock called “Nodes”, these nodes are grouped together by the subjects' dangerous nature, these groups are called “Clusters”, there are 2 clusters in each sector, and each sector containing 2 subjects, the two most dangerous ones are safely located in the central Sector 5, buried within the station, safely isolated from everything and everyone. Some of the nodes are off limits and are the containment location for a subject, a place that has been prepared just for that subject in both environment and structures to resemble its former habitat but being safely secured with all the necessary safety measures. This station is containing highly dangerous creatures from across the galaxy, this is the reason why the government panicked when it went missing, so do not expect a walk in the park when you’re deployed, you may be a super solder but you will definitely die if you’re not careful enough, I trust you will know when to shoot your way through or run and hide. The Subjects There are many creatures locked down in there, 10 of them however, are the most dangerous, these were handpicked as the most dangerous to be found across the known galaxy, they are NOT to be taken lightly, some of them are less dangerous than others but they are all deadly and, if they were to escape, they might spread across the station. If Subject [REDACTED] and Subject [REDACTED] have escaped then I feel sorry for you already, that’s all I can say. ABOUT THE GAME This game is a SciFi/Horror First Person Shooter with a rather retro feel to its design and mechanics, heavily inspired by games from the late 90’s and early 2000’s, the final version of the game will eventually contain 4 main game modes: - Single Player Campaign - Multiplayer - Survival Mode - Shoot ‘Em All The initial soon-to-come release however, will just have Survival Mode with experimental, replaceable maps, one gun, and enemies that are part of Subject [REDACTED] Once multiplayer mode is released it’s going to have the following game modes: - Free-For-All Shooter - Capture the Flag Potential Multiplayer Gametypes if multiplayer succeeds: - King of the Hill - Co-op Survival Mode This project is pretty ambitious but possible with your constant feedback, remember this is a community game so feel free to share your ideas and opinions at all times. The game is currently in Early Access Alpha Stage and, as mentioned and highlighted above, will be released only with Survival Mode, as I keep updating the game more content will be released and eventually more game modes will come out.
