    "About the game": "Diamond Hands: To The Moon is a simple to play, yet difficult to master jumping platform game where the ultimate goal is to get to the moon. You control your character by moving left, right and by jumping - and that's it. With practice, you'll be able to perfect your jump by controlling the jump's strength to land on any target platform. Apes that get to the moon will earn not only the title of diamond hands, but will also be showered in their heart's most luxurious desires! Special homage &amp; shout-out to Jump King, it's one of our all time favourites. Apes alone .. Weak! Solo mode for those players seeking the most challenging adventure. Apes together .. Strong! Play with friends in up to 10 player co-op. Online public and private servers available. Beat the record Challenge the world's best speed runners to secure a spot in the Hall of Fame! This game is inspired by/a parody of the events that occurred in the war of Reddit vs Wall Street. The game's environment, and changing theme explores the stages of investment a newcomer might experience when first getting to grips with trading stocks. There are 10 distinct environments, some of which include: - Stock Exchange - Game - Crayon Land - Dark Pool - FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) - Chicken Tendie Land - + 4 others (We aren't going to spoil the surprise!) Disclaimer: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE WE JUST LIKE THE STOCK.",
