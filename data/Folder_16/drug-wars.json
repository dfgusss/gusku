    "About the game": "Drug Wars is a gritty, gory romp through a futuristic New York City, circa 3100, where severe global warming conditions have resulted in a harsh divide between upper-class Brooklyn gang bosses and a booming population of engineered Neanderthal bottom-dwellers. Using the powerful Crytek 2 Engine, Paleo Entertainment offers players of Drug Wars a collection of varied maps rife for fast-paced multiplayer chaos, featuring a deadly variety of weapons, including everything from a biomechanical arm to environmental objects - including the severed limbs of your foes - to gain control of the coveted drug trade. Add in several brand-new vehicles to both traverse across the detailed landscapes and mow down your opponents, and Drug Wars offers up a slew of game options to keep players addicted to the bloody fun.",
