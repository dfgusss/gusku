    "About the game": "Congratulations Don Jonz! You have just won a Virtual Adventure Vacation on Eternam, the biggest and best planetary Funpark in the galaxy. Hard working intergalactic Space Marshals like yourself deserve to experience the ultimate gateway. Travel through 3D landscapes to more than a half-dozen past human eras, populated with life-like-bio=tech creatures offering tongue-in-cheek remarks. From the age of the pharaohs and the realm of medieval knights to the French Revolution and beyond, you'll have the adventure of a lifetime...or several. But, Mister Jonz, there is a slight problem... Dragoons still inhabit Eternam wanting to reclaim the park and have joined forces with your arch-rival Mikhal Nuke. They plan to ruin your vacation in a big way! At least you can count on help from the beautiful Tracy, a technician on the Eternam coordination team. Unfortunately, to escape Nuke's evil clutches,, she has dematerialized into the Funpark's computer network, so Tracy will communicate only via a computer screen. You'll need intuition, courage, wit, diplomacy, charm and a surreal sense of humor. Only you can save Eternam - and yourself. But who wouldn't face all challenges to win Tracy's smile. So...Enjoy your vacation, Mister Jonz!",
