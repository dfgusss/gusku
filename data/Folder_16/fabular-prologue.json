    "About the game": "… the last remaining royal sets out on a dangerous quest. The Void Lords have stolen the sun. Your brothers have vanished into deep space. The king grows old and fragile, searching for a better future in the endless streams of prophecy. As the last remaining royal, the fate of the kingdom rests on your shoulders – and on your blade. In Fabular, experience a sci-fi infused vision of the Middle Ages, as noble knights clash in armored spaceships. The sweeping story is brought to life through a combination of pixel art and hand drawn illustrations. Power up your engines, it’s time to take flight in Fabular: The Prologue - a free-to-play introduction to the Fabular universe that gives you access to the first two realms. Start your fight against The Void Lords and experience the epic space battles first-hand. Do you have what it takes to reclaim the sun and save your empire? Then pick up the full game Fabular: Once Upon a Spacetime. Embark on a perilous quest across a procedurally generated universe where friends and resources are both scarce. Plan ahead, be cautious, and make sure you’re prepared before engaging in combat. Every mistake could be your last. Battle your enemies in top-down, tactical physics-based action combat and overcome thrilling duels at the tip of your sword. Loot your fallen adversaries for better gear and upgrade your vessel to suit your playstyle in order to survive the next fight. Monitor your resources closely, or risk being stranded in space. Die and try again. Return to the throne room after each defeat, unlocking new boons to give yourself an edge on your future runs. Meet new faces and seek guidance from old friends, as you’ll expand the court throughout your journey. Save your kingdom against all odds by carving your path through the galaxy, challenging rival knights in fiercely intense close-combat encounters. Upgrade your arsenal of weapons, shield and equipment. Manage critical resources wisely. Make life-or-death decisions. And if you fall in battle, be prepared to do it all again. A techno-fantasy roguelike bringing jousts, quests and folktales to the stars!",
