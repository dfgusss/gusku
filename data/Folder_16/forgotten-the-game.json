    "About the game": "A game about experiencing dementia FORGOTTEN is a psychological horror game about experiencing dementia. Essentially a walking simulator with narration and disturbing imagery. Travel through progressively disturbing environments as a fox in a fantasy world while searching for items that refer to the protagonist's life. Hold each memory close to you as it might fade away, faster than you think. Take In Mind This experience is not meant for everyone This game explores themes such as depression, anxiety, loneliness, not feeling in control. FLASHING LIGHTS WARNING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT This game is meant to entertain and explore a hopeless and unfair situation someone can find themselves in. We started working on it as a side project and immediately fell in love with the concept and wanted to explore it more. So... We remade the whole game with new characters, stories, mechanics, and elements. We hope it has some impact in some way. This game is influenced by 'When The Darkness Comes' (Obviously), 'Doki Doki Literature Club', 'Omori' and many more. CONTROLS Move with WASD Toggle Sprint with LEFT SHIFT Jump with SPACE Interact with E",
