    "About the game": "Deep underground lies a reminder of Boarkind’s darkest hours . All it takes is one little boar to dig it back up. Harkening back to the NES era, Full Bore is an open-world puzzle game that leaves you to your own devices. With curiosity as your only guide, you will figure out how the blocks around you behave, delve deeper into a strange underground, and eventually piece together the story of a world transfigured. Full Bore debuts a unique lighting engine that creates rich, atmospheric environments out of its old-school pixel art. Combined with our original bluesy soundtrack, you will soon find yourself immersed in Full Bore's mines, temples, scrapyards, lava tubes, inexplicable lakes and/or mysterious laboratories. With over 150 areas, no single intended path and secrets everywhere, Full Bore gives you a world in which you can always find something new (until you find everything) Features Be a pig.* Dig. *You're actually a boar, but that doesn't rhyme with dig. Explore at your own pace as you learn how you can interact with the blocks around you Focus on puzzle-solving and exploration, not conflict. Play as either Frederick the boar or Hildi the sow Original glitch/blues soundtrack gets you in the mood to dig",
