Gabriel and Grace arrive in this town in pursuit of a kidnapped child, but a deeper, far more frightening story begins to unfold. Whispers of a sacred bloodline, vampires and a boundless treasure set the shadow hunter and his companion on an inescapable path. Their ultimate destiny is to solve a dark mystery held secret for thousands of years. Play as both Gabriel Knight and Grace Nakimura as you learn more about what is hidden in the hills of France. But beware your life, your faith and your soul. For once the truth is found, there is no erasing it. Encounter intricate puzzles critical to solving this ancient mystery. Find, acquire (and steal) a vast inventory of clues, tools, cash and more - using your clever and devious sleuthing skills. Interact with an eclectic cast of characters - each with their own agenda.
