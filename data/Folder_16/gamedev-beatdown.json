    "About the game": "Live through the life of a developer in the short game, Gamedev Beatdown. Have you ever wondered what goes behind the scenes of games that you love or whose names you never got to hear? Have you ever been in a meeting that felt more like a war room? With the loudest voice winning arguments and deciding what decision gets implemented? Play as a member of a team, making some hard and some not so hard decisions. If you win, your choices get implemented. Lose, and your game and studio might head in a direction you did not sign up for. Work your way up from arcade-style games to full-fledged AAA releases. Once you start your journey as an Indie developer, move to new studio locations and hire the right people as you work your way up in the industry. There's a lot to handle, but you've got this. It was your dream, after all. Did we tell you how Game Development wasn't easy? Decision Making - Back decisions of different departments on day to day issues. Management - Manage Employee Happiness and tactical Crunch times for maximized productivity. Procedural rogue-lite progression. Deep Combat (Allegedly) - Persistent stress tolerance (health) between projects. Think long term instead of battle to battle. Exotic Locations - Move to different locations that unlock some unique games to develop. Choices and Consequences - Fight over real, real-adjacent, and a few entirely fabricated day-to-day problems game developers face. Evolving Mini-games - Play the games you release as mini-games that look better and/or unlock functionality with higher stats on release.",
