    "About the game": "Gob, a classic RPG slime, finds himself in a predicament when he stumbles upon a 'Hero' slaying innocent people and other slimes in the pursuit of the Goblet Eternal. When the hero realizes he's been spotted committing his crimes, he chases Gob through dangerous terrain wielding his deadly sword. The 'Hero' will stop at nothing to silence Gob for what he has seen, but Gob is cunning and won't be caught easily. Mechanics Jump over gaps, obstacles, enemies, spikes and more Slide under tight spaces and deadly things Spring on springboards to reach otherwise unreachable places Hazards Dehydration in the desert is real. Find pools of water to rehydrate Gob along his journey Sandstorms in the desert will surely kill Gob unless he can outrun them Falling off cliffs is a real risk Blizzards can blow Gob into spikes or off of cliffs in snow worlds Snow and ice squalls can be deadly unless Gob can outrun them Classic platformer mechanics such as falling platforms, moving platforms, spinning platforms, traps and switches are also standing in the way of victory",
