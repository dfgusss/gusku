Be smart and you will be able to protect your people. For every five waves you survive, you will be rewarded by the mayor with one Mana. This Mana can unlock more powerful towers : you have the choice to spend it in one of the six Mana present in the world. By doing so, you will learn how to build the tower related to it. If you have two different Manas unlocked, you will have the possibility to build Harmony towers which are made of two different Manas.
