    "Release date": "May 30, 2018",
    "About the game": "Run, Jump, Glide, Bounce and maneuver your way through unique and challenging levels. Lack of elegance, however, will get your *** in lava, and nobody wants any of that. HotFloor is a first person action parkour game. Controls are tight and movement feels just right. If all else fails, you can still watch lava dry.",
