    "Name": "Kartong - Death by Cardboard!",
    "Release date": "Apr 4, 2018",
    "About the game": "In a twisted world best described as ”a miniature cardboard city turned into a malicious science experiment”, you find yourself captured against your will by an oddly charming but mysterious YouTuber that goes by the name ' Sven ' in the deadly city of Kartong. Your life now depends on mediocre office supply-weapons and your every move is being filmed for his YouTube enjoyment - a truly odd experience, all wrapped up in challenging stealth/FPS gameplay. And oh, did we mention that you’re shrunk to the size of a toilet paper roll? Yes, you’re small... very small. Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR Kartong - Death by Cardboard! combines the cuteness of scary toys with the charm of paper cuts - all wrapped up in challenging stealth/FPS gameplay (that’s a legit genre, right?). VR or Non-VR, it's all up to you! Both PC and VR modes will offer procedurally generated levels with maps, traps, weapons and toy enemies constantly changing. A unique seed system also allows you to replay your favorite maps and share them with friends! New Progression and Skins! No worries, no loot boxes here! However, to upgrade your crossbow you need Robo-Coins. These coins can be obtained by smacking some robot-butt! Each time you slay a robot they will drop coins that can be gathered to upgrade your crossbow throughout the game. Hasta la vista, baby! Life never gets easier! So, you managed to find your way out of the city? Well, it ain't over yet pal. Kartong’s many difficulty levels will push you to the limit of your own madness. We would say “Prepare To Die”, but that’s a bit cliche now ain’t it? Become the ultimate maze-warrior! Kartong features a a local high score system for each difficulty as well as unique seeds to control the maps. So now you can challenge your friends for the best scores, get the sweetest upgrades and show off your rarest loot! You like watching them and so do we! With the new gameplay concept Kartong Co-Labs, we'll be able to put your favorite streamers and YouTubers into the deadly cardboard world of Kartong. The custom-made Co-Labs maps will feature different guest events, providing players with a growing library of challenge maps to play and explore. The various Co-Labs partners will be announced inside the game and on SVRVIVE Studios’ website as they go live. A game jam gone horribly wrong! After launching our previous title SVRVIVE: The Deus Helix, our dev team held a 'lets-go-bonkers' game jam to blow off some steam. Obviously troubled by some very disturbing thoughts (disclaimer: we blame office air pollution), our team came up with Kartong. And once conceived, we had no choice but to bring a new unpronounceable game to the world.",
