Keeper of the Sun and Moon is a 310,000 word interactive fantasy novel by Brynn Chernosky, where your choices control the story. It’s entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. You knew your school year was off to a rocky start when you were attacked by a gorgon. Whisked away to New World Magi Academy, you’re thrown into life at a college for supernatural in the midst of unprecedented turmoil in the city. There’s a war brewing between angels and demons in New Magi City—and the theft of the powerful celestial artifacts does nothing to abate tensions... Play as male, female, or non-binary; gay, straight, bi, or asexual. Romance one of ten love interests, from a cute shifter to a snarky telepath. Experience life as one of seven unique species as you learn to control your powers. Choose your classes for each semester, from Telekinesis to Sigils and Runes.
