    "About the game": "Destroy all the cubes! Use the laser to launch your cubes and match your colors by 3 or more, to remove all cubes from the level to move to the next level. You have a limited number of moves to successfully remove everything, otherwise, other cubes will be added in front and on top. You also randomly have bonus cubes that can give you a life, eliminate a color or use a bomb. If you have too many cubes in height, you'll be warned, if you reach 4 warnings it's game over. You have 3 game modes: - Classic: Access to bonus - Extreme: Without any bonus and with a limited number of lives - Collapse: Access to bonus and the edges tighten to the middle each time a column is removed.",
