    "About the game": "The disturbing story of a broken family Set in a post-soviet Eastern Europe, Last Days of Lazarus tells the story of a troubled man, long estranged, returning to his childhood home after his mother’s death to spend some time with his sister Lyudmila. But as the country around him seems to fall apart, so does reality itself, with a series of unexplainable events leading him on a quest to find out more about his family’s disturbing past. The supernatural bleeds into a post-communist nightmare Last Days of Lazarus is a first-person adventure game with a strong narrative and rich visuals drawing its inspiration from the post soviet era with a Gothic vibe and supernatural elements. As the story unravels, you’ll meet questionable characters whose corrupted version of the truth you’ll need to navigate. With a troubled past yourself, you’ll struggle not only with solving the mysteries laid upon you but also with keeping alive any sliver of hope for salvation. Real life influences and beliefs Inspired by our country's history and locations, Last Days of Lazarus tells a story filled with supernatural elements of local belief, laid upon communist and post-communist struggles. In a sick society where everyone cares only about themselves and their survival, can family bonds still be upheld and cherished? And with so much propaganda and superstitions, can level headed thinking still be achieved?",
