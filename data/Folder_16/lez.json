    "Name": "LEZ",
    "Release date": "May 27, 2022",
    "About the game": "LEZ is a rhythm game in the style of osu!mania with 6 keys. It's an indie game made by only one person in July 2020 with the goal to make a creative rhythm game with a unique design. Integration with Logitech G Hub for a better experience of the RGB API with Discord Streamer mode for avoid the copyright Q: DID THE DEVELOPER BOUGHT THE LICENSES OF THE SONGS OR THE GAME? A: Yes, we also got some songs from Newgrounds and we'll make sure if the songs can be used for free commercially, and some songs that can't be used commercially, we contacted with the artists for discuss for use some of their songs, we also contacted to other artists, but some songs of those artists won't be used due for the price of the licensing of the songs for commercial/official use. Q: THE GAMEPLAY WILL BE ONLY WITH 6 KEYS OR CAN WE CHANGE IT? A: The gameplay will be only with 6 keys (6K), because almost all the games like osu! (mania), Friday Night Funkin', etc, use 4 keys and we want to make the game more unique. Q: CAN I BE A BETA TESTER OR CAN I GET THE GAME EARLY OR HELP YOU TESTING FOR UPCOMING VERSIONS? A: NO &gt;:( Q: WILL THE GAME HAVE AN EDITOR MODE? A: Now this is confirmed, and yes, the game will have beatmap editor. We have thinking a lot about this and now we can finally add that, but there's some rules: Don't sell the beatmaps, the beatmaps NEED to be free to play Don't use songs if you dont already contacted to the artist of that song even if is an unofficial beatmap Q: WHAT DOES LEZ MEAN? A: We choose that name for make it like osu! (like make an original name) and we have thought that it does NOT have a meaning, but we discovered that it have a lot of meanings that we dont want to tell for security (you can search if you want, but we think that is not recomended, as we said, for security)",
