    "About the game": "*WARNING!* This game contains strong language, violence, sexual abuse, sexual assault/non-consensual sex, prostitution, drug/alcohol abuse, and self-harm. Viewer discretion is advised. If the gaming publishers were social media this game would be a shitpost. You play as DeShawn whose ship crashes on the island of Dedade and you must repair and supply the ship to set sail but not before learning and exploiting this island to his advantage. This is the first game I ever made. I didn't know RPG Maker MZ was a real engine. I thought it was like Mario Maker so when I started making this game I was blown away from how much it could do. It was a great learning experience from beginning to end. I definitely bit off more than I could chew. Now I wish RMMZ had a little more stuff in it but plugins and parallax scenes were outside the scope of my first game. I truly hope you enjoy this game and if so then tell your friends! Word of mouth is everything! Much Love, Blue Milk Studios.",
