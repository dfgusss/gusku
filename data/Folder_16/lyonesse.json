    "About the game": "Lyonesse is a mythical land off the coast of Cornwall. The Seven Stones Reef in the Celtic Sea is thought to be the remnants of this long-forgotten place. Mythology tells of how the Edenic island was buried under the sea by the gods because the inhabitants led lives of pure hedonism. On stormy days, fishermen still claim to catch nefarious objects from the city in their nets. You play as an explorer who has navigated the perilous journey to the island after hearing the stories of its wondrous beauty. Alone, you row to shore and discover its secrets. Lyonesse is a point-and-click game. You experience the mythical land by navigating through hundreds of hand-drawn panels. Moving between each unique panel will allow you to explore the island and experience its erotic encounters. A brief visit will typically last the player 45 minutes, but discovering all the secrets Lyonesse and its nymphs have to offer will captivate the player for much longer. The game’s story is organised into four seasons of festivities. Each season, the voyeur is visited by a unique nymph. Between each act, the player sleeps under a great orange tree. On your journey, you are accompanied by two kittens named Crucible and Caliban. As the seasons proceed, the orange trees slowly flourish and begin to bear fruit. Back to the sunset bound of Lyonesse— A land of old upheaven from the abyss By fire, to sink into the abyss again; Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt, And the long mountains ended in a coast Of ever-shifting sand, and far away The phantom circle of a moaning sea. from Idylls of the King: The Passing of Arthur By Alfred, Lord Tennyson",
