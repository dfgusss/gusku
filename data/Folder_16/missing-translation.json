    "About the game": "Lost in a weird city in the middle of the desert and surrounded by strange creatures that keep staring at you. This is a game about exploring the unknown and solving puzzles... lots of them! Don't be fooled by the looks, this isn't your typical point &amp; click adventure, you'll spend your time solving them. Key Features No tutorials, hints or even text to be found here. This wasn't made to increase difficulty but to let the player do everything on his own, 'Missing Translation' isn't a hard game, but we don't like hand-holding. REPEAT, NO TEXT. Everyone can enjoy it regardless of the language they speak :D Three different puzzle mechanics, each of those features 25 levels to complete. Beautiful black and white pixel art... ... did I already say we have cats? Two different characters to choose from. Additional challenges involving a drawn language that can be learned up to some point. Great soundtrack that has evolved with the rest of the game over development. FREE! No ads, cash shop or any of those modern things.",
