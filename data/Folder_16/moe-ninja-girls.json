Surrounded by girls your age, you finally get the peaceful everyday school life that you've always longed for. After a series of events, you end up starting a 'Ninja Seeking Club' at school to find ninjas! As you spend your days busy with girls and club activities, you start to discover the true identities of your fellow club members... Can you unmask your favorite girl's identity? And what's the big secret behind Mizaki School? YOUR CUTE GIRLFRIENDS: Akari Hanao – “We're in the same class...and our seats are so close...it's gotta be fate, right?!” A classmate of yours. She always thinks positively, though sometimes she is too starry-eyed. Active, athletic, and relatively smart, she livens up the party, while also sometimes getting herself and the people around her in trouble. She admires ninjas and comes up with the idea to set up a 'Ninja Seeking Club'. Enju Saion-ji – “Oh well... If you're having trouble, I suppose I can tell you whatever you need to know.” A classmate of yours. She is a member of the student council and is smart as well as agile. Can seem commanding at times, but is actually caring by nature, so she takes care of Akari despite often being dragged into trouble by her. Does not show people how she lives her private life. Rumor says she comes from a millionaire family. Ricka Machiyuki – “No problem. Don't think about who is behind you. Just take your lessons.” A classmate of yours, who transferred right after you. Always stays quiet and poker-faced, creating a mysterious mood around her. From time to time she says things that sound unsettling, but her classmates hope that she is only joking. Likes video games. Loves fried noodle hotdogs.
