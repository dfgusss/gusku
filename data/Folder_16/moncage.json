The game takes place inside a mysterious cube, with each side of the cube housing a unique world: be it an old factory, a light tower, an amusement park, or a church, etc. At first sight, they may seem random and unrelated, but upon closer look, you will become mesmerized by the subtle and intricate ways of how these worlds connect…… 【Solve Puzzles with Mind-Boggling Optical Illusions】 Use your imagination and spare no brain cells to find the connection and pinpoint every possible interaction between different sides of the cube, then watch as the magic unfold in front of you. 【Collect All Photos to Unveil the Story】 Behind the puzzles, there lies a story with a surprising twist for the player to uncover. Collect the photos from obscure corners and angles to reveal the underlying story, one photo at a time. 【Get Unstuck with Thoughtful Hints】 There is a multitude of guidance systems to help prevent players from getting stuck. Focus can be activated to highlight the key items to the solution, while hint texts are available to provide further clarity. And, if all else fails, video walkthroughs can be unlocked as the ultimate safety plan. 【Prove Your Puzzle-Solving Skills with Medals】 There are a total of 15 achievements in the game, each corresponding with a Medal that has been crafted with a uniquely stunning design. A complete collection of the 15 Medals could be the perfect evidence to attest to your master puzzle-solving skills~",
