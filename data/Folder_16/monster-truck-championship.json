    "About the game": "A true Monster Truck simulation! From Las Vegas to Orlando, go head-to-head against experienced drivers in drag races and freestyle competitions! But before you can pull off doughnuts, wheelies and bicycles, you must first tune your truck to perfection. These machines are spectacular and impressive yet highly technical to drive. The game faithfully reproduces all the unique demands of mastering these powerful trucks, including independent front and rear wheel management, mass transfer anticipation in bends, and predicting bounces after jumps.   But what's performance without style? Customise your Monster Truck to reflect your style and show it off to your 7 opponents in online mode. 16 different Monster Trucks Over 50 customisable elements 25 arenas 3 different leagues",
