    "About the game": "Go on a romantic adventure in this BL visual novel! Hinata wants to fulfill his lifelong dream of studying abroad in New York, but the moment he arrives, everything starts going downhill. He is tricked out of his apartment, a stranger has stolen his identity and enrolled at university in his stead, and he is stranded without any idea of how to deal with this mess. But then a handsome stranger offers his help, and suddenly Hinata finds himself in a shared apartment with three hot guys. A rollercoaster of emotions begins, and Hinata soon discovers that his roommates are hiding more secrets than they let on. He looks like a university student on the outside. He is tall, slender, attractive, smart and is top of his class, making him popular on campus. His arrogance and recklessness are overlooked because of his good looks. Behind the attractive facade, however, he is an elite assassin who has been trained since he was very young. He is an obvious street gang member on the outside, but on the inside he is actually a clown, sly, friendly and cares about his friends. He is part of the gang '66' and is highly trusted by his group. He also works as a middleman at a bar that secretly serves the needs of underground society. He is very charming and a complete gentleman. Although he is always smiling and has a gentle attitude, it makes it impossible to figure out his true feelings. He earns a living by being a conman and the rumor is that he will con anyone as long as there is money involved...
