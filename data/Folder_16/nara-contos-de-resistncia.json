    "About the game": "Enter the world of this stealthy Adventure Platformer, in which you use the powers of 7 elemental arrows to participate in the most important events in Brazilian history. IMPORTANT INFORMATIONS The game is in the first version of its Early Access. The experience is fun and engaging and you will be able to understand about the beginning of our heroine's journey. But there are bugs to be fixed and polishes/balances to be implemented. We count on the understanding and support of the community, so that we can continue to evolve NaÀra to deliver an amazing game in its final version. If you have feedback, please send it through our Discord ( ) or by email at naara@rebulico.com . At the moment, the game does not have full keyboard support, as we highlighted in the Steam notice. You need a Joystick to be able to perform all of NaÀra actions. At the moment, the game is only available in Brazilian Portuguese. The localization to english is already done and will be implemented soon. We will inform when it’s available. In our Early Access, only the 'Nação Tupi' level is available at this time. As stated in the Early Access description, the levels 'Guerra de Cabo Frio', 'Quilombo dos Palmares' and one more yet to be revealed will be added in updates with the game still in Early Access. The final 4 stages will only be released in version 1.0 (Official Release of the full game). There are some parts where tutorials are missing. They will be implemented soon, in the meantime, if you need assistance, please request support via our Discord ( ) or via email at naara@rebulico. Soon we will make available a public Roadmap, containing the details and timeframes for the implementation of the improvements, new features and bug fixes that will come with the continuous updates of our Early Access. We will always cherish transparency in communication with players and we greatly appreciate anyone who can play and support the development of brazilian independent games! LONG LIVE THE RESISTANCE STORIES! LIVE NAÀRA! Mará is missing, it's been 3 long years since she left for her last trip. NaÀra looks forward to her mother's return, but a fateful day has arrived and the wait must turn into action. Only Mará will know how to deal with what is coming. Explore the history of Brazil in search of Mará, fighting oppression alongside the heroes and heroines who were icons of resistance in the past. In NaÀra: Tales of Resistance, a 2D Cinematic Platformer of Adventure, Stealth and Puzzle, control NaÀra, a young and elusive indigenous of the Tupinambá Nation, in this adventure through time. As NaÀra travels through history and understands the real meaning of her mother's choices, she will also understand about the history of oppression on which the country was built, but most importantly, about the constant and inherent importance of resisting. --- With a complex narrative that brings up Brazil's past to discuss its present and its future, in the skin of our heroine NaÀra, players will have a range of fluid movements at their disposal. Sneak through the shadows and survive the bloodiest conflicts in the country's history. But not only that, Mará left the final resistance tools for NaÀra: the Pindorama Bow, a very powerful weapon that the player will be able to evolve during the game, and which is also the home of Godô, the AI parrot who will guide our heroine through this adventure! And the Ether Bracelet, which will allow NaÀra to embark on the incredible Journey of Resistance that is about to begin. Traveling through time, at each stage she will visit a different period of Brazilian history, participating in some of the most important moments of resistance of Brazilian peoples. Use the elements of each arrow to solve puzzles, disable enemies, move in innovative ways, and with that, infiltrate the most secret events in Brazilian history, in missions that can change not only your future, but the future of an entire nation. MAIN FEATURES A Journey through Time Each stage of NaÀra will be set in a different period of Brazilian history, with challenges, puzzles and different enemies, according to the conflicts of each era. Explore Brazil Each level will be set in a different region of Brazil, from the forests of Porto Seguro in 1500, through the arid areas of Canudos in 1897, to the stone jungle of Rio in 2013. The Arrows of Pindorama With 7 different elemental arrows, you'll be able to interact with the world and enemies in unique ways, using them to solve combat and puzzle scenarios. Choices Matter In NaÀra, the player will be able to make important decisions through dialogues with the heroes of each era. The actions chosen during the conflicts will also have consequences. Precision is Key With a fluid and diverse range of movements at your disposal, the player, controlling our heroine, will be able to climb, swim and use her Bow and Arrow to help her locomote in a precise way. Your way of Resisting Take on challenges head-on using your arrows for combat, evade conflict through your agility, or sneak through the shadows to be a hidden agent. It's your choice! TRAVEL THROUGH BRAZILIAN HISTORY IN 8 LEVELS Each at a different time in Brazilian history. Get to know the local folks, customs and cultures of each era. Meet and battle side by side with important historical characters. See and visit historical sites and landmarks of the places you will pass. Learn more about the people, places, fauna and flora of each era using the Travel Diary written by Mará, accessible through Godô, the AI ​​of the Pindorama Bow.
