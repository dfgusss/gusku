    "About the game": "2D platform game with minimalist pixel art graphics in which your mission is to protect the portal without dying when facing an army with more than 1,000 monsters, for every 100 monsters other types of defeated monsters begin to appear to make your mission even more difficult. To defeat this entire army you have the following skills: Create Platform Below You. Shoot. Jump and Crouch. Walk Both Left and Right. The graphics of the game are almost all in black, white and gray but in some parts the shades in red. The story of the game is about two emperors who ruled in partnership, but one day it was over because of mysterious events that you as a player must discover by paying close attention to how much you play. One Pixel was thought of as a game to raise funds for something bigger, but I ended up falling in love with the project and it became much more than that, so I hope you fall in love too. But what about seeing who's better? Me in making you give up on zeroing this game or you in getting to the end and find out what's there.",
