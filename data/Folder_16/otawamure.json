    "About the game": "'Otawamure' is a Japanese word meaning 'to play around, to fool around or toy with'. This VR experience provides a virtual space where you can feel “otawamure” yourself while playing with tender objects. The space has three activities inside. In one of them, you’ll find yourself carefully cutting eggs using a string, trying to slice them just right. Another will give you a hand fan to blow a set of quirky objects away. And in the last one jiggly, bouncy puddings will drop from the sky for you to catch. None of these experiences has a specific goal or objective, but we hope they can help you experience “otawamure”.",
