    "Name": "Pixel Game Maker MV",
    "Release date": "Sep 19, 2019",
    "About the game": "Make action, adventure, shoot-‘em-ups... even multiplayer (up to four players!) games can be created with ease! Have a great idea for a game, but don’t have anyone to pitch it to, or any programming experience? Now with Pixel Game Maker MV, you can turn that idea into an actual, playable game with nothing but a PC and this software! Make the games you want to play, the way you want to play them: side-scrolling action platformers, top-down adventure/RPGs, multiplayer VS. battles, racing, puzzles, pinball, shoot-‘em-ups, horror, Metroidvania... You name it, you can make it in the style and genre of your choice! Simple enough even for total beginners! The basic controls and functions are extremely simple and easy to pick up. Create pixel-based animations, and set up your game map. Create objects, decide how you want them to move, and then simply add them to the scene in which you want to use them. Just follow these simple steps, and you can create an entire game just like that! Feel free to try rearranging and adjusting the various steps and processes to see what sort of unique games and mechanics you can create! Includes all the samples and materials you’ll need to get started: character animations, tiles, music, and more! PGMMV is packaged together with all sorts of materials and samples that you can freely use, combine, and tweak to make whatever sort of game you can like. You can even mix and match the preloaded materials with your own creations; for example, using them as simple guides to create the pixel animations yourself from scratch and then combining them with included sample maps and music. This makes it even easier to create and expand upon games of virtually any genre! Includes hit games like La-Mulana 2 and Kero Blaster as sample projects! Take advantage of various plug-ins to expand the creative possibilities even further! For more advanced users, try using JavaScript plug-ins to create even more complex and detailed actions, animations, and full games! While no programming or scripting ability is necessary to create games and the various elements required, user-created plug-ins and scripts will allow you to take your creations to the next level – and far beyond. Not only can you freely distribute your games as you like, but you can even distribute them for profit through Gotcha Gotcha Games and the Nintendo Switch! Not only can you make your own games in any way you like, with Pixel Game Maker MV you are also able to freely distribute your creations however you see fit. You are even free to sell your games on any PC gaming platform and in any region in the world! And that’s not all – Gotcha Gotcha Games has begun publishing and distribution of PGMMV-developed titles on the Nintendo Switch. This means that not only will you be able to play your games on the Nintendo Switch, but distribute and sell them on the console, too!",
