    "About the game": "Planaris 2+, an enhanced version of the hit browser-based &amp; mobile game Planaris 2, is a new take on classic line-matching gameplay. Place polyomino shapes anywhere on the grid to clear lines(vertical or horizontal), earning powerups for multi-line clears. Watch out for pesky locks that spawn periodically and impede your progress! The game is over when you can't place any more shapes. This game is very easy to pick up and play with simple, intuitive mechanics that can be learned in 5 minutes... but deep enough to provide a challenge for those looking to master every level. Planaris 2+ has the following key features: 3 Classic game modes: Normal, Multiplier, and Survival A 'campaign' mode with a non-linear progression of over 50 levels with different shapes, sizes, and rules. 3 Different powerups to earn: Bombs, Line-Bombs, and lock-clearing Keys Planaris 2+ has several advantages over Planaris 2: Steam leaderboards Steam cloud saving All new levels available in campaign mode Better visual fidelity, fullscreen and 4k support.",
