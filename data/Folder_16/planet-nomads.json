    "About the game": "Planet Nomads is a singleplayer sci-fi sandbox game of survival on alien planets through block-style building. You are a lone astronaut scientist crash-landing on a strangely captivating planet. Keeping your wit together and securing your basic survival needs that include food, water and building material is the best start towards figuring out a way out of this messy situation. Planet Nomads delivers a unique gaming experience by combining building, survival and exploration together to make you feel like a true survivor. Building Building is the cornerstone of Planet Nomads. What you build determines your survival chances and increases your action radius. Building helps you to progress further and uncover advanced materials. Close to a hundred blocks await to let you create nearly anything your imagination can come up with. Exploration You may have explored your immediate surrounding, but a couple kilometers North or South, things are radically different. Multiple biomes cover the planet from pole to pole depending on the climate. Sandy engine blends the biomes naturally, making sure the journey to the North pole is an epic and everchanging adventure. Survival Surviving on an inhabited planet is no easy task, but with careful planning, caution and a healthy amount of curiosity, you can do it. As long as you overcome poisonous plants and curious beasts, avoid being slashed to pieces, frozen to death, eaten alive, starved and generally ended. Planet Nomads has been successfully Kickstarted, is now going through its Early Access, and it's being developed and improved together with our growing Nomadic family. You are most welcome to join us. How can a life of a Nomad look like? Day 17 Things have changed radically since my crash-landing. During the first days, I was hardly able to get food. Securing every meal was a life or death struggle back then, while now I have greenhouses to produce food for me. The planet felt strangely Earth-like at first, with atmosphere composition close enough to ours so that the suit filters have no problem processing it for me to breath. Then one day I saw a pack of creatures that looked like some kind of armored gorillas. I was watching them for a while when the biggest one saw me. It stood on its legs and started thumping its chest. I got the message loud and clear and quickly departed. Day 21 I have a good thing going. I started growing all of my food. I've built a rover and use it to collect resources from nearby mining spots I set up. It's beautiful out here, but it's not like I intend to settle down and grow old. I'm a building a much bigger version of the rover now. With some clever design choices I should be able to fit it with a generator, 3D printer and stasis chamber so it's all self-reliable and caring to all my needs. I intend to check what's beyond the horizon. Maybe there's a way out. Maybe there are other survivors out there. Day 26 There was an unexpected turn of events today. The armored gorillas paid me a visit. I don't think they like the mining machines that much so they came to tell me. I thought I could hide inside the base and wait it out, but the beasts started throwing huge rocks at the walls and the walls were caving in with a screeching noise all around me. I fired up the one mining machine I have in my base to serve as a distraction. Luckily enough I scheduled a test run of my new mobile base for this day. It was standing by all powered up and ready. I made a run for it, quickly got into the cockpit and got away this time. But there's no going back now. I'm a Nomad. Hundreds of stories like this await you in Planet Nomads. Come and survive your own.
