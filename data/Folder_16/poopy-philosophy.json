    "About the game": "Poopy philosophy is a game the first rule of which is to consider it being a part ove everybody's matter rather than a game. Fuzishe spends his time on a toilet reflecting on his past mistakes and his life in general. Why is he thinking about colous black? Smooth surfaces? Why are some people telling lies of this Earth? He's got used to thes soft toilet seat and the warmed floor under his feet. It is now November, and Fuzishe unconciously invites you to think with him. In Poopy Philosophy you will expirience a life of a man that sits on his toilet for a month straight. Help the protagonist finish all his stinky business and think upon such questions as...? Hold 'Space' to decide on the hero's fate, and at the end of a toilet day you will see Fuzishe's face which might be sad as well as happy Features: - Gameplay at your fingertips - Pixelated graphics - No music, Fuzishe doesn't hear that kind of stuff - Impeccaple surrounding sounds allow to fully dive into the protagonist's shoes - 30 November days each different from the previous - Many achievements, secrets and hats - More than one ending",
