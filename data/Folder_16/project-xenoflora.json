    "About the game": "100% of the plant life on earth was non-sentient, maybe scientists and giant corporations should learn to not mess with the laws of nature. In Project Xenoflora, you play the world's first biologically created sentient plant. Plants are cool, being able to think it cool, why not just combine those two things? Someone thought it was a good idea, it wasn't. Now there's a mildly dangerous and very angry plant making a mad dash for the exit, the only thing that stands in its way is the near-infinite number of mass-produced robot sentries programmed to destroy it. Features Burrow, shoot, and... tree?... your way through bullet-hell action in this short roguelike experience. Make use of randomized abilities and combine them to suit your playstyle. Most importantly, the enemies are all robots, the dog is a robot dog, specifically a chlorophyll-thirsty robot dog trying to tear you to shreds. Do not feel bad for the robot dog, it has red eyes its obviously evil. About Development This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
