    "About the game": "This terrible lizard is hot-pink with FURY! REPTOMOM is a ridiculous '80s-throwback platformer still under development, and it's awaiting YOUR valuable input to shape the final product. (It's also kind of close to being done!) Take your pick between a warm-fuzzies look if you miss your CRT television, or a more modern DirectX-looking deal. Enjoy SPC-inspired tunes that will make you think you're playing a Super Nintendo! Arm yourself with weapons like the Foot Cannon, Laser Tail, Flame Breath, and more, and fight your way through a rogues' gallery of warm-blooded criminals! Fly on robot Pterordrones and ride the woolly Murderdons across chasms of sheer spikey terror! Then talk to a Sloth for a breather! Collect coins to unlock original Concept Art, answering all the questions you never asked about the character designs! Blow past the score gates, complete the stages in 8 different areas, and go down in history as the OTHER Hero of Time. Hell hath no fury like REPTOMOM!",
