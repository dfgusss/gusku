    "About the game": "RODINA is a dream. A shared vision of a massive, seamless universe to explore. The perfect immersive space sim , where you can go anywhere, do anything, become anyone. I started RODINA because I suspected that no company could ever achieve this dream in a AAA way. I thought that perhaps a single developer, working over a long time frame, could eventually build something great. Join me on this adventure - try the DEMO and consider supporting further development! Rodina is made mostly by a single, obsessed developer - a 10-year veteran of the games industry who previously worked at Bethesda Softworks on Oblivion and Fallout 3 . You can always contact me at brendan@elliptic-games.com Current Features: Full-scale, completely seamless procedural solar system 4 full-size planets, 50 randomized major asteroids, something like 45,000 minor asteroids, and one enormous star! Xeno Bases Discover the Xeno Bases and Mines – interior spaces that are laid out, constructed, and decorated completely procedurally. FPS Combat Use your blaster, missiles, or powerups to handle half a dozen Xeno aliens Combat with alien ships Several different alien ship types, and 5 different weapon types, including heat-seeking missiles Customizable ship interiors Easily personalize your ship’s layout and share your design with other players A Story and Background fiction As told through books, emails, and logs Dynamic Soundtrack Over an hour of music, written by award-winning composer John Robert Matz Mod Support An open scripting system allows for mods that are simple to create, install and remove Future Vision: Over time, I intend to work on Rodina towards the direction of 'Daggerfall in Space' - a seamless procedurally-generated space RPG on a massive scale. Frankly, this is crazy! I can't make any promises about where or how long Rodina will go (and I ask you to buy only based on what you see here now), but I can promise to keep working on Rodina for as long as I'm able to. I'm committed to making Rodina great, and I hope that what's already released shows that I'm capable of delivering something different, vital, and fun . Please try the demo , and if you like what you see and pick up the full game, all your money will go towards Rodina's future development!",
