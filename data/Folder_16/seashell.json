    "About the game": "Relax at the beach and find every type of shell Each shell is different, pick up and examine the ones that catch your eye. Rare shells need certain conditions to appear, can you solve the mystery? Try to collect the biggest and smallest of each species. Enjoy our calming music system and wave ambience. Fill the pages of your journal Learn all about the creatures who lived inside the sea shells, in fascinating descriptions written by marine biologist and author, Dr Helen Scales. Discover lovely hand drawn shell sketches for every new shell you find. Even after you’ve found every shell, there is still a challenge Gain all 10 research level badges and become a Friend of the Sea. Unlock 10 fun achievements (they’re not just the research badges, we promise!) Playtime Seashell will take between 1 and 2 hours to fully complete. Though we understand there may be refunds, your time is more important than your money. We’re grateful you spent some of it with us. From the Team We’re a team of just two developers who wanted to try something different. Though Seashell is far from a huge game filled with features we’re very proud of what we’ve made. You can play our game for cheaper than a beachside fish and chips, and if you find it relaxing, interesting and fun, nothing would make us happier than to hear about it. Thank you so much for taking a look, and enjoy your time with the sea!",
