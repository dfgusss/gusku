    "Release date": "Nov 19, 2021",
    "About the game": "Shape Shift Shawn is a brand-new, episodic sidescrolling saga, styled with retro pre-rendered art that evokes the early 3D sidescrollers of the 90s, backed by a funky soundtrack (featuring veteran drummer G. Calvin Weston!) Each episode has 18 challenging levels and four dastardly bosses for Shawn to take down - a challenge worthy of any platforming veteran! The Story You are Shawn Maxwell, average 10-year-old boy. While out trick-or-treating on Halloween night, Shawn accidentally tumbles into a deep, dark hole, and discovers a twisted underground world populated with terrifying monsters out to have Shawn for lunch. But with the help of the friendly Muties, Shawn discovers that he now has the ability to shape-shift into powerful new forms. He'll need all the help he can get on this harrowing journey back home... The Transformations Shape-shift into four different forms! Each of Shawn's transformations has a unique gameplay mechanic to master... Spitfire Shawn - Breathe fire on your opponents, then take to the skies with your wings. Stretchy Shawn - Float like a balloon through dangerous passageways, or just blow your enemies away. Strong Shawn - Pulverize enemies (and the level itself) with raw, muscular strength! Sticky Shawn - Use slimy streams to stick to several surfaces! Crawl across ceilings and walls to cross dangerous chasms and discover hidden areas! The Story Continues... Episodes 2 and 3 will be released in 2022.",
