[what You Can Do] Collect Meat &amp; Feed Your Children; Muti-jump Between Bricks to Climb Higher; Push Boxes to Crush Enemies; Pile Boxes; Shoot Your Enemies. [story] So, What Is the story? Our main character is a jelly blob, a kind of slime. One day, a hero desiring for power comes to kill all slimes to raise up his level, so the slime has to find out all his children and protect them. Now You Have to Challenge Your Skills. Ps 1. As Time Passes Your Children Will Feel Hungry. 2. You can unlock the editor if you have collected enough coins. (This is the only way to unlock because there is no IAP in this game.) [how to Play] Use Left/right button to Move. Press E when you're next to a box or your child to hold it. Scroll mouse to magnify the scene to look around.",
