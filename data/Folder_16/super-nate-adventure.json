    "About the game": "Super Nate Adventure is a game about focused, tight platforming through challenging levels. Each new level with a different obstacle than the last, encountering new areas and new enemies to face along the way. The game has 12 levels that span across 3 unique worlds which have different sceneries, music and obstacles. Diamonds are placed throughout the world to guide you through each level, but keys are an extra difficult challenge usually requiring more work to obtain. Full controller support. Automatically detects connected controllers. Press to Jump or hold for a High Jump . Hold to Run , Tap to Pickup . Jump at max speed for a Super High Jump . Press Start to pause then Select to quickly exit to main menu. Umbreller is a basic enemy, jump on their head to destroy them. Cloudum is similar to the Umbreller but can float in the air. Volcanog shoots drops of lava from its volcano, it's too hot to jump ontop. Flitz is hot like the Volcanog, it flies in a wave pattern and passes through walls. Ball can be bounced upon but is too heavy to bounce off you. Spinner spins two lines of lasers around it's center, but can be stood upon. Death Block will instantly destroy you if collided directly. Diamonds and Keys are treated like a score, they must be collected in a single run. Diamonds and Keys can be collected separately from one another in different runs. Course obstacles have multiple approaches, try different strategies.",
