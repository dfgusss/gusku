    "About the game": "Important!!!! Fixed 'Error 0xc00007b' which happened on 64bit Systems!!! Party game for 8 players. Game is about fighting against opponents with tanks using various weapons. First player always play using keyboard where others can use joypads. Preferred are xbox pads. (Full support for all kinds of joypads is not guaranteed) You can fight in teams (from 2 to 4 teams) or deathmatch. Weapons are bullets, lasers and bombs. Players can collect bounses with different effects. To make tank temporary faster you have to press special button. Using speed depletes your energy bar. Energy bar is also used for firing laser so you have to decide what is more beneficient for you: laser or speed. Beta online play. ( To play online as server you need open internet port 45544 or change it) For now online play is only with keyboard. Important!!!! Fixed 'Error 0xc00007b' which happened on 64bit Systems!!!
