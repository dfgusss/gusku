    "About the game": "VR-specific Communication Puzzle Game Made for VR from the very foundations. ※ Notes 1: This is the prologue version. 2: The game begins by wearing HMD. Story A lone girl stands abandoned on a broken star. With the star deprived of its power, she can neither use it to escape nor inform others of her plight. However, there exists a point on this star that intersects with another world. The player, by standing on this convergence point and wearing the Otherworld-Viewing Device (VR unit), can enter the parallel world and communicate with the girl. Together, they cooperate to solve the puzzle of restoring the star's power so she may be able to leave. Character Game Concept Although sight is highly intuitive in VR, the same cannot be said for most other aspects, leading to irritation from clumsy controls. We designed this game around directing a character through glances to circumvent this and change that annoyance into a game element. Game Control Only the head-mounted display is needed to play. Optional Controls: For Oculus Touch: Toggle subtitles: Trigger button Toggle voice: Y button or B button Re-center: Grip button or adjust the display For VIVE and WinMR: Toggle subtitles: Trigger button Toggle voice: Use pad Re-center: Grip button or adjust the display Keyboard Toggle subtitles: S Toggle voice: L Re-center: R or adjust the display Saving/Deleting Data This game has an autosave feature.
