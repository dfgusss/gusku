    "About the game": "Monsters are attacking! Click to defeat them, save the village! Love Clicker/Incremental games? Inspired by Clicker Heroes, Tap Tap Infinity takes things to the next level with tactical Hero and Spell upgrades, an XP/Rank system, an unfolding story, fancy-pants 3d monsters and environments, endless gameplay, cross-platform cloud syncing and awesome graphics. Super-simple to play ... but with more strategic depth if you want it! Level up your Heroes so that they farm gold and search for the fabled Infinity Tokens, even while you're not playing! Earn XP by defeating monsters and clearing levels to unlock mighty Spells and gain a DPS bonus per Rank! Get to a high enough Rank and Ascend over and over to gain double the DPS bonus per Rank each Ascension. Find the Tokens of Infinity and trade them to the Guardians to unlock Powers. With 16 different Powers to choose from you can customize the game to play how *you* want it. 'Go Infinite' to restart at level 1 but with your Infinity Tokens multiplying your DPS so you can reach further and further into the game as you try to ultimately defeat 'The Master' ! Tap Tap Infinity is free to play and incredibly easy to get into: ★ Click monsters to kill them and collect their gold. ★ Hire the beaten Boss monsters to help you do extra damage as you level them up. ★ Your Heroes earn gold for you while you're not playing, even if the game is closed. ★ Find Valor Points and use them to Upgrade your Heroes, doubling how powerful their Skills are! ★ Gain XP and unlock Spells to auto-click, do more damage or even skip instantly between Boss levels! ★ Find Infinity Tokens to start all over again but with a permanent boost to your DPS. ★ Trade Infinity Tokens to The Guardians of Infinity for Powers that customize the game play or use them to upgrade Spells to make them more powerful. ★ Save your game to the cloud and keep playing on mobile! The game is already live on iTunes (4.5/5 star rating) and Google Play (4.4/5 star rating) . Looking to discuss the game or check in with the TTI community?
