    "About the game": "Build your party and venture forth to discover the secrets behind long abandoned, ancient cities; and decide where your own morality ultimately lies in this turn-based action strategy game. Choose a Seeker and Build Your Party Will you play as honourable Kai, the sceptical hunter Reina, confident Iris, gentle and selfless Momoko or Raul who favours fists over wits? It is on you to choose a Seeker to lead your party and assemble a team of characters all representing traditional RPG classes. As Ranger, Warrior, Mage, Brawler and Priest from both sides of the war work together and war continues to split the land, will camaraderie conquer all or will personal views rip your team apart. Make Each Fight Your Own Create your party from five different classes and dozens of playable characters each featuring their own upgrades and levelling trees. By combining hundreds of unique skills, you can ensure victory and due to the unique nature of your party members, you will never have to fight the same battle twice. Plan Your Strategy Combine abilities to create powerful combos against your foes or to negate the deadliest attacks. Try combining burn, freeze, stun, cripple and more to obtain your goals, and work with retaliation, redirects, immunities and more to halt the death of your heroes. You Decide Estera's Fate Decide your fate with a deep branching narrative and choice-driven decisions. Your actions may lead to an outcome which the world of Estera may not deserve. Should your party feature characters from all sides of the war, opinions may clash and it may not always be for the better ... The World is Yours to Discover Estera, a once proud and thriving world, now torn apart by war between its two large city-states: Tirig, the largest military in the land who praise the Gods, and the city state Helmgar, home to the Godless heretics to the north. Explore this stunning world and breathe in the beautiful hand illustrated locations. Venture deep into murky dangerous woods, roam vibrant busy towns and ransack long forgotten tombs, from the dizzying heights of Tower of The Ancients to the harsh lands of Arralash.",
