Have plenty of corridors to break up the raiders into smaller groups or make it through a deadly tough round trip. Set Traps Spears, poisoned darts or burning brimstone, trap your tomb with a variety of traps to stop the looters. Traps can be placed in any wall or ground, giving you no limitations in your strategic planning.

GO Let the raiders come, every enemy defeated and every round beaten gives you more resources.
