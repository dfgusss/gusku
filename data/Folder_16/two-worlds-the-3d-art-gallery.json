    "About the game": "The theme of the exhibition is values that affect everyone all the time. The society surrounding us defines what people appreciate. The paintings illustrate a reverse value system. This means, for example, showing poverty as something people admire and seek. The exhibition consists of 11 artworks. The gallery shows two very different worlds – the rich and the poor. Values are the key for solving various problems in a large scale and at the personal level. Cultures and societies will last if they implement the primary values that are truth, good, and beauty. The modern societies must change to avoid the eco-disaster.",
