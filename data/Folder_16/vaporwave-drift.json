    "About the game": "Hello, I am a personal developer who develops the games I want to achieve by continually learning programming knowledge. I have always wanted to develop a driving drift game with a retro cyber style. According to my idea, this game should have a simple drift system that makes it easy for players to play. So I spent a lot of time preparing and adjusting the driving control system in the game, making it easy to get started and easy to drift. This driving system is definitely different from the usual driving system, It is designed for fast drift. Please expect 'Vaporwave Drift' to be a single (no AI) driving drift game, It's fast, easy, tight, and repeatable, with elements of collection and challenges. In the game you can choose the track you like to drift and challenge the global leaderboard(Total Laps), or you just park your car on the side of the road and listen to the music. I am very grateful for the feedback and bug report. Thank you for taking a moment to read this, I really hope you enjoy this game. 1 playground map, 5 track maps. Custom graphics options, each map can adjust the bloom intensity or show/hide the UI. Two game modes, calculating time or not calculating time. Global Leaderboard(Total Laps). Reach the goal and unlock new car paint. Featured 4 retro music + 1 edm music. A driving drift game full of retro cyber ambience. Easy to learn driving drift system. The pace of the game is fast, and drifting in the world of retro cyber is addictive. Unlock more car paints. Let your high scores pay off in appearance. Steam achievements, leaderboard support! Steam cloud support, The fastest speed recorded and unlocked car paint will not be lost. Simple and easy gaming experience.",
