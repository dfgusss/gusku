    "About the game": "View From Below is a story-driven, turn-based RPG. You play as a struggling student called ASH who is captured by a mysterious presence, and taken to a scary, new world. You'll fight demons, solve puzzles, and unravel several horrifying mysteries, on your quest to escape it. Escape a nightmare world, to save your own. Fight exciting battles with a fun twist: lean left and right to EVADE enemy attacks! Defeat huge, epic bosses ! Solve dozens of puzzles and minigames ! Explore a strange world seeped in mystery, secrets, and hidden lore ! Experience a heartfelt story with multiple endings ! (Including a hidden 'true' ending.) Unlock a New Game+ mode with harder fights, and new reveals... Created almost entirely by one moron (me!) View From Below is a little bit dark, a little bit funny, and has quite a lot to say. It's inspired by games like Earthbound and Undertale, and movies like Donnie Darko and Alice in Wonderland. This game means a lot to me. I hope it'll mean a lot to you, too. LFOB Matthew Pablo",
