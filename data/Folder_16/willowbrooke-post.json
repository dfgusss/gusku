    "About the game": "Your parents leave unexpectedly, entrusting you with their beloved post office. With only a handful of coins and guidance from a family friend, you’ll need to manage finances, serve the community and protect the family reputation, until they return. The post office is a social hub for the village, and you’ll become a key part of the colourful community – one where each action could impact your relationship with the residents. Take on numerous tasks in the day to day running of the post office, including sorting packages for delivery, parcel wrapping, stamping letters, typing out emails, writing letters, and managing your ledger. Other activities around the house include checking in with community members on the phone as well as following a multitude of cooking recipes, to bake villagers delicious treats. As well as the day to day post office customers, you’ll also get to know a handful of familiar faces from Willowbrooke. These quirky characters include the gregarious Magnifique and your steadfast family friend Pete. Your actions, both in terms of how you interact with the residents of Willowbrooke, and how you decide to run the post office, will impact your relationship with each character. Deliver Magnifique’s camera as expected and they’ll be delighted. Take it for yourself instead, and you’ll witness a glimpse of Magnifique’s darker side. Learn more about the residents of Willowbrooke through the types of parcels they send, the letters they write, and how they react to your actions.",
