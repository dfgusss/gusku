    "About the game": "Content warning: This game contains niche fetish content. Before purchase, please read the description so you are not disappointed or unpleasantly surprised. Worshippers Of The Gain is an adult, furry, weight-gain visual novel. In WOTG, you assume the role of a visitor to a small town in the middle of nowhere. For reasons unknown, no visitors seem to stay small for long, and it's up to you to discover why... or just eat some burgers instead. Features Non-linear format Although more plot-centric locations unlock later, you're free to complete content in any order you like. Only plot-related events are timed, and you can pursue everything else at your leisure! Nine character routes! From Sofi, the masseuse muscle-wife, to Terry, the weary artist, there's every chance you'll find a character you like. An underlying mystery! Although the game is entirely at your own pace, you can discover clues that will allow you to unravel the town's secrets. Why is everyone so obsessed with food? How come nobody reacts to your peril? All this and more can be discovered... Seasonal events! The game shifts into Halloween and Christmas modes during real-world October and December. This introduces new content and characters to meet! Over 300,000 words of content! Containing a lengthy novel's worth of content, there's plenty to explore! Scene variants and dynamic character descriptions ensure that most scenes throughout the game will never quite be as you remember them! 99 endings! Aside from 28 'canon' endings, there are also 71 'bad' endings to discover, and these are tracked in-game for your convenience! Cheats menu! After completing the 'True ending', you can freely mess with settings and statistics in the town. This means you can pursue all the other content entirely at your convenience, and mess with the townsfolk while you do.",
