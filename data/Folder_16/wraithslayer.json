    "About the game": "Wraithslayer takes place in an abstract horror world where the player is bound to a single fight against a monstrosity known as a Wraith. Dodging the Wraith's relentless attacks while collecting orbs to weaken your foe will provide a nightmarish and challenging battle. Simple controls. There's only jump, dash, and dive. You'll have to be creative with your movement if you want to defeat the Wraith. Randomly generated attacks. The Wraith randomly picks from a wide array of moves to demolish you, making each fight very different. Dark silhouette art style. Explore the many ways you can die through the pulsating darkness of the Wraith and its lair. Multiple Game Modes. Normal, Endless, and True Wraith game modes provide varying levels of difficulty and high replayability.",
