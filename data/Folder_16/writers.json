Now there are two leagues: English and Russian. 22 unlockable characters. You can choose from 22 (or maybe there is more?) characters to become the fastest writer. But you have to try hard to unlock them all. Stats and Achievements. Each language league has its own statistic and leaderboards. You can watch the information about your CPM, Mistakes and other stats. Improve your typing skills. To win you will have to type without looking on the keyboard. Playing regularly you will be able to use Touch typing technic to be even faster. Then you can use it at your work, study.
