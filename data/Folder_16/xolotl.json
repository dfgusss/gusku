    "About the game": "An axolotl Action-Platformer! Earth had no sun, but the gods had a plan. Sacrifices were held, and the sun was created. But it was still. Movement was needed. And Xolotl was the chosen one. His sacrifice would make the sun move. The problem was, Xolotl didn't want to die. So he escaped to the mortal world, losing his godly form and powers. Now he wants them back. Xolotl is a tough, 2D Action Platformer! Travel the vast Aztec lands in the search of obtaining your godly powers, fight powerful gods and their henchmen, and befriend many animals! Jump and dash! Jump around different platforming challenges all throughout the different places in the Aztec lands! Swim! Swim in water found all around the world, jump in and out of water to gain speed! Become more powerful! Regain your stolen godly powers, and become the most powerful version of yourself you can be! Fantastic, dynamic movement, with tight controls. Modern Pixel-Art, with detailed backgrounds, colorful worlds, and modern lighting. Interact with sneaky snakes, loud lizards, and funny frogs. Encounter henchmen, godlings, and animals that want to kill you. Travel along a linear, yet open world. Everything is 'one big level', yet you'll always know where to go. An amazing soundtrack worthy of an amazing world.",
