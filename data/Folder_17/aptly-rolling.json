    "About the game": "In this game you must roll around in a wacky manner collecting shapes to increase your mass and eat other players. Compete for the top spot on the leaderboard! In order to eat a shape or other player you must be bigger than them. Watch out for spikes that will remove your mass! Features Roll around and pick up shapes (food) that move with you (cubes, spheres, pyramids, cylinders) Drop food on the ground for others after you have collected it Spikes that make the player lose mass on contact A leaderboard that shows the largest 10 players in the current lobby Large, semi-procedural map, food spawners, towers and spikes are randomized so that each server is somewhat unique In game lobby chat Incompetent bots Adjustable bot count (0-256) Adjustable max players per lobby (1-250) Colorful players Ability to get very large Multiplayer / Matchmaking To join a random open lobby simply click 'Join' on the main screen To host your own game, click 'Host'. Other players will be able to join as described above by clicking 'Join' You can invite and join friends using the Steam overlay.
