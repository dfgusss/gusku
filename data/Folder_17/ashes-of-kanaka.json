    "About the game": "Ashes of Kanaka is a story of humanity’s struggle to survive. After Earth has been completely destroyed by over harvesting and an unchecked population growth, we must look to the stars to find a new home. Our story begins several years after our first arrival on Kanaka, civilization has grown and cities and towns can be found on every corner. You awake in intensive care, under the watchful gaze of the Order of the All Seeing Eye, an organization dedicated to keeping humanity safe and strong no matter who may oppose them. You must protect humanity from CODE, a technology advanced civilization of androids, and TERRA, an ancient civilization that claims to have reached the echelon of godhood. As you begin your first investigation, you become aware of a greater galactic tournament where ownership of the planet is transferred to the winner. Humanity needs this victory, but it becomes apparent that whatever is actually on the planet, is worth entire species to give their lives for.  Ashes of Kanaka is made in a completely modded version of RPGMaker with custom coding and formulas made in house to push the engine to its limits.  60-100 hours of gameplay, and with New Game +; it exceeds all expectations in length for an RPGMaker game.  54 hand created companions to join you on your adventure----every companion will tweak how the story is presented.  An expansive world that covers most every biome in existence. From the snowy fields of Norda Morlone to the dark jungles of Kushmala, to the vast deserts of Hayphon. Every region is unique and fully fleshed out.  A comprehensive story that allows player choice, the player will decide the fate of not just individual actions, but as well the over-arching plot will be decided by how the player chooses to play.  Dozens of fully fleshed out side missions that take place across the entire world, filled with a story in their own right that develops the world around the player.  Fifteen different classes, each with three different weapon types for each. Along with the base weapons, the player will find legendary weapons for themselves and their party, which grow and can be customized to the player’s playstyle.  A fully custom musical score done by producers from The A-Team, who have worked with big names such as Nas and Future. Made by a team of fourteen dedicated video game fans who wanted to bring their passion to the industry. An effort of a year and a half round the clock dedication toward building a world for JRPG and traditional RPG fans alike. A few extra notes, Everyone at Dogwood Gaming is doing this because we love to make video games, purchasing Ashes is giving us support to build even more games in the future. We built Ashes of Kanaka to show the dedication and effort we could put into an engine that for the most part only produces 1-2 hour games. We hope you'll love Ashes, and we all hope you will follow us to see what we produce in the future, as we move towards the Unreal Engine! We are also selling the soundtrack to our game as an extra. We know you can access the music files in the windows version and just copy them from there, but if you wish to support our amazing musicians, and have the higher quality original files, the option to buy the soundtrack is here as well. Once again, from everyone at the Dogwood Gaming team, thank you for greenlighting us, thank you for supporting us, and thank you for #preventingtheashes!",
