    "About the game": "Hi! I'm a dad making games under the name of Dad's Indie Studio. Auri's Tales is a tiny game made with love and very few resources. I like to imagine that one day my daughter will play a little 3D adventure designed by his father and placed in a fantasy world which is based on her own life. Auri’s Tales is a 3D adventure in which players will need to find their way to the castle to complete the game. The whole game is contained in a one single level that players can explore and evokes to classic 3D platformer games. Jim Henson's Labyrinth, The legend of Zelda, Mario 64, Banjo Kazooie or Conker's Bad Fur Day are some of the influences that inspire this game in different ways.",
