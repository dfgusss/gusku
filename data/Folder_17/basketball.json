    "About the game": "Have you ever wanted to crush robots in an inflatable ball? To be a spaceship blasting debris? Or even, scandalously, be legally allowed to throw a basketball ? You can do all these things and more from the comfort of your very own home with your brand new copy of Basketball by Kitsch Digital, developers of Dropping Into Work and hosts of SCREAM ZONE game jams. You play as a kid who just wanted to spend the holidays hanging out with his friends, but whose father had other ideas. Whisked away on a tropical island getaway, you're left to kill time in the hotel's relaxation zone. Short But Sweet This game is only 20-30 minutes long ! Don't say we didn't warn you. Have Fun With Physics Throw basketballs at people! And also targets, hoops, and objectives I guess - but you can absolutely throw them at people. Exciting Minigames As if basketball wasn't enough, there are also other things ! Dark Undertones What really is 'virtual reality'? Is it dangerous and, crucially, can I eat it ? All valid questions you'll learn the answers to while playing. Summary Play a neat story-driven game. Experience 20-30 minutes of simple, fun gameplay. Play with a controller OR a keyboard! (We don't accept mice here) Engage cool minigames slotted into the flow of the game. Discover the answer to what 'virtual reality' really is (and if it's good on toast).",
