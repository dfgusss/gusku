    "About the game": "What you get: Sidescrolling. Base building. Tower defense. Army management. Survival. So many features in such a cute little package! Not convinced? Fine, have some more fancy words: Unlockable skins. Pixel art. Rabbits. Zombies. Skeletons. Other clichés. There, did that do the trick? No? Fair enough. The whole 'marketing your game' thing is not really my thing. Future plans (from a dude that is bad at planning): If this thing takes off, there are some features I'd like to add in the future. This is not a promise or a bribe, I promise. I personally want Xbox controller support, but people keep asking for WASD movement so you can play the game one-handed. What are you doing with that other hand, buddy? - Update 1.1 (Please note that some reviews might be from before this update) Added a tutorial Instead of throwing you in the deep like before, level one now features a short tutorial to get you familiar with the mechanics. Added story mode Intertwined with the gameplay you'll now experience a compelling story that spans across all levels. - Cheesy pun to end with: May the fur be with you. (Yeah, I'm not proud of that one.)",
