    "About the game": "Many thought Bubsy was lost to a legacy of shame obscurity after his cat-astrophic venture into 3-D, but he’s been given a new shot at video-game stardom with his first release of this meowllenium: Bubsy Two-Fur ! Bubsy Two-Fur is the authorized digital download version of Bubsy’s first two games, and the first official Bubsy release since 1997! Relive the games that started the notorious career of Bubsy Bobcat in their original incarnations, and experience for yourself the cat-titude and purr-sonality of the first gaming mascot to have a digitized (and unforgettable) voice, one whose words still resound in the minds of all who played his games: “What could paw-sibly go wrong?” Bubsy Two-Fur features: Faithful emulation of the SNES version of both games packaged together in a single executable, letting you relive the games in their original glory smoothly on modern machines.
