    "About the game": "In Ceramic Soul play as Yu, a porcelain doll made by the monstrous Mother to stand in for her estranged daughter. Explore her manor, discovering the history of these two characters by taking a close look at the environment and Mother’s chosen keepsakes. Detach your hand to reach previously inaccessible areas, solve puzzles, and pick up items to help you escape. Features Danger lurks around every corner as Mother patrols the manor, looking to return Yu to her rightful place. Solve puzzles by exploring, looking hints placed along the walls, and climbing through vents using your detachable hand. Some of the toys may not be as innocent as they seem, tread carefully... some of them might be watching. Keep your eyes peeled for paintings. The story of this family, and their tragic decline is all around you.
