    "About the game": "The king is having a huge birthday celebration! Five days of dancing, festivals, and drinking, culminating in a grand masquerade ball. It just so happens that Rivian Varrison, the introverted son of a famous nobleman, is forced to attend this giant event by his father. By chance, or maybe something more deliberate, he runs into a host of colorful and shady characters, all with their own stories to tell. But when a sudden and mysterious crime happens on the second day of the party, Rivian finds himself thrown into the middle of it, and has to discover the truth behind what really happened -- and who the people around him really are. Features: 125,000 words -- 12+ hours of gameplay 3 BxB romance options (+1 unlockable route!) 9 endings 30+ CGs Full English Voice Acting 14 track OST Windows/Mac/Linux/Android platforms For those unfamiliar with visual novels, they are primarily 2D narrative-based games that present the user with important choices that alter the story's path. For Chess of Blades, mystery and intrigue are a central part of the story, but there are also three prominent romance routes that significantly change the later portions of the game.
