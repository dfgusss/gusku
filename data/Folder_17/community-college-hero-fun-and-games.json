    "About the game": "It’s the calm before the storm. Savor every moment of these light-hearted adventures with your superpowered classmates; these may be your final moments of levity and joy before the Diabolical Dozen crushes the world’s heroes beneath its collective heel. But for now, there are small-town monsters to discover, fantasy creatures to battle, and visits from your mother to survive. Community College Hero: Fun and Games is a 108,000-word superpowered interactive novel by Eric Moser. It’s entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Set during the fall and spring semesters of your first year at Speck Community College, Fun and Games includes three all-new adventures with an emphasis on comedy, friendship, and exploring fresh settings with nary a superpowered villain in sight! Play as male, female, or non-binary. Romance any of seven different classmates. Just answer a few questions and you’re off! No saves from Community College Hero Parts 1 or 2 are required. Join your classmates in an epic tabletop fantasy adventure with bandits, elves, ogres, and even a wyvern! Will you become a champion known throughout the realm or die penniless and forgotten? Create your own custom fantasy character and use real die rolls to determine your success or failure! Help your friends investigate the legend of the lake monster. When the creature starts terrorizing Hay Springs, Nebraska, can you figure out who’s behind the mayhem before it’s too late? The mystery can be played numerous times with different results; the game generates different culprits! Dean Tolly invites everyone’s loved ones to visit campus, and it’s just as embarrassing as you might imagine! Do you try to win the day’s activities, appease your mother, or learn more about your classmates? The Dean might just have a secret plot - will you figure it out in time? Earn up to 47 Achievements, three of which unlock short stories featuring Crook, Stoic, and Dr. Hover. Enjoy fun and games with your friends at Speck Community College!",
