You were dropped into the wrecked world as a Dark-Hunter, the last remains of elite human soldiers. To survive, you need to equip yourself, fight through your way, collecting ‘shards’ from killing super nature creatures to reinforce your energy. Through surviving, you will explore the mysterious dark zones, kill, gain, get stronger and find the way to seal the Dark Void and save the world from doom. FEATURES Cinematic quality graphic, detailed characters and environment design, vivid animation with lush visual effect. Fast-paced action, challenging Souls-Like combat system. You must time your attacks, use your dodge and parry the enemy for maximum damage. Use your weapon’s special attacks, drone skills, or air combos to defeat your enemy in different situations. Explore a dynamic world with ever-changing enemies, temporary power-ups totems that change each time you play through them. Acquire new drones through Factions, and bosses unlock your skill tree to grow permanently stronger. Take on nightmarish enemies and epic bosses from cyborgs to dragons throughout dark zones to get precious loot and upgrade materials you can use to customize weapons, drones, and character upgrades in multiple ways.

Seek powers in an Underground city left by the ancient builders, battle your way through gruesome castles made of flesh. Descend into machine temples buried deep in The Great Swamp in search of your own existences. Encounter horrifying supernatural enemies, fearsome bosses. Uncover the story and discover side quests. Meet mysterious characters, Join a Faction, earn their trust by doing Quests, and gain unique skills to defeat their rivals or kill them all.
