    "About the game": "The tension is thick. Your pursuers have caused you a lot of damage and if they find you now, they'll take everything you've worked for. You'll need to get one of the airplanes working to leave the island, but right now your priority is to find some food or you'll be too depleted to defend yourself. From your vantage point in a second floor window, you spot a deer cautiously emerging from a grove of trees near the bottom of a wooded hill. Deer can be hunted for food, so you raise your weapon and put your crosshairs over the animal's heart. You are about to pull the trigger when you see the deer start, then run off. You pan your scope to the side and see that the deer was startled by the group of heavily armed players that are now approaching your position. It's a posse, and although they don't know exactly where you are, they know you're in the area. The Death Toll will be high today… Come join an open world first person survival shooter with a unique game mode that focuses on team play. Explore a beautiful open world as you search for the supplies and equipment you will need to escape from the island and win the game. Find weapons to hunt the ones closest to escape, or use your tactical skills to turn the tables on the ones pursuing you. Can you win the arms race and leave the island with your life, or are you doomed to be left behind and die with the other captives? Weapons Death Toll includes a wealth of modern firepower like assault weapons, RPGs and grenades, along with defensive measure like camo clothing and body armor. The only problem is finding them before your competitors do! Combat Vehicles Scattered around the island are an assortment of land, sea, and air vehicles. Many, like the tanks or the jets, have working weapon systems. Acquiring one of these vehicles will greatly boost your chances of success, but to use one you'll first have to repair it with the parts and materials you find scattered around the island. Survival You'll need to find food if you want to survive. Canned food is available if you can find it, but the best way to keep yourself fed is to hunt. The island is home to deer, rabbits, fox, and boar, all of which can be taken for food.
