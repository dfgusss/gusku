    "About the game": "Think of Downtown Drift as pac-man, but as a first-person racing game. You need to try and score as many points as possible by drifting while police is chasing you down. Each drift gives you a certain amount of points and also increases your multiplier. The higher the multiplier, the more points you get for each drift. However there is a catch: you only have limited health and you take damage everytime you crash, so watch how you move! Features Fast pace racing with thrilling police chases Realistic car destruction Global Highscore Ranking to compete with friends and players around the world Development Updates Join the Community Group and Discord Server and follow on Socials for Updates on the development process!",
