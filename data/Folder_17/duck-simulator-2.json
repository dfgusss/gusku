    "About the game": "Duck Simulator 2 is a genre-defying game where you will hop between different games in an attempt to find an evil rubber duck that is attempting to ruin the developer's game! You'll begin by quacking your way through a clicker game, but before you know it the rubber duck will go rogue and completely destroy it! From there, the developer will create several different games (each with a varying genre) for you to complete while they try to find out what went wrong with the original game. So one moment you may be shooting red capsules, but in the next you could be hopping between islands whilst trying not to fall into the void! Features Four different types of games within the campaign Includes a remaster of the original Duck Simulator An original soundtrack Completely free",
