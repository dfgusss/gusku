    "About the game": "Come play the new-and-improved version of Dust to Dusk on Steam! Game Overview: Set in a modern Japanese office, this horror-inspired adventure title employs the unique Zapping system, which allows you to play the story from the point of view of multiple characters. Although zapping isn't required to reach the game's true ending, it does fill in plenty of gaps and will help you better under each character's motivation. There are four different endings, with three 'non-true' ending that conclude with a staff roll. Try and find them all! Although it is a horror game, there are no chase sequences, no jump scare-type images, or game overs. Play the game and take in the after-office atmosphere at your own pace. Story: Rumors are abound at the Tsukimiya Corporation about a child ghost that wanders the office halls. In fact, the hushed whispers and paranoia have grown so readily that the office now shuts it doors promptly at seven o'clock each night--the same hour this child comes out to play. One night, Jun Tsukimiya, the corporation's chairman, oversleeps at his desk and is left alone on the cusp of dusk. And what does this child say to him when they finally meet? 'You know nothing, Jun Tsukimiya.' Just what is it that he doesn't know? Whatever it is, the clock is stuck at seven, and he has little choice but to find out.",
