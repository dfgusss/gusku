    "About the game": "With the break up of the Superpower blocks, colonial wars ravage the world. The development of powerful beam weapons and defensive energy shields have revolutionized ground warfare giving a new lease of life to the concept of the Armored Fighting Vehicle. Propulsion systems have advanced beyond recognition. The development of the GRAV engine means tanks can skim across a battlefield at the speed of todays helicopter gun-ships. FIREZONE simulates this new style of combat. It can be played as a solo game against a tough computer opponent or as a two player game. The player can control either of the two main protagonists - the EUROPEAN LEAGUE or the PACIFIC COMBINE - in any of the set scenarios. Victory is yours when the opposing forces are either wiped from the map or forced into mass retreat. Also incorporated is a scenario editor program allowing the player to design his own battles. FIREZONE is a phased game and incorporates the latest in Artificial Intelligence techniques. Features Phased game Highly intelligent computer opponent 9 pre-set missions on disk Unique scenario generator Hidden or open movement 1 or 2 players Multiple terrain types Hex based scrolling maps Variable unit types",
