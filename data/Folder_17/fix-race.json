    "About the game": "Fix Race is a fixed screen car racing game, top down with isometric view. The game uses a very simple driving system, where you just need the touch of a finger or mouse click to correct the trajectory of your car. In each race you will have to challenge 1 to 4 opposing multiplayer cars. You will take part in a world tournament, divided into categories, in which players from all over the world take part. You can view the world ranking with the relative scores of the players. When you pass a category you will get a gift (for example new scenarios or new game modes or other). You can personalize your avatar and your car. Win and unlock many mods. The game uses a modern and pleasant 'low poly' graphic.",
