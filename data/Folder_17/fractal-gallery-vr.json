    "About the game": "About Gallery of fractals in virtual reality. A cozy place in which you can relax from everyday life looking at the beauty of mathematics. What's inside - 100 static images of fractals. - 40 dynamic images of fractals. - Hidden secrets. - Meditative soundtrack. The gallery is constantly changing, so you can always find something new. Let the Fractal Gallery become a part of your VR-universe. Support and updates I plan to actively support this project after launch. There are some interesting ideas that I plan to implement. Also over time, I plan to add new content: new fractals, environmental details, objects, and hidden secrets. The project is based on UE4. Therefore, I plan to add support for new VR devices and improve the graphics.",
