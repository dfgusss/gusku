    "About the game": "Frak! is a classic retro platform game from 1984, now completely rebooted for the 21st century! Armed only with his trusty yoyo, our caveman hero Trogg has to collect all the keys to complete each level: but watch out for the Scrubblies, Poglets, and Hooters! Though the original game had only three levels, this new version has fifty five , featuring tons of extra features: -- moving meanies -- vertical scrolling levels -- moving platforms -- movable platforms -- bouncy platforms! There are five difficulty settings, and one hundred Steam Achievements! A genuinely classic game!",
