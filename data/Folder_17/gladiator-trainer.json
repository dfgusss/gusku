    "About the game": "In the ruthless world of the Crownlands, which is ruled by the One True Queen, it has never been easy for someone of low class to rise above their place in the caste system society. Even now, with the realm recovering from a great war and the alliances between the great eight dominions more fragile than ever, there is little that a commoner can do to make his mark on this chaotic world. Except, perhaps, through the prestige of the arena. This will be your route to power and glory. Use your wits, your wealth, and your warriors to build a team of gladiators that will allow you to rise in status from the lowest drinking dens to the queen's royal arena. You are given a run down estate that you must restore in order to properly train your fighters. Along the way you will encounter travelers that will offer to improve your fighters stats. Some may even try to convince you to rally against the queen. Will you protect and unravel the conspiracy against her or will you join the rebellion to take the Crownlands away from the Queen? Along your journey, you will need dancers and weapons trainers to build your fighters into an experience fighting army. Armories are available to customize your gladiators weapons and armor. Prized maidens will be looking for a proper suitor to marry and will offer large amounts of money through dowries to help fund your empire. Be careful who your allies are and be wary of anyone you do not know. Can you become prestigious enough to be the Champion of the Crownlands? Can you build a gladiator empire that stands the test of time?",
