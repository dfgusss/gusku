    "Name": "Heart Chain Kitty",
    "Release date": "Nov 23, 2018",
    "About the game": "A new adventure begins when a heart-shaped stranger arrives on Kitty Island, bringing very personal news: Kittey’s parents are missing! As Kittey searches for them, he must face what remains of a broken world soon approaching its very end ... From Kitty Island to the City of Cyclopia – through a huge comet-struck desert and the deepest pits of Darkside – Kittey's big journey may lead to some uncomfortable truths. Now, remember: Even if the walls of reality are crumbling and the line between dream and waking life are blurred – everything will be just fine! Make sure to keep collecting those strange Power Hearts that litter the world, though. If you get enough of those, you'll surely win! Right? About Heart Chain Kitty Heart Chain Kitty is a big 3D platformer adventure with a few twists. If you like collect-a-thons like Banjo Kazooie or Mario Sunshine, this is the game for you! This is a continuation of my freeware game series “A Game with a Kitty”. The game features inventory items that can be used to interact with the world or its inhabitants, along with optional quests and hidden levels. The way forward isn't always going to be collecting this game's version of MacGuffins … but it'll probably help if you collect them! Nothing wrong with that! Kittey can jump quite well, but he'll get additional moves quickly. There's the Hat Glide, the Power Glove (Good for punching people in the face) and its Screw Ray upgrade, giving you a way to dominate screws and bolts all over the world! Later on, you'll even ride bottle rockets and do tricks using the Zoom ability. Don't forget to buy some strength-enhancing cakes from your nerd bro – and maybe some of Darling's life hearts. You'll need 'em! Some Features Neatly Arranged in a List Explore more than 40 levels. Visit large, surreal, and colorful worlds. Get around using a variety of Kittey’s abilities – like a bottle rocket, zooming, launch rings, swimming, pole-climbing, and more! Jump between dimensions and complete additional challenging 2D levels. Complete quests and collect items. Try to unlock the multiple endings, secret levels, and hidden bosses!",
