    "About the game": "Trapped within the offices of a large hedge fund called Sipadel Finance. It's your job to take a sip and make the apes dip. Hedgie simulator is a satire/joke perspective of how hedge funds operate. As the player, you work as a hedge fund manager trying to make the big bucks. This is a clicker game where you will click to short stocks until you are able to unlock auto-clickers. This game is for all intensive purposes a satire depiction of Hedge Funds. Depicting them as not having a clue on what they are doing. The simplest way I could think of doing that was with a Clicker Type game. In this game you will short stocks by slowly and rapidly clicking the short button which in turn will generate cash. You can then use this cash to upgrade your shorting position or buy auto-shorters to make money passively. Game Features: Short Sell Why buy your own shares? when you can just barrow someone elses? This is the age old question, hedgies ask themselves as a quick way to double their money. Short stocks by clicking. The faster you click the more you short. Chance Chests Lucky or unlucky random events used by open one of three chests. This could aid you or hinder you on your path to Hedgie Glory. Naked Short The market price getting too high for your liking? Just naked short it. Watch everyone dip while you sip on a nice cup of coffee. Allowing your shorts to profit. Doubling your auto-shorting income for a limited time. Deploy FUD You ever think social media was a mistake. Watching communities work together to grow a stock, well now you have a solution. Just deploy FUD. Maybe pay off a few News stations, some articles here and there. And well if that doesn't work just pay the retail investment platforms off. Have them block new buy orders. Use this option to click those shorts at a double rate!",
