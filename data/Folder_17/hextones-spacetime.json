    "About the game": "Hextones: Spacetime continues the addicting puzzle challenge from its predecessor. Connect the Hextones and jump on a journey through Spacetime! An even more challenging matchup puzzle with time mechanics . Explore three new Hexgrids through three game modes, including a Hardcore for those with a strong heart and a Relax mode with cool music! Spacetime: Be fast before the current Hextone goes to the end of the queue. Hardcore: If you lose your time to place an Hextone, it will be destroyed forever. Relax: No time pressure, just play like the first Hextones game, with relaxing music. There are 25 unique Hextones formed by a combination of colors and symbols, and a total of 100 Hextones to be placed onto the grid. Place the Hextone onto the grid by connecting one or more of its edges to one or more Hextones already placed on the grid. As more connections in a move, more points, but don't forget to complete the current Tier to increase the connections bonus. NEW: Now you can see the next three Hextones, and swap between them before placing. NEW: Hextones are unstable during this journey, if don't play any Hextones during the available time, it vanishes to return back later. NEW Time Freeze mechanic: Complete a Tier or a six-edges connection to earn a Time Freeze usage, and then slow down the Spacetime to have more time to think in your strategy. ENJOY A NEW OPTIONAL AUGMENTED REALITY EXPERIENCE WITH THE TILT FIVE™ SYSTEM! Tilt Five™ is a new tabletop holographic gaming system. With Tilt Five™, players can see New VFX in 3D space for each kind of connection. Also, the Stars from the Archive can now be viewed in 3D with a nice look. The UI is adapted for the board size to have a more pleasant experience. There are 3 control modes for the Tilt Five Wand: Line, Arc, and Stick.",
