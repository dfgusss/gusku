    "About the game": "JETBOUNCE JETBOUNCE is a platformer and exploration game where you collect items to unlock new levels, unlock abilities and power-ups. A Collect-A-Thon where you fly, jump and bounce in non-linear levels. Which engine will you choose? Power Mode: ludicrous speed but hard to control. For an exciting experience. Flow Mode: slower but smoother, easy to control. For a more relaxing experience. For the fans of old-school platformers from the N64 era. Fly, Jump, Bounce Hold a button to fly, release it to get launched where you are aiming. Bounce around and use your momentum to fly high like a rocket! ...or fall like a heavy cauldron. Speed and momentum are a double-edged sword. The faster you go the longer your jumps, but the harder it is to control. All levels are handcrafted to reward exploration and mastery. JETBOUNCE is hard and you can get stuck. But don't give up, you will reach the top. Join us on Discord!",
