    "About the game": "It is a 2D platform casual arcade game that succeeds when you step on a block from the ground and reach the moon. Will you be able to go up to the moon? ◉ It is a success if the character steps on the block to avoid various obstacles and climbs up to the final destination, the moon. ◉ There's no save point. In other words, if you fall, you may have to start all over again. Be careful not to fall. ◉ This game is quite difficult. If you cleared this game, your game physical would be great. ◉ It was abbreviated from Earth to the actual moon. ◉ As the altitude increases, the terrain and obstacles change, and accordingly, the characteristics of the terrain change.",
