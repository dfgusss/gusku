    "About the game": "Life Forge is a Free 2D Online RPG. Take part in this sprawling adventure as you explore a massive world, gather resources to craft gear, engage in PvE and PvP, and buddy up with your friends to conquer end-game bosses! With lovingly made custom art, a variety of fun and engaging features, and the heart and soul of a tight-knit community, Life Forge promises to be a game to remember! Life Forge is an ORPG designed to be what you make of it. The story is simple, you are found unconscious along a shore line by an elderly man who leads you to his home for shelter. While there, you soon realize that you have no memories and the world in Life Forge is all new to you. From here on, your life is whatever you want to make of it. A Life Forge, if you will. In the world of Life Forge there is a lot to do and be a part of. You can become a great and powerful hero or, if you wish, a villain and take part in quests, exploring dungeons and have PvP battles in arenas. If you decide that you don't want to run around and take part in adventurous deeds then you won't have to. There are a lot of different resources scattered around Life Forge for you to harvest that you then can craft into useful items such as weapons, tools and armor. All of which you can either use for yourself as an upgrade or sell to other players on the auction house or through trading. Use mounts to travel faster! Different mounts will travel at different speeds and there will be several to choose from. When your character dies, you will have 60 seconds to either wait and be revived by another player or respawn back at your last check point. Use materials that are in your inventory to craft items and gear! Crafted items will generally be better than what you would find at a shop. Each boss is created with custom mechanics for a unique and more enjoyable boss battle, so expect a challenge! Your character will gain threat when in battle! Be prepared, enemies will attack the fighter with the most threat first. There are also taunt skills to increase your threat even more, for those who feel bold anyways. Keep track of your quests and your progress with the quest log. You can track the quests by clicking on them and they will be pinned to the game screen for easy tracking. There are three different skill trees to apply talent points to, giving you the chance to make your character into a unique and fun experience. Items have weight and your character has stamina. The more weight you're carrying the less stamina you will have which will cause your character to move slower. Stamina can be raised through strength and endurance. And of course we have all the basic needs of an ORPG...
