    "About the game": "Save the planet, become a hero, stop sucking! Shinji, your generic protag-kun, who doesn't even have any artwork is forced to become the hero he'd always dreamed of when his friends Izumi and Kiyoko (who are far funnier than he is) find a mysterious pendant that happens to belong to an angry group of space pirate aliens. Experience an alien invasion, young love, and so many exams, in this hilarious comedic visual novel. FEATURES Gorgeous hand drawn CG and background artwork! Partial voice acting from a talented cast! A brand new OST inspired by the future bass and lo-fi hip hop genres. It's good. Achieve greatness! (This game has achievements and one is called 'Greatness'. You can achieve it.) Stacy and Gwinnifer. CHARACTERS Main Character Main Character Simulator is a story following Naota, a boy whose suburban life is disturbed by the arrival of the alien woman... No, wait, that's not right! Wasn't it Taro-kun? Izumi Izumi is your classic genki girl, fun, sporty, full on energy, and in desperate need of the study group you're in together. Kiyoko Kiyoko is a kawaii amateur scientist, who puts up with you on a regular basis. Erodani Commander Erodani commands her own starship! How cool is that!? She also recently had on-demand television installed. Mira Mira is Erodani's assistant, who puts up with too damn much, and gets paid too damn little. Hey! Thanks for getting all the way here. You're thorough. Have a cookie. I hope you enjoy this 3-4 hour fun little visual novel.",
