    "About the game": "In this turn based RPG for Windows you play as a young mercenary and travel from soul to soul to avenge your fiance and her family. While finding a way to change the flow of past events, you will encounter many obstacles and meet new allies. Will you be brave enough? This game aims to revive nostalgic moments for good old RPG fanatics (such as Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 3...). Our game has no game over screen; once the hero dies, his soul is sent to the underworld, to meet the Soul Giver. At this point, it is possible to re-embody a new body (therefore several choices of classes: Warrior, Assassin, Mage, Hunter ...). In addition, once a character masters a technique, it is learned permanently in the mind of the hero. It is therefore possible to transfer a warrior's ability to a magician. This leads toward interesting gameplay combinations. What makes the game unique and fun to play: - Dark, mysterious and ever-changing storyline - Unique class &amp; death system - High replay value. - Various treasure hunting. - Easy crafting system If you are a fan of old good RPG games, this one is surely for YOU!",
