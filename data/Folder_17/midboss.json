    "Release date": "May 25, 2017",
    "About the game": "Kill your enemies, possess their bodies, and take their abilities as your own in this turn-based procedurally generated death labyrinth. You play as the imp, the weakest monster in the dungeon. Tired of being bullied by the other monsters, you set off with your sidekick Mid to descend to the deepest levels of the dungeon, defeat the final boss, and take his place. MidBoss is easy to pick up and play if you're new to the genre of traditional roguelikes (turn-based strategic RPGs with permadeath), but still has the depth and complexity that veterans expect and enjoy. Features Possess your enemy and gain their strengths and skills with over 60 unique abilities to discover and learn. Choose between Hardcore mode (only 1 life), 1UP mode (5 lives), and Narrative mode (infinite lives and buffs to explore the game) Randomized potions every game. Who knows what's in these mystery bottles! (optional) Traps as well as unidentified and cursed items. Dynamic music system that ups the musical excitement when enemies are about. Custom Games so you can play the game exactly the way you want to. Shareable death cards document your run and how it ended. Load these in the game for stats or to play using the same seed and settings. Customize your cards with unlockable themes! Spend death cards to start your next run with items you had when you died. Beat the game and get a special card which unlocks a new game+ mode. Start over with your items, abilities, or both! Lots of crates, chests, and other containers to pillage. Find the royal chest that spawns on every floor for extra sweet loot! Playable with mouse and/or keyboard. Pick whatever control scheme you like! Color-blind modes, optional high contrast font, and adjustable brightness. Multiple monitor support and borderless windowed fullscreen. 12 retro mode filters to find and unlock. Cratefish.",
