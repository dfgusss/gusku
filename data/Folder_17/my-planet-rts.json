    "About the game": "Continuation of End War RTS, New Play Instant Game My Planet is a mixed story of abstract science fiction and fantasy. It uses modern science fiction weapons as operating units and aims at exploring the underground world. The protagonist of the story, the Devil King, has fought thousands of galaxies and invincible war machines in the Star River Universe. It dominates the planet where players live, human beings and alien activities. Players can choose races. It can be said that it is very difficult for players on this planet to win battles with enemies and to deal with the army of the Devil King at the same time. In order to win, players need to develop metal and uranium mines in large quantities. Inevitably, they need to enter the underground world. The army of the Devil King of the underground world guards their territory. Players need powerful troops and positions to defend. Without the most powerful weapons, the underground world is very difficult to survive, so they need players. To occupy the most powerful technological city in the upper world, we can build powerful weapons after occupying the city. With powerful weapons, the underground world will be challenged, and the devil will be inferior in front of Atlantis. There is a shortcut that is to use energy, which can call out powerful weapons, or add resources to our side. Planting can exchange energy for wine, energy can also dig enough mineral resources for exchange, which is suitable for the situation of many mines. Building Atlantis is a very long-term thing. Atlantis is a flying city with powerful urban technology and combat effectiveness. It needs a certain number of eight components to build, which means more mineral resources are needed. Introductory points of the game: The world is divided into multi-layers, surface layers and multiple subsurface layers. The more minerals are decomposed into the subsurface, the higher the resources are, the more monsters are at the bottom, and the more powerful they are. Each layer has holes in the upper and lower layers.
