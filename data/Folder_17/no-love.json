    "About the game": "Agro awakes in his towns sanctuary and decides to leave his life behind to go on an adventure. He then sets out to try and stop the being Darkness who wants to destroy the world. This game is unlike any other game that you’ve ever played before and is a once in a lifetime experience! But, I want to be clear that this game is not for everyone. Please look at the description of content below. Features: - Completely original story, where you probably won't know where it's going to go next! - Character-rich story where the game is really about the characters and their journey. - Text heavy game. - No grind imho! Like, literally just walk to where you need to go and you should be the right level. - Tons of jokes made from Wallace Lovecraft himself. - Completely original handdrawn art, all done by Wallace Lovecraft! - Amazing soundtrack with songs made by lovely people! - I would say that it's a casual game and it's pretty forgiving. - 2 choices matter adventure games within the game with multiple endings in both! - Save “pretty much” whenever you want! - Can be played with one hand! - Created by one person, Wallace Lovecraft, except the music! - Action packed with tons of fighting and blood and stuff. - Art, art, art, so much art, like seriously so much art. So exhausted arting all the time, so much art. - That's all that I can think of right now, take care, farewell, bye bye, kiss kiss!",
