    "About the game": "PropHunt is a game in which you have to become a prop or a hunter. The props are disguised as objects around the map and merge with the environment. The props are trying to hide from the hunters and avoid death. Hunters win the round if all props are killed, and props win if the time runs out or all hunters die. If you Prop: you should hide from hunters. To do this, take the form of any item that is present on the map. If you are a Hunter: you must search and kill props. For this you have a weapon. But hurry up - you have limited time!",
