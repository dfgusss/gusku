    "About the game": "PLUNGE INTO THE OCEAN OF DARKNESS Third-person non-VR VR Radiant Crusade is a stylized fusion between exhilarating car combat and high intensity tower defense action. Survive the onslaught of creatures fighting to expel you from the realm of darkness by taking control of a versatile vehicle giving you unshackled locomotion and a powerful arsenal of upgradable abilities. Travel at time warping speeds and annihilate enemies in a single blow using the Charge. Leverage the Charge's 'Hyper Time' effect to move through time faster than enemies. Utilize tracking Missiles to slow and blast enemies into oblivion. Upgrade missiles with the ability to slow time for each enemy hit! Deploy Time Bubbles to draw enemies into a time void, in which they seize to a halt upon entry, while taking damage over time. Knock back enemies with a powerful AOE blast using the Shotgun How to play!? In VR, the game is played in the first person perspective, from a cockpit inside the car. In Non-VR, the game is played from the third-person perspective, behind the car, with full orbit camera controls. The player drives across a sandbox sized world to combat enemies coming from often distant places, each moving to the center, where the tower is located, and defending itself from. After each level, expend the increasing amounts of energy to unlock powerful upgrades, using a vast skill tree. Survive through as many levels as possible, fighting increasingly powerful and varied enemies.",
