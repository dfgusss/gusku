    "About the game": "People that had tragic lives or deaths can sometimes stay trapped in the mortal world. They become beings of pure hatred that only wish for others to suffer the same fate they did. Only those who manage to understand them can free them. Remnant Records is a horror investigation game for 1 to 4 players , in which you are the newest recruit of an agency that deals with these paranormal matters. You will be sent to places that have been reported as haunted, and your job will be to cleanse them of undead presences with the help of your team. To exorcise a spirit, you first have to understand it. Search the place and find the clues left behind : diaries, newspaper cuts, unusual objects. Understand the person this spirit was, and gather as many items that are closely related to it. Once you're ready, all you've got left to do is start the exorcism and pray you've understood everything correctly... and survive until the ghost is freed from this world. Procedural contracts that tell a new and fresh story to decipher with every mission. Unique and terrifying ghosts , that differ vastly in both appearance and behaviors. Encounter the mannequin that takes advantage of light and shadow to catch you off-guard, the blind runner that will find you if you make the slightest noise, and many other horrifying spirits. Four different roles that can make every player have a strong impact on the mission. Play as the musclehead that can break down doors, or as the medium that has a close connection with the world of the dead. Cooperative gameplay with up to three friends (or strangers), complete with ingame proximity voice chat. Ghosts also have unique abilities that only appear in multiplayer. Level up and unlock multiple features, such as customizable difficulty levels, and modifiers that will make every game a new experience. Set the difficulty of the ghost and of the investigation separately and make the game fit your playstyle. Become an experienced ghost hunter through your missions, getting new knowledge as a player and filling your exorcist diary with strategies to survive the next contract.",
