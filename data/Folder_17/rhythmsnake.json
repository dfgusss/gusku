    "About the game": "Stay on beat to make your snake twist and turn, score combos, and increase the points you get for collecting food! The snake’s speed adapts to the rhythm of the game in real time, so be careful and don’t miss the beat on a turn. Every new piece of music from your device is its own unique level where you can gain points for eating food and set higher, cooler records. The four difficulty levels mean you can fine-tune the experience to make sure the game is fun for new and experienced players alike. You can play with family and friends on the same device: in split-screen mode, like in the good old days, or together on one board! Combining Two Genres—Snake and Rhythm Games. Simultaneous play for up to 5 players! Default music.",
