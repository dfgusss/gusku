In Russian Subway Dogs it’s up to you to use your knowledge and abilities to stuff your stomach and inflict as much mayhem as possible! Musician Peter Chapman (Guacamelee!, LittleBigPlanet Karting, Modnation Racers) has created a banging original soundtrack packed with Slavic sounds and Baltic beats combined with electronic dance music.",
