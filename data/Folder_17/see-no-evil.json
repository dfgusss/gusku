    "About the game": "See No Evil is a dark, isometric puzzle game about sound manipulation. A harsh fantasy where the willingly blind are hostile to the nonconformist. Sometimes, the world seems darker with your eyes open. Become a Seer and explore the beautiful, mind bending, twisted fantasy that is the world around you. Guided only by a journal left in your decaying prison, and opposed by an army of those afraid of what they don't understand, you seek to learn why the world went dark. 'Noetic spared no expense when it comes to great ambience, FX, and scoring.'- Indie Game Magazine 'See No Evil is a simple, pretty puzzle game for people who find beauty in strange things.' -indielove 'It is both pleasing and exciting to see gaming evolve as an art-form. To take a game and make it not only deliver a story, but also highlight key aspects of life and tackle some of humanity’s flaws without compromising in gameplay, takes a great deal of skill' -in2gpu",
