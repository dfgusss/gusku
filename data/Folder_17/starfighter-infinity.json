With a large variety of imagination - not just different numbers, weapons act differently have different effects. See the official website for a list Hunt down and mine precious minerals that can then be crafted into weapons/items Fight Realtime multiplayer PvP and PvE - keyboard or joypad based action involving skill. Action is skill based dogfighting style, with no fixed tactics: use a fast ship and evade, or a slower ship with tactical aids, and lots of shields. How you combine weapons and tactics is up to you. Designed so that pretty much any ship in game is a threat - you are not 'the chosen one', you have no special advantage over any other ship except your own cunning and skill... Neutral zones, warzones, free for all zones, duels and also jammers, interfering nebula dust all allow for different types of combat and tactics, or no combat at all... Encounter several other alien races in the game with their own ships and lootable weapons/items Explore 21 explorable star systems with between 100 and 289 sectors each, with lots of things to discover Loads of planets to find (100 so far) with their own back stories Ancient Relics drifting in space - not all are just dormant Explore inside space stations, chat to other players while turrets protect you from incoming enemies.
