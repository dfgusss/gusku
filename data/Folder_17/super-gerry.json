    "About the game": "Super Gerry - Game of Tones You must help Gerry to find the exit portal of the music wonderland. Don't lose the violin or you will not be able to return. Collect all the note bubbles. Don't fall into the rift. Avoid all music instruments which are awaken to life. Be aware of the Groupies ! GO GO GO !!! When free libertine Gerry B. won a mysterious parcel while an auction in a TV Show, his live changed forever. The package contained the long time lost 18th century magical violin from the magic wizard Amadeus (WAM). Holy catfish! Trying to use the magical force of the violin demands a lot of exercise but Gerry can hardly play the chromatic scale. The magic violin was not amused and opened a portal to pull Gerry into the magic world of music and tones. Now it's Gerry's task to find a way through this world and collect as much notes and tones as possible. With every fulfilled level Gerry's skills as a musican will rise so he can hopefully find the portal which brings him back to the real world. Heads up! In the magic world is nothing as it seems. Also Amadeus used the violin for a long time to get rid off his worst foeman. But here in wonderland they are all still alive and are hungry like the wolfs. They are on the hunt down. They are after Gerry now. ... and always remember, the sense of life is to become a legend ! Have fun! FEATURES: unlimited Lives unique enemies super bright Full HD graphics multi-language support via symbols includes original violin songs played by Gerry B. based on a true story ! Gerry likes to play the game every day, too. Feel free to send us your questions and suggestions. HAPPY HAPPY VIOLIN",
