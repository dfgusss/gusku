    "Name": "The Fire",
    "Release date": "Dec 10, 2020",
    "About the game": ". The Fire is a difficult 3D platformer in a world that grows around you. You play as a reincarnated stone and try to piece together where you came from. As you move through the levels it becomes increasingly difficult and managing you're momentum and balance will become a challenge. The Fire features a low-poly art style that creates a relaxing and serene environment to explore to contrast the difficulty of the game. As you progress, not only does the world grow bigger, but the soundtrack will rise and fall with the world itself.",
