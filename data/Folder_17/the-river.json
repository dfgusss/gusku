You are a soldier who just came back from war and while you where sleeping one night you had a flashback and murdered your family. Now, you are stuck in limbo and you must relive every thing and try to collect all of the memories you can find. The more memories you find the better chance you have to correct what you have done. If you do not find them all, then you simply can not live with yourself and end your own life. You must find them all to awaken from the dream.",
