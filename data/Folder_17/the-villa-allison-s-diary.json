    "About the game": "A villa, a daily routine and an apparently happy family. Here is where everything began. After 'The Hospital' and 'The Cathedral', 'The Villa' is the last chapter of the Allison's Diary horror trilogy, where you will relive, through flashbacks and immersive cinematic effects, the frightening night in which Allison killed her parents in 1956. With the help of your faithful flashlight and nothing more, prepare to face an infernal journey into the terrible truth. Terrifying jump scares and a super realistic environment make 'The Villa' one of the best virtual reality horror experiences. KR Games As a small independent team, we started in 2016 making games for Android, growing fast and working hard to achieve the best possible video gaming experience, combining our passion and the latest available technologies, winking to the future of digital entertainment.",
