    "About the game": "In Tori, players fly as a bird through a mystical land interacting with the spirits of sound to bring life to the floating islands of Otokai. As players soar through the islands of Otokai they are greeted by countless icons and themes stemming from Japanese culture. Through interacting with Kami, the musical spirits of the objects that cover the land, players bring about events and storylines based on tales of Shintoism. Tori aims to artistically portray these tales and to build players’ interest in seeking a deeper understanding of Japanese culture and values. Fly through environments inspired by Japanese culture and legend. Discover the story of each island by bringing life to them. Listen as the world's sounds respond to the way that you explore.",
