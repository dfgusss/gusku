To crack each level, you'll need to figure out the right sequence of interactions to bring each coloured piece together, changing the cell structure by breaking open walls or creating new divisions. You'll need to unlock resources then use catalysts to create the compounds you need. As you progress, new and unusual elements emerge and combine together inside shifting cell structures to challenge your lateral thinking. Features 100 unique puzzle levels. A huge variety of cell elements that interact in unique ways. Guided tutorial levels to introduce you to the gameplay and terminology. Non-linear progression based on your mastery of particular elements. Undo/Redo capabilities let you experiment with different approaches to each level.
