    "About the game": "You've been recommended to the head of the Detective Department because you have a really good memory. You have accepted to have a meeting with him to demonstrate your capabilities. But be careful, the boss has anger issues. You have 50 seconds to look around a certain room and keep in mind the maximum details you can. The detective will ask you questions about that room. Choose the correct answer. If you fail 3 times, it's Game Over. If you don't remember something, you can REWIND and go to the same room, being able to look around again for a few seconds. If you succeed answering all the questions in one room, you gain 1 extra rewind. You don't want to know what happens if you answer incorrectly 3 times... Rooms are different every time you play, so keep an eye on the details!",
