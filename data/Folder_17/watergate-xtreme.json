    "About the game": "You and up to three friends (or three computer controlled guys if you're short on friends) are in a top down maze trying to hit each other with your bombs, but you're going to have to control your guy and your bomb at the same time! It's hard. It's really hard and it's going to put your ambidexterity to the test. Choose from 8 characters, 8 levels, there's like 5 catchy 8-bit songs, I don't know, what are you waiting for? It's gonna be super fun and all your friends will think you're really cool when you drop Watergate trivia on them like how G Gordon Liddy ate a rat once. Anyway, call your friends, invite them over, pour some glasses of your favorite beverages, and play some Watergate Xtreme.",
