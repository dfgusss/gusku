    "About the game": "LIVE THE LIFE OF A WILD WOLF You are a young gray wolf. Born in the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park, you learned the ways of the wolf in your family pack. Now you are venturing out on your own — to explore, hunt, find a mate, establish territory, and raise your own family. EMBARK ON A QUEST FOR SURVIVAL Your quest begins on the slopes of Amethyst Mountain. Here you must test your hunting skills against elk, moose, and mule deer. Once you're a skilled hunter, you can seek out another wolf to become your mate. Then, together, you venture to Slough Creek, cutting through the the mountains north of the Lamar Valley, to establish a territory and den site and raise a litter of pups. You must feed them, play with them, protect them from deadly competitors, and take them on a cross-country journey to a summer home. Can your little family pack succeed? EXPERIENCE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK Explore WolfQuest's realistic recreation of the Northern Range of Yellowstone National Park — 'the Serengeti of North America' — where herds of elk and other ungulates roam the sagebrush steppe grasslands, alpine forests, and magnificent high ridges. But watch out for packs of stranger wolves, who patrol their territories and don't look kindly on intruders. The wilderness brims with other dangers as well — grizzly bears, cougars, and coyotes — who all vie with you for territory and food. REALISTIC ECOLOGY AND GAMEPLAY WolfQuest: Anniversary Edition raises the bar for realistic and accurate eco-simulation gameplay: Herds of elk roam the land in realistic herds, along with moose, mule deer, beavers, and other prey. Other wolf packs maintain and defend their territory against intruders -- like you. Grizzlies, cougars, coyotes, and other predators challenge you over your kills -- and protect theirs. Wolves communicate with each other using natural actions and vocalizations. Dynamic (family-friendly) courtship interactions allow you to choose a suitable mate. Adorable wolf pups who play with each other and with your wolf and mate. Vast wilderness maps (nearly 50 square kilometers) depict Yellowstone's Northern Range. Innovative Age Perks system models the arc of life (and death) of a wild wolf. In Ironwolf mode (optional), live life on the edge: your first death is your last. Dynamic day/night, weather, and seasons immerse you in the wilderness. Sixty achievements, plus collectible objects. MULTIPLAYER! Create a public game open to everyone or a private game for friends only. Co-op multiplayer in Slough Creek. Raise your pups together! Co-op mission: Claim and maintain territory against rival wolf packs. Our science advisors include some of the top wolf biologists in the world today, who help us keep WolfQuest accurate to real wolf biology and behavior. MORE FEATURES COMING DURING EARLY ACCESS! The WolfQuest Saga will continue the story of the pack! Leave your summering spot and follow the elk herds through the seasons, helping your pups learn how to hunt as they grow to adulthood. Then as the years roll by, raise a new litter of pups, with your yearlings helping before they disperse. (Learn more in the pinned post in Community Hub Discussions, 'THE WOLFQUEST SAGA: Where No WolfQuest Has Gone Before.') Start a new game on any map, and as the years go by, move your pack to other Yellowstone maps anytime during fall or winter. Bighorn sheep! STEAM DECK COMPATIBILITY WolfQuest is Verified on Steam Deck! NOTE ABOUT FAMILY SHARING Family Sharing is not available for WolfQuest. We apologize for that, but we had to disable it because some players have abused it.",
