    "About the game": "This game is a educational game. I have taken a long time to think about some great ideas and make them all come true. It is so simple and fascinating. If you want to learn ENGLISH words or CHINESE words while playing, this game is best for you! features: This game can help you learn either English words or Chinese words in a funny way. As we all know, reciting words is the basis of learning a new language. But it is a long and boring process to recite words. That is why this game come out to you! With this game, you can learn over 20000 English words or Chinese words. These words are the most commonly used in English and are totally enough to satisfy the most of ordinary people in their whole life. But if you just recite so many words directly with a book of words, you must get frustrated in the end! So I have thought of a great idea to solve this issue. That is, learning the words in a funny way such as playing a game. So I have just done it! As a indie game developer, I have the full control to design the gameplay which is suitable for learning words in a quick, easy and funny way. All kinds of the stuff of this game is completely made by myself including programming, art design, music design and so on. And there is no doubt that I would encounter many many problems in the game design which are also needed to solved by my own hands. Fortunately, with a long time's effort, I have finally designed out several featured game modes to help stimulate your brain for remembering the words imperceptibly. Just play this game, learn words and have fun! Thanks for playing my game!!!",
