    "About the game": "Worlds Adrift is a Community-Crafted MMO; look out to the horizon, and each and every island that scatters the skyline was crafted by a player, using our free Island Creator tool. We decided against a procedurally generated environment for one reason; we knew the community would craft a more engaging and dynamic world. And two years later - and over a 1000 islands in - it turns out we were right. Dense tropical jungles, deep cavernous craters, long abandoned megacomplexes… each and every island is beautifully distinct, meticulously designed, and a completely unique adventure in its own right. Every island has the chance to make it into the final game, where it will be experienced by thousands of future players. Originally created as an internal tool, the Island Creator allows you to use a diverse set of models and textures to create something completely unique; choose a terrain, select a style of architecture, build a network of buildings and passages. With over 1000 assets at your disposal, every island is a totally unique experience. A crumbling metropolis or an overgrown forest dwelling, create an entire narrative for others to uncover! Switch to play mode and explore your island from a player’s perspective. What works? What doesn’t? Tweak your adventure however you see fit. Browse Steam Workshop to discover an archive of islands already submitted by the community, ready for you to explore, trial and rate. Then, why not jump into Worlds Adrift, and experience the real thing. Adventure awaits... Explore. Build. Unite.",
