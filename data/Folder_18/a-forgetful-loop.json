With those fateful words, you join the team of Hope Labs. A group of scientists &amp; engineers, setting out to change the world. Except, it all goes wrong. And now the team needs to band together, to fix the machine, to get back to normal, to before it all broke... A Forgetful Loop is a time-based worker-placement puzzle game, where you need to weigh up which nodes are more important at a given moment; To get closer to the core, closer to the finish line! 'Jennifer, Isabel, whatever's happening with you, I'm sorry -' '- but we've only got seconds until we loop again.' 'If you remember this conversation... help us fix the machine!' The loop restarts again.",
