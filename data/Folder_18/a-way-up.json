Play as a meteorite to help it get back to space Venture vertiacally from magma caves through city up to high skies Simple, dynamic controls - hold a mouse button over a meteorite and throw it About 2 hours of gameplay depending (can take much longer) Intense, engaging sometimes frustrating, yet satisfying Try to get the best time",
