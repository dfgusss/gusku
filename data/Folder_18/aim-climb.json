    "About the game": "'AIM' × 'Climbing Game' Aim Climb' is a platform game in which you use your 'Aiming skill' to climb to the top and reach the summit. Aim accurately at the scattered 'targets' and click to make your character make a big jump. . However, if left unattended, the character will fall down. Thus, it means you need to click on the next target during the dwell time. . 'Continuous jumps feel great!!!!!' The character jumps toward the clicked location. In order to climb up efficiently, the horizontal speed must be kept as low as possible. In other words, you must instantly consider the target to aim at and the timing of that click, depending on the character's position and the direction it is going. ↓Bad example . What do you think? The operation is simple, but it looks quite deep, doesn't it? There are various types of 'targets' to keep players occupied. The higher you climb, the more difficult the 'targets' become. tracking and holding aim, flicking aim,, The thrill increases. If you happen to miss your aim, use the 'ascending skill'. When the skill is used, the character jumps slightly to buy time to adjust the aim. This skill can also be used effectively to increase the speed of ascent when you click on targets. It is up to the player's discretion whether you can use it well or not. ■Three levels of difficulty There is a difficulty level for beginners who are not accustomed to mouse operation, a difficulty level for gamers who are accustomed to mouse operation, and a difficulty level for so-called masochistic gamers. The highest difficulty level cannot be cleared with half-hearted determination. Cute dot pictures . ■The scenery changes as you move up. Caves, forests, old cities, waterfalls, etc. Clearing the game involves a great deal of hard work. However, let us guarantee an 'overwhelming sense of accomplishment' for that. . -Aim Climb- In a dark, dark cave, there is a cat girl who dreams of the outside world. Your Aiming skill could change her fate. Your dominant hand, holding the PC mouse, becomes a 'magic gun' that descends into her world to support her dreams. You need to click on the magic stones scattered around to climb. Clicking, climbing, clicking, climbing, clicking, climbing,,,,,,,, And if you fail to aim, she falls. No matter how many times she falls, she never gives up. Her eyes drawn 2×2 pixel are always lit with glimmer of hope. Do you really see that? Can you take her to the outside world? And when you reach the top, what will the view be like?",
