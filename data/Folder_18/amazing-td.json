    "About the game": "AMazing TD is a deep strategy game about building mazes and challenging each other in a competitive Tower Defense gameplay. Every map has distinct randomized tiles, which makes every maze you create unique. Reach higher wave and score more damage than anyone else in singleplayer . Leaderboard's maps reset weekly or daily. After the reset, new pseudo-random maps are generated and you are ranked based on your maze wave level, damage, and your skill level. Improve your strategy game and excel in your tower defense skills! Play against other players in real-time multiplayer battles. You and your opponent interact on a fair mirrored map, where you can affect your opponent's maze. You can even maze together in a mutual area. Design superior mazes and make more damage than your opponent to win the match! Learn the basics of the game in 19 campaign missions as you uncover new stars and constellations in the night sky. Compare your score on each mission against the best players. OVERVIEW Endless maps, games only end when you run out of lives Real-time online PvP multiplayer fights across the world Daily and Weekly global leaderboards with unique maps Comparative playback of other player's game Skill level progression Up to 16x game simulation speed Unique map properties, like checkpoints, teleports, money spots, bonus areas, slow fields, and so on. Detailed 3D graphics Unlimited variations of randomized maps, provide original gameplay every time Steady development with seasonal events! Unlike in most tower defense games, there is no ultimate strategy nor the best build order, nor the best place for your towers. Each map is a new challenge to test your skills. AMazing TD is made by the same team who were behind the popular tower defense named Entropy TD and Random TD from Starcraft 2. They are loosely based on Split TD from Warcraft 3.",
