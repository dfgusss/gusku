    "About the game": "50 students of the study program Media Informatics and Interactive Entertainment at the University of Applied Sciences Mittweida have developed their own game within 11 months - Ampguard. When light and darkness split the earth - everything chooses a side.While yokai and animals have always endured in the darkened forests, humans with their spirit birds remained in the safety of the towns. They intended to keep the balance between the scales of harmony. But time weakens the link between humans and spirit birds. A yearly festival of light shall strengthen their bonds. During the celebration, a defender of the light who shall carry the title of 'ampguard' is chosen. His mighty armour strengthens the bond between the wearer and his spirit bird. It becomes their burdon to shield the festivities from the advancing corruption of the dark. When the festival buzzes proudly, the troops of night come creeping from the forest's depths to drown the festival's radiance. Only the ampguard is the ray of hope within the last stand against the darkness. Ampguard is an action-packed rogue-like single player experience with an adaptable combat system and strategic gameplay elements. Fight with powerful abilities: Collect Shards, which you combine with Talismans to unlock new abilities and combat patterns, and defeat an eerie collection of creatures! Every misstep is punished, but victory is all the sweeter. Talismans strengthen you and your Shards. Gain an advantage by cleverly combining them. Discover your strategy: The unique combat system offers you a variety of combinations to assign to your shards. Personalize the moveset of your ampguard and win the battle! Improve yourself constantly: New dangers await you in every zone. Take on new challenges and benefit from their advantages. Combine and upgrade your shards at the workbench to be ready for the next battle. A dark and magical forest: venture into the mysterious forest and restore balance. Explore a world full of sinister Yokai monsters just waiting for your visit. Rest in the rest zones and gather new strength for battle. Reach the end and encounter the unpredictable.",
