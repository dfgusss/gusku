    "About the game": "Solve cryptic puzzles, embrace or evade vengeful specters, decide who to trust and unravel a mystery. Ancra is a narrative driven, puzzle-horror game. Explore the home of a dying photographer, and solve puzzles to access new areas. Encounter strange, conflicting beings and discover a haunting story, piece by piece. Try to understand why you are here, who you are and what role you play in their story. Features: Classic, survival horror style puzzles. Open level design, multiple routes and supported sequence breaking. Gaining knowledge and information is as important as items and progression. Obtuse objectives and consequences. Unreliable sources of information and conflicting interests of characters. An atmospheric, dynamic environment that alters itself as you progress. Multiple endings, with many small variations. Secret unlockables, such as a Randomiser Mode. A mystery that unravels in layers, and a true story hidden deep within the game. The photographer's house lies empty, its blood still. Before it stands a figure. The house beckons. Lights within flicker to life. Spirits stir at her return. An Ancra is only complete when it is understood. It requires both Vessel and victim. Whose remains shall you cast to flames? The book of the Serpent shall be your guide. And the final page remains unwritten. Additional Notes: Have a pen and paper on hand, take notes. Save often, perhaps with multiple files.",
