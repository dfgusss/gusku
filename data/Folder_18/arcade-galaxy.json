    "About the game": "Arcade Galaxy - a game made in 2D-hand-drawn graphics, which is a space arcade in a retro style. In it you have to shoot hundreds of different types of enemy ships, collect various bonuses, dodge bullets, and also make sure that your combat arsenal does not end. Do you like exciting arcade games, set a new record, and pain in your eyes? Then you should definitely try this game! But if you get tired of suffering alone, then you can play together on the same computer. Twice as many players! Twice the pain! Twice the fun !!! Choose a spaceship to your taste and go ahead to destroy hordes of invaders. On the way, you will improve your ship, and become stronger and stronger if you can pick up a good bonus, because the game also contains bonuses that worsen your ship (and your partner's ship, so don't screw up).",
