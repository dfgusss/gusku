    "About the game": "Description Black Home 2 is Warfare Studios' latest roleplaying game, similar to the original, and one of their most refined games, featuring an enthralling dark tale and a creepy, well detailed atmosphere. Mostly based on plot and exploration, the game plays as a typical 2D-RPG with a lot of twists and turns. Note: to toggle between screen modes, press ALT + ENTER. Storyline In the darkness, it calls to you. Silent, distant, like a half-remembered dream. It doesn't care who you are - thief, soldier, or nurse - it will claim you. It has claimed so many others. And you are next. Something foul has corrupted Grabstein Prison, and you are one of the few souls spared this madness. You must work together with two (or is it three?) other lost souls to survive the riots, the darkness, the foul things that twist the minds of the prisoners, and the very walls of the prison itself. Use whatever tools you find to navigate the blood-soaked prison, and uncover the mystery of who is behind the madness that now surrounds you...before you become a permanent resident.",
