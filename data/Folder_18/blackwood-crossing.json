    "About the game": "Blackwood Crossing is a story-driven first-person adventure game . A haunting tale of intrigue and mystery. You play as Scarlett, a teenager finding her way in the world. You wake up, disorientated, to find yourself and your younger brother, Finn, inexplicably travelling on a moving train. But when a mysterious figure appears, it’s clear that this is no ordinary train ride. It’s the beginning of a magical voyage, steeped in life, love and loss. Navigating this powerful drama - where the world, and your abilities develop in extraordinary ways - you are forced to examine your relationship with Finn. You are orphans, and your relationship has always been strong. However, adolescence has opened the door to new interests, and you’ve been growing apart. As you gradually uncover the depths of Finn’s anguish, the consequences of your remoteness become shockingly clear.",
