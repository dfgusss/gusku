    "About the game": "Box And Ball is a physics-based puzzle / construction game that takes a simple premise - get the ball in the box - and turns it on its head. Drag and drop planks, crates, springs, ramps and more to build a course for your ball to follow. Avoid hazards such as water, fire, wrecking balls, underwater mines, nails, glass, saws - you name it! Featuring a stunningly original soundtrack, awesome graphics and mind-bendingly challenging puzzles, getting the ball in the box is far less simple than it sounds!",
