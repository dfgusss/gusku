Bull was caught up in a rising tide of Norwegian romantic nationalism and acclaimed the idea of Norway as a sovereign state, separated from Sweden. He was a child prodigy, and he gave his public debut as a soloist at age nine. He is believed to have composed more than 70 works, but only about ten are known today. Ole Bull became incredibly famous and made a huge fortune. Ole was inspired by the beautiful Norwegian scenery and drawn towards the highest mountains. He was also an entrepreneur and tried to establish a colony in Pennsylvania, US, in 1852. Calluna was Ole Bull’s favorite flower.
