Mastering both positioning yourself correctly on the field and knowing when to invoke the power of each audience will be key to achieving victory in the Circuit Breaker Pro League. As you battle your way through the Circuits you'll gain powerful upgrades that will help you overcome the more powerful foes that you will meet on your journey through the different levels of the League.
