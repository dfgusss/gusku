Clay can be liquid or solid, and it can be deformed and destroyed. In the game, you step into the shoes of brave kids who bring the Claybook to life. Each chapter of the book challenges you with unique obstacles and puzzles. You possess clay blobs and morph them into different shapes to overcome tricky situations. Each shape has its strengths and weaknesses, and some even have special powers. Play through a wide range of challenging books and chapters. Invite friends to play (split-screen up to 4 players). Compete in the leaderboards. Achievements challenges you to use the clay blobs and environment creatively. Sandbox mode where you can mess around freely with all of the clay blobs. A unique clay simulation and visualization technology, designed for user-generated content and making it easy for players to unleash their creativity. An amazing in-game tool that lets you build books and chapters. No technical skills required and share directly inside the game with the Claybook community. Discover and play cross-platform (PC, Xbox One &amp; PS4) community creations directly inside the game.",
