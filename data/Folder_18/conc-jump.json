    "About the game": "Conc Jump is a game about FPS skills harking back to the old days of Quake 2 and Team Fortress Classic where movement and timing were key skills. If you ever enjoyed a TFC conc map then this game is for you! Pick from three core skills - Rocket Jumping, Bunny Hopping and Grenade Jumping. Challenge yourself to complete all 80 levels. The game is speed run friendly, with timings taken for all levels and summarised as a total time for each map. WARNING! This game is extremely difficult! You are not very likely to complete it!",
