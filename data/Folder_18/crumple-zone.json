    "About the game": "Old School Arcade Crash Racing! Inspired by the countless metal-bending games of the 90s and 2000s, Crumple Zone brings back the simple, colorful and timeless fun of ridiculous car-smashing. It's All About Destruction! You're a bad driver? Great! Crumple Zone is not about racing fast - score high by driving absolutely reckless. Car Customization! Beat highscores in the arcade mode to unlock new items to customize the look of your stock car. 2 Player Split Screen Mode! Remember back when this was a thing? Cheesy Story Mode! Single player championships are connected by a backstory. Get introduced to the lore, meet your lunatic opponents in visual-novel-like cutscenes and destroy them on the track. Real-time Damage Model! With a lot of crumpling - naturally. Fully 4k compatible and mastered! If you got the hardware, we got the pixels. Retro-Inspired Soundtrack! Carefully selected songs that bring back that 90s feeling - sorry, no dubstep here.",
