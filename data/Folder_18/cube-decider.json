You initiate all attacks and decide whom to attack first. The fight is turn based. After you attack an enemy, the enemy will attack in turn if it is still alive. You can “die” if your health becomes below zero; but you can make successful attack even having zero health points. If you die, you will have to start the level from the beginning. Also you can restart the current level any time. You task is to attack enemies in the right order to have enough health, damage, and armor to be able to make it through the level to the exit point.
