    "About the game": "In a small unnamed rural town, a girl has been missing for over 24 hours. She foolishlly ventured down a forbidden stairwell feared by every citizen. Now you have been called to find her and solve the mysteries of the abandoned mines. Is she even still alive at this point? Only one way to find out. -Venture underground in retro point-and-click style -Do battle with unholy creatures in real time combat -Solve puzzles and use inventory to progress into the labyrinth -Chilling atmosphere and classic pc-indie-game vibes -Unique blend of action and puzzle solving This was the first game I made in one week during 2009. Inspired by old horror games such as Last Half of Darkness and Uninvited. Created as a small passion project. Cursed 2 was finished in 2019, and now Cursed 3 is being developed in 2022.",
