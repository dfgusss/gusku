A draw can also occur if two teams have the same kill count or score by the time the gamemode ends.Team Deathmatch is called Team Battle, but the objective is still the same. Team Deathmatch is one of the most popular multiplayer modes and the least complex multiplayer mode. Conquest: Conquest is the 'main' gamemode , revolving around large-scale territory battles over map control points and continual attrition of the enemy team.Control Points, also called Flags, Firebases, or Bases, are the main objective objects of Conquest.
