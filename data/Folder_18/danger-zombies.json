    "About the game": "Danger Zombies is an open world action adventure game set on a post-apocalyptic island, a deadly virus that devastes the planet and contaminates 90% of the world's population. Experience this experience and get into the shoes of the incredible survivor Max, a skilled and destined man who does everything to survive and get out of the terrible deadly island that accumulates death everywhere to be able to find his family again. Highlights A magnificent setting: from forests and cloudplains and seas and rivers that surround the island, a beautiful island but should not be fooled because it is lethal. Brutal battles: With zombie hordes that don't stop until you see your end, you'll have to make the most of your skills and weapons if you want to survive, and don't forget not to let the zombies accumulate as your ammo will be scarce. An exciting story: action and adventure that will begin as soon as you tighten the play, navigate and control Max's despair to be able to guide you home safe and sound. Is surviving to be able to find your family something worth fighting for?
