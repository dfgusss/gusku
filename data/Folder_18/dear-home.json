    "About the game": "Dear Home is a game where you play as a tiny robot with the special mission to explore an unknown planet. This game offers you: Exploration: Travel with your robot through many of the scenarios: grass, mountains and snow; Mining: Shape the area around you by mining and collecting resources; Crafting: Use the resources you collected for your improvements and to build new stuff; Puzzles: Many puzzles to solve while you explore the land; Story: A simple story written by some optimistic developers ;) What story? Somewhere in the universe, at some unknown time, a small spaceship lands on a large planet. Inside, some robots are ready to explore this unknown world and fulfill a long-received mission: to seek intelligent life or to help one of the local species to evolve into a peaceful civilization. Which species would be best suited to receive alien help? And what will be the result of this interaction? To know the outcome of this incredible story (maybe not that incredible ...), just start this nice little adventure! Count me in! Please contact us if you have any problems, suggestions or feedback. We are very happy to launch Dear Home and we want you to have as much fun playing our game as we had fun creating it.",
