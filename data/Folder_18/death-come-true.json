A completely new science fiction mystery, in full-length live-action movie format, from genius creator of the 'Danganronpa' series, Kazutaka Kodaka.

In fact, he doesn’t remember anything at all. As he begins to look around, he suddenly finds a woman tied up and unconscious. The evening news on the TV shows the man himself, allegedly wanted as a serial killer. Then comes the sound of knocking on the door. ■■■Collect 'Death Medals'■■■ Each time the protagonist experiences a new 'death', you can collect 'Death Medals' based on the way he died.
