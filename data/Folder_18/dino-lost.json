    "About the game": "Our friend Bob gos lost from his parents, and now we have to help him find them. Our little dinosaur is both hunter and prey. You will have to act like a real dino if you want to survive. He will have to explore and meet other creatures in different environments, as well as providing them with food to help them survival. And there's no use in rushing to the end of the level. If he doesn't face a minimum amount of enemies and doesn't gather enough food, he won't proceed to the next level. We wanted to develop a game for the whole family. You will need to memorize the lay of the land to avoid getting lost, and also hone your skills to beat enemies.",
