    "About the game": "Endless Crusade Previously, we have developed the Age of Heroes, a multiplayer VR combating game. The original Age of Heroes has multiple classes: mage, warlock, archer, priest. Age of Heroes also has 3 raids: Hall of Death, Freezing Stronghold, and Fort of Horror. Each raid contains battles and bosses that require different team cooperation and raid strategies. However, the game is not as interesting as we had hoped due to limited raids，lack of replayability and pricing problems. Thus, we decide to remake the game based on the lessons we learned from Age of Heroes. Through early access, we hope to hear your advices and game experience. In Endless Crusade We try to • Add more maps and demons to the game. We expand the number of maps from 3 to 9 and the type of enemies from 11 to more than 50. • Rebuild mage and archer，introducing skill sets and combos. Each class now has as many as 17 skills, including active and passive skills. Skills now can form certain builds that fundamentally change your combat strategy and damage. • Add an endless challenge mode, where you may encounter a random combination of foes and maps. You can choose the rank you wish to attempt. The higher the rank, the more difficult of the game, and the better reward you can gain. Also, top 100 players’ rankings will be displayed in a ladder. • Improve character development. By collecting omni-stone, you can enhance your damage and defense, upgrade your skills and unlock more skill slots.",
