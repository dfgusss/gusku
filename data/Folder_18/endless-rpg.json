    "About the game": "Living World Generate a unique, living world! Towns grow as time passes. Buildings are destroyed and constructed. These changes directly impact what can be bought in the markets. Gameplay also changes between day or night, across the seasons, and with the weather. The game has a medieval, high fantasy setting. Tired of the world that you have but want the same party? Go on, generate a brand new world to explore with your favorite band of misfits! Characters Create a party of entirely customized characters! There are no restrictions. Want a warrior that plows through enemies with powerful attacks? Check. Want someone more cunning and evasive? You got it. Mages that can harness destructive powers? Or maybe focus on defense and healing? Maybe a druid for support? You’ve got it covered! It’s up to you to choose traditional character types or invent your own. If you choose well, even unusual characters can be VERY powerful. Choose from five races and customize each character’s appearance. The Rules The rules are simple and are based on: Small numbers (3 Attributes ranging from 0 to 5, Health 10 to 20 and so on) Rock-Paper-Scissors mind set (a tool, skill and strategy for each case) Less is more mentality (no text walls) Animated Combat",
