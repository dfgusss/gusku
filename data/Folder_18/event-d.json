    "About the game": "THE STORY The first manned mission to colonize planet Mars is finally launched into space. But before reaching the destination, the mission ends in disturbing circumstances: The crew of the ship has disappeared without leaving any trace. While the scientific community struggles to understand the inexplicable events, all other colonization missions are postponed indefinitely. The Space Agency, desperate to find out what happened, decides to send a new mission to investigate the strange events. The new crew, consisting of scientists, astronauts, and robots with the latest Artificial Intelligence, embarks on a journey into the unknown that will challenge their scientific beliefs and will reveal a previously unknown side of the Universe, forever changing the role of humanity in space. The Conquest of Space doesn’t seem so achievable anymore… ABOUT THE VISUAL NOVEL Event-D is a sci-fi Visual Novel, featuring a thought-provoking story about human exploration of space and questioning the role of humanity in this endeavor. It is a serious story, aimed at sci-fi fans and players who value story-rich experiences without having to spend hours and hours grinding. If you’ve ever been curious about Visual Novels, but you are turned off by the ecchi side of most VNs, you won’t find that in this game, so I invite you to give it a try ;) FEATURES: Kinetic Visual Novel (linear narrative with single ending). Story length: about 60.000 words. Play Time: 4 to 5 hours. Fast and straightforward storytelling, no pointless conversations. No ecchi, loli or waifu content. Thrilling and engaging musical ambient. Produced in 3D (rendered images), with a completely different look from all other visual novels. Unlike most visual novels, Event-D doesn’t use character sprites over backgrounds. Instead, thanks to the 3D workflow, every image throughout the story is a unique rendered image, with unique poses, rich environments, and camera angles. SWITCHING THE LANGUAGE To change the language of the game, go to your Steam Library, right click on the game and choose “Properties”. Go to Language Tab, and change the language from the drop-down list.",
