    "About the game": "Once upon a time, when only acres of empty lands, vast oceans and gods existed, the Supreme God realized this world was too boring, thus He decided to create all species – including Humans. Fearing that Humans could not survive in the harsh nature of the early days, the God of Courage - Gennaios – had stolen the sacred fire and bestowed upon man. Enraged with this action, the Supreme God decided to deprive Gennaios of all power and set a condition, which is if Gennaios can overcome all challenges, he can once again regain his old power and return to being a God. When participating in the game, the player will play Gennaios, and with the Sword of Darkness and Sword of Light given by an old friend, the player must conquer all challenges that are set.",
