    "About the game": "The 'Pixel Day' award winning title called 'Imperil' from Newgrounds is now up for PC release! 'Imperil' is a ruthless retro inspired platformer with puzzles. The hero must save the land that has been corrupted by evil. Place platforms or shift the world around you, move objects with telekinesis or burn enemies with fire to best the many obstacles you come across. 'Imperil Classic', the game we built for Newgrounds received much positive feedback. This is a more complete edition of the game following the same original concept and new features, more levels, more powers, more bosses and more weapons! Explore the world with little to no preparation.",
