    "About the game": "In next Life is a crafting, survival, and civilisation building game, where collaboration with other players gives you very real advantages (it is possible to play alone, but it will be harder to survive). Your technology level starts at stone age level, and then it's up to you and your village members to invent and craft tools and technologies such as fire, baskets, spears, ..., in order to survive easier and to advance to new development stages. Time moves quickly and each game played equals one life, including birth, childhood, adulthood and old age. The goal of each life is to contribute as much as possible to the survival and development of your village, children and future descendants. What you leave behind will be the foundation for others to keep building on. The flint spear you invented one life, could turn out to be the difference between survival and annihilation for your whole civilisation. There are hundreds of objects you can craft, collect, cook, and eat. We intend to add at least 1,000 more during the Early Access period. You start most lives as a baby, who has to have help from adults to survive the first few minutes. Then you age and become an adult yourself (and may have other players as children). If you are skillful, you may be able to live until old age before you die. If not, then you can just try again. This is a survival game where it is fine to die now and then (sometimes your tribe's survival may depend on your sacrifice...). You can always experience more 'In Next Life'! In the grand scheme of things, you are an immortal spirit who loves everything about mortal life and wants to learn and experience as much as possible. You start by living the early stages of human civilization, then as your skills and knowledge grows, new ages of civilization will open up. No matter what stage of civilization you find yourself, it will always be valuable to collaborate with other players. That's how you and the civilisation you are part of evolve most efficiently. The experiences you gain while living accumulate over all your lives, and will allow you to improve your crafting skills and become a more valuable tribe member.",
