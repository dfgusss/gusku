    "About the game": "“Bruce is a nice guy. Quite a regular dude, but a nice guy. He likes to go out at night with some friends, grab a beer, do a little partying. He’s also into skateboarding, playing video games, and eventually catching a movie at the theaters, especially super hero movies. Had a couple of girlfriends, but right now he’s not in a relationship, just dating a girl he met at a friend’s birthday. Actually, Bruce does not have a lot of free time, since he works as an assistant at Circle 9’s HR department. A job he is certainly not very found of…” It's a Long Way To the Top (If You Wanna Be a CEO) is a modern 2D platformer, a dystopian adventure set in a corporation, all done in pixel art and with a nostalgic 80s / 90s vibe. Through level repetition mechanics and skill building, you will face some very gnarly corporate enemies, chit-chat with some secretaries, and find out that not all is as it seems. Sounds pretty crazy? Well, you can bet that working at Circle 9 is not quite normal! * Rogue-lite adventure in a contemporary dystopian setting * Innovative game dynamics, with exclusive get-hit-to-earn mechanic * Wholesome, home-made pixel art visual",
