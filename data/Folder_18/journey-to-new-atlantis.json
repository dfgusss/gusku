    "About the game": "Journey to New Atlantis is a post-apocalyptic adventure game that follows Lana and her friend Marco in their quest to find water for Lana’s ill grandfather, in a world almost completely dried up. Lana’s grandfather tells them of an oasis city called New Atlantis, and the two children will need to brave sandstorms, roving bands of survivors, and traverse wonderful landscapes that show humankind’s effect on the environment. A point-and-click adventure set in a post-apocalyptic world, the game shows the effects of human industry on the planet and educates them that anyone can contribute to a different, better tomorrow. Journey to New Atlantis will lead the player through encounters like jumping off skyscrapers buried in the sand with a dune buggy, walk through a gigantic spaceship that has crashed through a mountain, and outrun men dressed in armadillo armor made from salvaged scrap metal. Each encounter will feature puzzles that focus on logic skills appropriate for the age range, as the game has received extensive consulting from a child and family development specialist.",
