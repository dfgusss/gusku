    "About the game": "“Deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before” - Edgar Allan Poe Gameplay Light Bearers is a multiplayer asymmetrical hide and seek game where during each round one player is chosen as the Shadow while the other players play as Light Bears trying to avoid being infected by the Shadow. Once infected Light Bears become Shadow Bears and start working for the Shadow trying to capture and infect Light Bears. If all Light Bears reach the Light Pool at the end of the round, they win; however if the Shadow (and his minions) manage to infect all Light Bears before time runs out, the Shadow wins. All Bears (Light or Shadow) play in first-person to create a more gripping and adrenaline pumping experience while most Shadows play in third- person to give them situational awareness and a sense of true power.
