    "About the game": "Cheat Your Way to Victory Light Rider is a high speed top down racer with a twist. Bypass opponents and obstacles using your spectrum drive, different color dimensions where the track is ever so slightly different and objects with colors at the other end of the spectrum become invisible and incorporeal. Shave seconds off your lap times with the clever use of the shifting ability to bypass long looping tracks or a time consuming switchback. Do this and you will fly right through the competition, literally. Powered by Autism Light Rider is made by adults on the autism spectrum at the nonPareil Institute. At nonPareil, autistic adults gain digital technology skills in various domains and work toward building games and items for the digital marketplace. While doing so, our members also acquire social and vocational skills preparing them for success in higher-education and employment settings.",
