    "About the game": "This game is a parody of horror games, rather than running and hiding from the monster you are now able to fight back! Collect money, buy weapons, repel the enemy! The goal is still the same, you need to find the documents and stay alive, but you'll have to look harder than before. Use the compass, do not stick to pathways, and try not to stare at him for too long.",
