    "About the game": "Mystica is a 2D MMORPG with minimal focus on a primary story. We wanted to provide an awesome MMO expirience but we wanted players to be able to explore the world at their own pace and to discover the games secrets and lore on their own. As the game is completed there will be large overarching quests built but they will be purely optional with nothing forced on the players. We want to encourage player interaction and socialization in order to build a solid community and world for both new and old players alike. The game is far from finished but it is very much still a work in progress with near constant additions. We started work on Mystica with the hope of giving fans of 2D mmorpgs a solid game to enjoy, where they can hang out, go on adventures, and maybe make some new friends. Some of our best memories as a child are from all the hours we put into games like Maplestory and Endless Online. We feel that a simpler game allows for a better community of players. As we build up the game we hope to build story through lore and narrative. Less 'get quests' and more of an open ended story that you can choose to take part in. Features Hundreds of items of collect Hours of game-play just exploring the world Familiar retro-style game-play Complex and interesting lore Awesome community of players",
