    "About the game": "OMG - One More Goal ! is an arcade / fighting game with soccer dynamics. The aim of the game is to score in the opponent's goal within the time limit, and the main concept is team play: to gain time and bonuses you have to pass the ball as much as possible to your teammates! We win together, we lose together! Story In a future dominated by robots, they fight to conquer the various territories. To do this, the small robots meet in teams and try to deactivate the energy sources by touching them with special mechanical spheres. On each territory there will be the 'guardians', an opposing team of robots who will try to defend their source (goal) at all costs! Gameplay To win a game and pass the level you must score in the opponent's goal, the ball must touch the opponent's source of energy. You can do this at any cost: fighting, shooting, tackling, and above all passing the ball to your teammates ( team play !). In fact, to score you have a limited time, and every time you pass the ball to your teammates you will gain time! The controls are very intuitive, you can only play with the mouse! The opposing goal is always upwards. Procedural levels! For now the levels are procedurally generated via Voxels. This will allow for always different, unpredictable and fun game dynamics! Even obstacles are randomly generated. Game statistics and multiple campaigns All game and level statistics will be stored, so that all players can compete with the online leaderboards! In addition, the game is structured in multiple campaigns, which will vary by type of scenario, obstacles, goals, goalkeepers, ammunition and balls to play with, for a very varied and fun game experience.",
