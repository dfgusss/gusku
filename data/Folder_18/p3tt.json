    "About the game": "Do you believe in time travel? Heavily inspired by Valve's Portal and Portal 2, P3TT is an indie puzzle solving game, featuring time manipulation abilities on top of the familiar blue and orange portals. Awakening trapped in a remote facility, you must find your way out, progressing through a series of levels as you go. In order to complete each level, you must locate the exit and carefully examine your environment to understand what series of actions must be performed in order to open the doors and go through. Will you manage to escape? This game contains: Single player first person puzzle solving. Physics and time manipulations by passing objects and laser beams through various wormholes. Cumulative challenge, starting up from what you may have already seen and acquiring new controls as you advance. Fundamentals resembling Valve's Portal games, and being well familiar with them prior to playing P3TT is most highly recommended. Disclaimer: P3TT is not associated with Valve in any way, nor is distributed for commercial purposes. It was independently developed in hopes that Valve would make an official release of Portal 3 based on the ideas displayed here. Music in trailer: Aurora by Frankumjay",
