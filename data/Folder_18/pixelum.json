    "About the game": "Pixelum is an innovative sandbox survival game made up entirely from interactive pixels, open to the players for exploration and all sorts of different interactions, combining fully destructible environment and survival/building elements. Features at the moment Based on a handcrafted C++ engine, Pixelum offers you unlimited possibilities such as vast world canvas and advanced physics. Here, pixels are not just about the graphics - every pixel in a special multilayered canvas has its own function and can be interacted in one way or another. Pushing forward the 2D survival sandbox genre, Pixelum brings you deeper immersion with game environment. Survive as long as you can in Survival mode. A procedurally generated 2D world Particle and rigid body physics Multilayered pixel canvas Fully destructible terrain 3 Biomes (forest, arctic, desert) Crafting and building Skills and Levels NPCs FMOD sound system with reverb, ray-tracing and spatial attenuation Dynamic environment with day-night cycles. This list will get longer over time, because I have got tons of different ideas on which we are working really hard at the moment. Questions &amp; Answers Q: Does this video show us how the game will look like in future? A: No, not really. I do realize there must be done significant progress and improvements upon the graphics, so I'm working on it heavily at the moment, implementing lot of ideas and making the gameplay and the graphics truly unique and fascinating right now. Q: But how intense is the development process now? A: Every day I work on a project and feel quite confident about the final results (see more at 'Why Early Access?')",
