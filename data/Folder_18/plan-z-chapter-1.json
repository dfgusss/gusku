    "About the game": "Plan Z is a true-to-life post-apocalyptic zombie survival game that includes an imminent nuclear meltdown, which shapes your every decision in the game to survive. Players will follow Gary Gannon from his home city of Green Bay, WI on his journey across a zombie-infested country to reach the west coast, where his father resides. As in a real-life situation with un-manned nuclear plants, Gary knows he only has so many days to reach his father with his young daughter in tow, which many post-apocalyptic zombie games never address. Along the way, he must make harrowing decisions to evade zombies, trust other survivors, and redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter, whom he neglected her entire life. As a player, you can see Gary’s viewpoint from a multitude of decisions and maybe learn some survival skills. Will you survive in this new world? What’s your plan? Game Features: Intricate story line: Plan Z’s story is rich with original and realistically in-depth zombie related elements. Zombie related pseudo sciences are intelligently explored instead of just going with the simple unexplained zombie outbreaks and implausible zombie behaviors. Plan Z’s story also focuses on non-zombie characters as well. Interesting character developments, plot twists, and character relationships will keep players glued to the game. Zombies will also evolve throughout the upcoming chapters. Interactivity: Plan Z is a choose your own adventure style game. Throughout the Plan Z game, players will have to make decisions that will directly affect the path of the game. Some choices will affect the game in minor aspects, while other choices will have dramatic effects on the game. Plan Z’s branching story line aims to add replay value to the game so players can get a much more enjoyable playing experience. Shooter: Plan Z has first person shooter elements. Unlike many choose your own adventure games, Plan Z offers players the ability battle zombies and zombie bosses. Puzzles: Plan Z offers mini puzzles that will challenge players and at the same time add to the story. This offers players a chance to explore and be a part of Plan Z’s environment and progress the story line. Zombie Easter Eggs: Being avid fans of the zombie genre, we added several popular zombie related Easter Eggs in this chapter and plan to do more in future chapters. See if you can recognize them all.",
