Key Features Hardcore that won't let you relax Modulators that change the properties of the game Unlock over 60 unique items that not only give you powers but visually change your character Explore massive, handcrafted open-world Fight through hordes of different enemies and bosses Switch between melee and ranged weapons Permadeath - get killed in REFUGE and you'll be starting again, but with new items and builds",
