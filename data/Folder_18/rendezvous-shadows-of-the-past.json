    "About the game": "Do you remember what they say when someone dies here? They “go home”. They reunite with their loved ones in their warm home, in the hereafter... Like Mom and Dad now. I miss them. I miss our warm home. But I don't want both of us to die to get there. At least this time, I want a warm family night. Not just a bunch of cold money in the morning. Can you do this, Brother? Just once? Rendezvous: Shadows of the Past is the prologue to the upcoming 2.5D Cyber-Noir pixel art action-puzzle adventure game by Pendopo Studios. This free adventure takes place in Bay City, following security guard Setyo starting another day of his mundane job — until a familiar face from his past resurfaces. A stunning combination of 2D hand-drawn pixel art in a 2.5D world, melded with modern effects such as dynamic lighting and bloom to bring depth and life to the city around you. Multiple paths lead to items, objects of interest, and tools that help you find your sister — and many secrets along the way! Gather clues and use everything you know to solve challenges that stand in your path to redemption. For the risk-averse, sneak around threats... or directly confront them with the (sometimes improvised) weapons available.",
