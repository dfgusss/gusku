With visuals that have largely evolved since the first 'SAMURAI WARRIORS', additional officers, and evolved actions, an even deeper drama set in the warring states is depicted. Also, with a focus on the lives of officers Nobunaga Oda and Mitsuhide Akechi, in order to more intensely and boldly depict the warring states era spanning from the end of the Ōnin War to the Incident at Honnōji, the title is the beginning of a new series, in which the stories and characters from the traditional 'SAMURAI WARRIORS' have been revamped.
