Pickup blinking Presents to acquire new Snowball-Launchers or activate an effect. Santa Protects the Christmas Tree is a simple and casual top-down shooter where You control Santa Claus to defeat stealing Snowmen. The game can be played with only one hand, because Santa aims and shoots automatically.

Power-Ups can contain snowball shooting weapons like Shotgun, Machine Gun, Sniper Gun, Flare and Bubble blower or effects like Sprint, Slow-Motion or slowing down the movement of Snowmen.

Stay around the Tree when the Snowmen are rushing in large groups and use close range weapons to hold them off. In calm moments use long range weapons and gather Power-Ups around the level to be able to hold off the next offensive. Manage the ammunition of Your weapons so You can always use the best weapon for every situation. Improvise based on the behavior of Snowmen and the gathered Power-Ups to beat the high-scores.
