    "About the game": "What is Smack Studio? Smack Studio is a sandbox fighting game with powerful built-in creation tools. Transform 2D sprites into 3D animations using our new animation technology, and bring your characters from concept to playable creation in a fraction of the time thanks to automation tools that speed up the process. Take your creations to the stage and battle with up to 8 players, or export your animations for use in your own projects! Battle mode - current features 8 player offline VS Take on friends or the CPU players with competitive, fast-paced gameplay, ultra-smooth game feel, and high combo potential Unleash devastating ultra attacks of your own creation (ultras for our default roster will be designed with balance in mind for competitive play) Play using any DirectInput or XInput controller (even GameCube controllers, via the MayFlash USB adapter or similar product) Character editor - current features Create pixel art animations with 3D depth and rotation, using a new approach that maps 2D images to bones in a 3D skeleton Take a character from concept to fully playable character in less than 30 mins, by using one of our templates (or characters created by the community! Yay, teamwork is awesome!) Animate frame-by-frame to add polish and customizations Create custom projectiles and special effects Add functionality using actions added directly to your animations- a form of simple but effective coding! Export your animations for use in any project you like- we hold no legal claim over any IP created in Smack Studio, and we'd love for artists to create, share, monetize, and do what they please with it! :) Additional features coming in the full game (not yet available) : 2-4 player online VS with rollback netcode (crucial for a lag-free online experience) Stage editor with voxel editing tools, custom textures, and beautiful lighting effects to transform your scene Steam Workshop support, which allows you to share your creations with the world, and choose from an endless supply of community creations Expanded 1 player features and new game modes- maybe even custom game modes made by you!",
