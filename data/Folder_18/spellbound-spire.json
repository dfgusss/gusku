    "About the game": "Location hidden, Al-Andalus, 1205: A wizard has accidentally created a powerful dark corruption that has spread through their tower rapidly. Your mission is to go on a dangerous immersive journey to restore the peace in the tower. On your journey, you will find a pair of magical gloves that can disable the gravity on an object, allowing you to bring the object to places that seem impossible. Spellbound Spire is an immersive VR journey where you, the player, explore a magical tower located in 12th century al-Andalus. The tower is filled with different types of locks and keys that are scattered across the environment. To unlock the mysteries of the tower and solve its challenges you will need to use your magical gloves . These gloves disable the gravity of objects, enabling you to make them fly anywhere you want. Allowing you to continue exploring the tower. However, this journey is not without danger. The corruption is spreading through the tower and will corrupt anything in its path. Contact with the corruption will disable your gloves' powers, and any object that it touches will immediately be destroyed. The non-euclidian portals allow for smooth seemingly-impossible movement from one location to another. By combining non-euclidian level design and room-scale movement we enable you to walk through the entire game in one continuous path while staying safely within the bounds of your playspace . This creates the feeling that you are exploring a large environment while avoiding the shortcomings of other VR movement solutions. However, this will not impede you from exploring intricate areas, impossible geometry, and the other mysteries found within the tower. Option 44 is a 3rd-year student team studying International Game Architecture &amp; Design Programme at the Breda University Of Applied Sciences. The project is created over the course of 28 weeks. We put our love and care into this project and would love for you to try it out. Feel free to tell us your thoughts on our game in our discord ! Additional Note: A play area of at least 2m x 2m (6 feet and 7 inches) is required. There’s an option to play within a smaller space of 1.5m x 1.5m, but this is not recommended as it makes for a less stable experience and could cause nausea, which some may experience as unpleasant.",
