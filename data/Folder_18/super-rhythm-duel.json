    "About the game": "Hello everyone! This game is my personal gameplay experiment, trying to combine rhythm + fighting gameplay to present an exciting fighting gameplay. The game is not finished, and there are still some bugs, but you can experience the gameplay! ----------INTRO---------- In Rhythm City, crime and chaos are disturbing. The balance between gangs is out of balance, the government is rotten, you must defeat the powerful enemies in Super Rhythm Duel, and restore the order of the city. Super Rhythm Duel is a rhythm-based action game. Follow the beat, master the rhythmic patterns and posture system to beat them all. Features: Fighting in retro 2D sprites Learn to input rhythmic patterns to perform versatile skills Each enemy has tricky combat style, and you need to counter their actions to beat them Try to equip different gears and upgrade skills to make combat easier --------MENU-------- Arrow keys: move arrows X: map options, confirmation Z: Cancel You can configure skills and equipment in the options, and you can also shop in the store! --------FIGHTING-------- Z: Place a blue note at the current location (combat) X: Place a red note at the current position (combat) M: Collect yellow notes to increase energy (combat) Use Z and M to play red and blue rhythm moves according to each section of the move table, and pay attention to collecting energy at the same time! Attack Skill: Inflict direct damage to the enemy Defense Skill: Resist the enemy's damage Special Skill: add buff or recovery There is a Posture Meter above the battle interface, and the two sides see each other. When one side is suppressed to the head, it will be dizzy and vulnerable. When both sides attack at the same time, the one with the heavier attack (not the more damage) will overwhelm the other's Posture. Defending the opponent's normal attacks will reduce the stance. However, if the dangerous attack is blocked, it will greatly reduce the opponent's posture. The enemy has several special attacks, all of which have corresponding countermeasures, some need to be defended, some need to be interrupted",
