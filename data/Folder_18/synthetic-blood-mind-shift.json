    "About the game": "Synthetic Blood: Mind Shift is a futuristic action-platformer with a deep storyline and fascinating binding of dialogues and deaths. Dynamic combat system, interesting characters, strong enemies and 10 different endings will not leave you cold. In the near future, mankind encountered desertification of fertile lands, which led to the emergence of enclave cities, enclosed by walls. In the course of these events, food shortages and starvation became inevitable. Your decisions and dexterity will change the future of humanity. - The gameplay allows you to choose your own playstyle, and the prime mechanics of the battle will not make you bored. - After losing a certain amount of lives, the character's brain will degrade so that you may not be able to use a line or action. - Dialogues and plot – depending on your decisions and skill – may not fully reveal the whole story on the first walkthrough of the game. Available hardcore mode will not be dull when you replay. Game modes: 1. Casual – with the ability to replay when the death limit is reached 2. Hardcore (Realistic) – If you die you’ll have to play from the very beginning",
