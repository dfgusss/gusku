    "About the game": "WELCOME TO THE BACKROOMS THE BACKROOMS: FOUND FOOTAGE is a relatively simple survival horror game with rogue-lite elements where you , the protagonist- find yourself trapped in a seemingly infinite maze of office spaces. Your single goal is to escape by finding provisions to survive and collecting notes that will lead you towards the exit- all while dealing with dangerous creatures called entities. 600 MILLION SQUARE MILES The known Backrooms consists of approximately 600 million square miles of randomly segmented office spaces, and is continuously lit by distracting, buzzing lights. Get the 'Traditional' backrooms experience as you traverse multiple levels and encounter entities like the Smiler , or try out Purist mode so you can properly immerse yourself in your surreal setting. DESCENT INTO MADNESS The very nature of the Backrooms eats away at the mental and physical strength of its inhabitants, requiring them to meditate, and rely on substances like Almond Water for sustenance. In the Backrooms you will have to scavenge to survive, using your knowledge of lore to make the right decisions. As you progress you will unlock new madness-induced hallucinations, new usable items, and permanent stat buffs, which will benefit you on subsequent playthroughs. YOU ARE NOT ALONE You are not the first person to be stuck in the Backrooms, nor the only thing inhabiting it. Throughout your escape you will gather information left by those who came before you. Unlock journal entries related to new entities, and build on your knowledge. Learn from their mistakes and remember- If you hear anything wandering nearby, it's definitely already heard you.",
