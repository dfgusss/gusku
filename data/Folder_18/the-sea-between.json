    "About the game": "The Sea Between is an indie fantasy JRPG, about a young man named Vis, who realizes there are a lot of things he doesn’t know about his family and himself. After growing up on a small island, Vis is forced to leave the comforts of his home to set out on an unexpected journey. Along the way he meets a group of new people and, together, they find out just how dangerous the world can be. Monsters start appearing in greater numbers, and it's up to Vis and his new allies to find out how to keep themselves safe and where this new threat is coming from. This game isn’t about heroes and villains. It’s about the grey area we all live in based on the choices we make. If Good and Evil are islands that we are travelling towards through every decision we make, then this game is about The Sea Between.",
