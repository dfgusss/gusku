    "About the game": "Introduction ThinkToDie Episode 2 is a level based puzzle platformer with over 95 levels where your goal is to die. You usually accomplish this by smashing yourself with blocks, jumping into spikes or getting shot. Although it might seem very easy at first, you`ll soon start to realize that as you progress and the more levels you pass, the harder it`ll become. A fun game shaping up the a suicidal puzzler genre. The game was designed to make you constantly think outside the box and find creative and new ways to kill yourself. As you progress you`ll experience harder and harder levels, new items and objects. About the game Think To Die -Episode 2 follows the steps of Think To Die Part 1. Episode 2 however focuses much more on Quality than on Quantity. Every level has its own level design, and every puzzle challenges the player anew. The music from Part 1 was taken over and a few new background music tracks have been added. The game is now fully in 3D and the graphics have been completely changed. The puzzles are way harder to solve and some controls (like the click-teleportation controls) haven been improved and changed. Controller The game is NOT meant to be played with a controller, however, it is possible to play most of the levels with it but is not supported.
