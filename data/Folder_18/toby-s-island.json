    "About the game": "Toby’s Island is a 2D RPG adventure involving monster-raising, town-building, and exploration with a blend of randomized and controlled story events. An evil, sealed deep in the island's core has regained influence on the surface and it is Toby's job to end The Dark One's tyranny once and for all. To do so you will explore an island with many unique environments, meet new spirit companions, inject those spirits into eggs to fight alongside you, gather resources for building and crafting - all while facing an assortment of beneficial or dangerous (both random and planned) challenges. The game: features a story mode and a free play mode - and a quit button. is directed towards 90's gamers - because I'm selfish contains a mix of light-hearted/funny and dark themes - night time is a dark theme, right? features many puzzles and mini-games. - most puzzles are in the retirement home biome is stuffed full of random events, rewards, character mysteries and easter eggs.&lt;-- If I could give you chocolate I would. features a creature growing system where you raise monsters from eggs and evolve them. - wow how innovative! features a multi evolution path where your fighting style can determine the direction your creature evolves. - I have no jokes for this one. features a farming system for growing food for survival, battle buffs or quests - Almost definitely not steroids. features a fully-animated classic side view turn-based battle system. - This is a favorite amongst call of duty fans. features a mix of original soundtrack and music from other talented artists. - the soundtrack needed to have talent, that's where the 'other artists' came in. I am open to suggestions to include things players want as the game is still in development! The Idea The idea is to take many of the different genres I enjoyed as a kid and make a tasty PC game sandwich out of them, which I think is most kids dream at one point or another, except for Ted...he wanted to be a fire truck...we don't talk to Ted. I want to try and get things right that I think those genres sometimes got wrong. Of course, I will get many things wrong too, but I want to shape and evolve this game for a long time to come. Here on Toby's Island we listen and respond to feedback...mostly because it's an island and we have nothing better to do.",
