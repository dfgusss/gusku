    "About the game": "VRG is an FPS that combines a modern shooter and a retro shooter. Wolfenstein II: Inspired by The new colossus and TitanFall. You can carry 6 types of weapons and gadgets and switch between them with the weapon key or the weapon wheel with slow motion. Includes modern operating mechanics for sprints, tactical sprints, wall runs, leans, and sliding (no ADS, reloads, double jumps), but the game progresses in an episode format like classic FPS, with no story. There are 5 levels and 1 secret level for each episode. ・Combos you earn, more classic controls become. A combo system that raises the rank by defeating enemies in a row is implemented. There are 7 ranks, and the higher the rank, the more the reticle contracts, the recoil decreases, the classic like movement speed , and it approaches the classic operation mode. However, the higher the rank, the greater the rate of decrease of the combo gauge and the more difficult it is to maintain the buff. The highest rank 'SSS' will be in slow motion and the gauge will decrease slowly. ・The means of recovery is a enemy Gib You can recover your health and combo gauge by eating the gib that scatter when you defeat the enemy. The more combo ranks you earn, the more gib you have, and the more you move forward, the more opportunities you have for recovery and combo maintenance. ・Weapon Ammo Shop You can buy weapons from vending machines with 'Meat mileage points' that you accumulate from the amount of meat pieces you eat. The price is set high at first, but the more you buy, the higher your membership rank in the store will be, so you can buy weapons and ammunition cheaply an eat. ・Dual wild that can be freely combined The easy-to-use dual wild system allows you to instantly switch between two-handed weapons (separate combinations are possible). Simply hold down the weapon key or select the weapon on the weapon wheel and click the mouse corresponding to your arm. ・Custom Engine with Raycasting rendering The custom engine used for VRG is GPU-based raycasting for all voxels, billboards, shadows, bumps and reflections, and all textures are 64x64 pixels with no translucency (not including the UI). All textures are 64x64 pixels with no translucency (not including the UI), a nod to the Wolfesntein3D era of FPS and an experiment to see how far raycasting can take us. ・Other Futures A practice area where you can try out all weapons and change the terrain. Horde mode, which can be played in about five minutes per game. Gameplay options. (perma-death, weapon loss on death, slow motion off) Retro CRT filter.",
