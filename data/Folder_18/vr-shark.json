You need to explore under the sea, fight with sharks, repel all kinds of sharks that attack you, and finally get the treasure of the shark kingdom. This game is fun for teenagers who love sharks. In the game, you will fight with sharks. Only after killing a specified number of sharks can you activate the portal and go to the next level. When you reach the last level, you need to defeat the guardian to get the final space-time map. If you have a time-space map, you can travel to any previous level through the map to experience it.",
