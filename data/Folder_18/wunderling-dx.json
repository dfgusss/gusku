Wunderling DX tells a touching tale of breaking free from the pack with a desire to change the world, even with the odds stacked against you. What starts as a retro game love song soon becomes an unexpected thrill-ride with twists, turns, and alternate endings. All wrapped up in a humorous script from the wild mind of Alex Faciane, accompanied by Ratvader's decade-bending soundtrack! 'Wait, what's new in Wunderling DX?' Thanks for asking!
