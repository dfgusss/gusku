Features a Visual Novel part and a Music Action game! In the outskirts of the Imperial City Tokyo, in a small town where the good habits of old still endure, the indie studio Eureka Soft has its discreet office. In the reunion room, the air is charged heavily with tension. The fate of Eureka Soft hangs on the discussions currently underway... nay, the fate of the whole world! Employees air their grievances without finding solutions. Anger flares, words are exchanged.
