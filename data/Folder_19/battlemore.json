A callback to both old and new strategy games alike, lovers of the genre will have a blast. Game Features: - 15 Mission Campaign - Army customization hub between missions - Over 30 unique units across 5 factions - Super Weapons to alter the tide of any battle - A Healthy helping of parody of the RTS genre. New Content - SwapOut!
