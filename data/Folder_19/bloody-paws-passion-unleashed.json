    "About the game": "Bloody Paws: Passion Unleashed is a remake and expansion of the 1990 game Bloody Paws, which was developed in Spain by Mar Entertainment and released for the ZX Spectrum and MSX. In 2020, a completed version of Bloody Paws was released for the Amstrad CPC. 'After a long day of work, you return home to find the front door open - forced! On the floor, there’s a shattered bottle... It’s the perfume that you had bought your beloved Samantha to celebrate your wedding anniversary. Someone had come in and taken your wife! A sweet and familiar aroma comes to you from the East. Now you can search for her... and you will! You won’t stop until you find her and whoever had dared to do this. And when you find him...' The original 1990 Bloody Paws was a game full of personality: a side-scrolling beat ‘em up in which players control a melodramatic werewolf on a quest to find his missing wife and fight a horde of eccentric creatures such as invisible men, rope-jumping mummies, off-brand superheroes, and the Frankenstein monster. The game also had an unfortunate behind-the-scenes story: the publisher released the game before it was completed, without even informing (or paying!) the developers. I got the blessing from the creator of Bloody Paws, Juan Carlos Sanchez, to bring this cool relic of the past to the PC and give it an overhaul. Free from the limitations of the 8-bit systems of the 80s, Bloody Paws: Passion Unleashed will inject the original game with color, gameplay polish, additional animations, extra levels, and more! Presently, the game features 7 playable stages, multiple enemy types, music, and story cutscenes. In essence, the original Bloody Paws game from 1990 by MAR Entertainment has been fully remade with updated colors, music, sound effects, fine-tuned hit detection, and additional moves for the main character. The final release will feature: Additional and expanded stages Boss fights Additional items and power ups to pick up (halfway there!) Additional music tracks (halfway there!) Spanish and German translation (almost 100% done!) Additional tweaks and adjustments as needed",
