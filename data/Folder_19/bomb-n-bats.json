    "About the game": "Local multi-player game (2 to 4 players). Only playable with joystick/gamepads. Welcome to the world of Bomb N' Bats. What is this game ? Well, to be simple, it's Bomberman meet Combat (Atari 2600) meet Unreal Tournament meet Pac-Man. No need to read a manual here : one stick to manage your bat and one button to launch a bomb. And to win a round, you must be the last bat alive. Let the rumble begin !!! --- Content of the Game: - 2 to 4 players can play in the Deathmatch mode. - All types of gamepads allowed (PS4, Xbox One, etc ...) - 30 different levels, with some which will modify seriously the way of playing. - Different bonus to boost your bat (or annoy the others). - A new game mode : Team DeathMatch. You can play different combinations : 2 versus 2, 2 versus 1 or even 3 versus 1 if you feel strong enough. - A Parameters menu where you can customize your experience. Good game, and of course you can leave your comments below (it would be very much appreciated to help me improve the game and eradicate the bugs).",
