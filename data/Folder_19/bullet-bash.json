    "About the game": "Blast through a series of FPS based minigames with your friends and prove your greatness! Whether you're an ultra experienced FPS expert or a more casual player, Bullet Bash has minigames for all types. From the sane and sensible to sheer comedic insanity, from classic minigames to the brand new, there will be plenty of fun (and agonizing pain) for all. Minimum of four players recommended but, can be played with as many as twelve. Here are just some of the minigames available: Rocket Jump Race- Prove you're the ultimate rocket jump master or the ultimate boomer who knows... Dodgeball- Similar to the sport but with more explosives, way more explosives... One Gun- Everyone starts with the same gun prove you're the best sniper/assault/shotgun etc... specialist there is One Shot Kill- Similar to One Gun but all weapons (and explosives) kill instantly. You've gotta stay on your toes and watch out because danger could come at anytime. Blindfold- Players receive a blindfold on spawn. Every so often the blindfold gets removed but only briefly. Knockout- Knock opponents out of the arena with some serious firepower. Breakfloor- Break the floor... and hope your opponent doesn't do the same... Trap Master- Reimagining of a famous game mode. In Trap Master you must either activate traps eliminating enemy players or survive said traps and return the favor. and more!",
