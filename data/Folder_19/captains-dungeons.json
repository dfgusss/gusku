What the King of Trem did not know is that Tazven was the sinister Sorcerer Leartnom's only son. The Sorcerer, of the opposing mountain kingdom village of Yekrut, hidden between the Serpent Sea and the dark pine trees of Adanac, vowed to take revenge on the King for his grave mistake of slaying his son—which could not be forgiven—even in battle. In vengeance, Sorcerer Leartnom cursed King Trem's only child—a raven-haired daughter, Princess Julia. The curse imprisoned her in the castle dungeon with a power so great that her lungs would be pierced with shards of metal should she dare step outside of her cell. Once the king came to visit his daughter and deceptively attempted to remove his daughter from the dungeon by means of a hidden spiral staircase that was only known to the servants. But soon he found that his daughter’s breath was sucked from her lips with such sharp pain that her screams echoed in the guard’s armored helmets. Condemned to the cavernous halls of the castle’s bowls, Princess Julia was never to see daylight again until the curse was broken. The King promised to give his throne to any man who could save his daughter from this dreadful fate of imprisonment just beneath his own feet in the castle dungeon on the Isle of Trem. Many soldiers and adventurers failed trying to save Princess Julia. Until one day, after a terrible storm in the Serpent Sea, the Pirate Magician Yapla found himself washed up on the island Kingdom of Trem. He was the sole survivor of his shipwreck. The Pirate Magician Yapla realized that the only way out off of the island was to open the massive castle drawbridge with the wizard wand which was hidden by Sorcerer Leartnom in Princess Julia’s cell. Further intrigued by the prospect of being king, the Pirate Yapla embarked on an adventure through the castle's dungeons to save himself and the cursed Princess Julia.",
