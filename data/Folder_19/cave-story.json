    "About the game": "Arguably the most well-known indie game of all time, Cave Story features a completely original storyline wrapped with personality, mystery and hours of fast-paced fun. Cave Story is an action-adventure game from the critically acclaimed independent designer, Daisuke Amaya--or Pixel to his fans. Overflowing with unmatched charm and character, Cave Story takes you into a rare world where a curious race of innocent rabbit-like creatures, called Mimigas, run free. You wake up in a dark cave with no memory of who you are, where you came from or why you're in such a place. Uncovering Mimiga Village you discover that the once-carefree Mimigas are in danger at the hands of a maniacal scientist. The Mimigas’ only hope rest squarely on the shoulders of a quiet, amnesiac boy who can't remember his own name. Run, jump, shoot, fly and explore your way through a massive action-adventure reminiscent of classic 8- and 16-bit games. Take control and learn the origins of this world’s power, stop the delusional villain and save the Mimiga! Key Features: Original (320x240) graphics and upgraded “HD” graphics Remastered music as well as the original soundtrack Mix-and-match new/old artwork and music! Six new play modes (including Wind Fortress, Boss Rush and more!) Over 20 epic boss battles through Mimiga Island 15 levels to explore in the vast world 10 unique weapons to find and upgrade USB controller compatibility Four unique endings Future content updates",
