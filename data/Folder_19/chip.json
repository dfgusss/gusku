Players must utilise their whimsical puzzle-solving prowess by tapping, moving, and rotating these objects to achieve victory. As the player progresses through the game they will find presents hidden amongst the many puzzles in Rust’s lair, containing a variety of Rust’s fancy dress costumes. These can be used to customise your little robot avatar, for bragging rights on the leaderboard and because everybody loves a new pair of fuzzy slippers!
