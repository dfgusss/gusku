He/She is the host and master who controls the arena with nuclear bombs, zone closures, gravity storms, and the power of their voice. This could be a real tool of self discovery; the start of your new career as a charming but deadly game show host. - DYNAMIC, TACTICAL GAMEPLAY WITH SURVIVAL ELEMENTS: Gather resources, craft tools, upgrade your gear, track your enemies, engage in both melee and ranged combat, and be the last inmate left alive.",
