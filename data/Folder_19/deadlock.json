    "About the game": "Take a deep breath. No hacker has ever penetrated your defenses, but this foe is on a level you've never seen before. Still your employers will not tolerate failure, so you must protect your network from this invasion at all costs. DEADLOCK is a virtual reality arcade shooter that pits you against waves of enemies who will stop at nothing to destroy you. Face down tactical troopers, flying drones and vicious attack dogs. It's kill or be killed, and to get the high score you'll need light feet, fast reflexes and a steady aim. Features Multiple Fire Modes Your pistols are capable of several attacks. Fire lasers or bullets. Keep cool and pace your shots, frantically discharge until you overheat, or charge up for massive damage! 3 Different Enemies Fight against troopers, attack dogs and flying drones. Shield Use your shield to protect yourself and reflect incoming fire! Keep it between yourself and the hounds if you wish to retain ownership of your jugular. Practice Mode One type of enemy get you every time? Practice against waves of whatever you want. Remember to Dodge! Enemy lasers travel slow, but not that slow! To get the high score you must dodge and weave. Watch out for the ceiling fan, it is the most dangerous enemy of all.",
