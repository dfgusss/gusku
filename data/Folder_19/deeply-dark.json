Explore the forest, use and combine objects to find a way to stop the curse. Equip yourself with artifacts and upgrade your equipment to face enemies in the Oneiric Plane. WARNING Deeply Dark isn't finished and it is in constant development. There are some things that we will improve during the early access such like the beginner tutorial and a combat improvement that will make the fights smoother. SURVIVE THE CURSE Shado accepted a big power and now he is cursed. His days are now numbered. You will have to work against the clock to stop the corruption that is constantly making you weaker and weaker and will even kill you. You should explore, look for objects and manage your resources to survive the most you can. THE POWER OF COLORS Learn to master the colors of life, contact the guardians Irial, illow, reth and looth to help you manipulate colors, use their weapons and abilities. GET READY TO FIGHT You must get artifacts that make you stronger and they will change your combat strategy. Upgrade your equipment and stats to face the invaders of the Oneiric Plane. DEATH IS NOT THE END The game is designed to be replayable. Whenever Shado is banished he can return from the Limbo of Souls stronger and acquiring permanent upgrades that will help you in the next game.",
