    "About the game": "my granddad came home from the war a changed man. he was bitter, quick to anger and aggressive. he'd grown to hate animals too. should a dog yap, he'd rush to kick it. how does one discuss such a person without being exploitative? perhaps we frame him as a product of external forces, a war perhaps, in effect making him blameless. I like to remember him with the aphorism, 'you can't kick every barking dog.' Pink Gator is a good name for a band I reckon. Stuck for a band name? Go on, call yourselves Pink Gator, I don't mind. Or Panda Punch. Something involving animals at least. Features: Full colour Interactive menu Bosses and enemies Sophisticated Mode7 &amp; effects Lots of noise Battery-backed memory saves the extraordinary progress of our young heroine Excellent fun for one player 'Get ready for the ride of your life'",
