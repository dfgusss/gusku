Players progress in the game by killing enemies to receive gold and experience and leveling up. Leveling up increases the players base stats while gold can be used to purchase equipment at random chests. Gear and spells purchased from chests have varying tiers based on rarity. Gear rolled in chests also have a slew of random attributes that have varying effects, each synergizing with a specific element or affliction the weapon and spells can apply to enemies. Find synergies between gear pieces to truly amplify your power to GODLY levels. Enemies in the game also increase in frequency and strength throughout the game. Both enemies and the players can scale forever, so make sure you stay more powerful or meet a gruesome end.",
