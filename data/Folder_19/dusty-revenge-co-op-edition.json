What others say about Dusty Revenge: Destructoid “All in all, it feels like a condensed 2D Devil May Cry 3, which is a great thing, and shows that PDDesignStudio really has a knack for designing technical action.” “All along the way, the art is stunning, breaking the boundaries of an indie studio and venturing into major release territory.” Jay is Games “The real juicy parts of the game take a little time to kick in (why isn’t the bear with the massive gun there from the beginning?!), but once they do you’ll realize this is much more than a simple sidescrolling punchfest.” Mash Those Buttons “It’s got a huge move set, simple attacks to learn, beautiful stages, great enemy and level design, and a fun, unique soundtrack. It does a lot of work to keep the game interesting and varied for its players, something very few brawlers manage to pull off effectively.”",
