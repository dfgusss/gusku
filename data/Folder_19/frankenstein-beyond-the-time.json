    "About the game": "After two hundred years, Doctor Frankenstein’s legacy will reach a whole new level! Now everyone can go on a discovery quest taking place in a Victorian mansion, where the task is to solve the greatest mystery of Dr. Frankenstein. The game makes innovative use of Virtual Reality with a well-known hidden object model and crafting simulations combined with the fight against time. Placing these mechanisms in a world inspired by the novels about Dr. Frankenstein provides a unique gameplay in a dynamic world full of adventures. The more we learn about the mad scientist's experiment, the more frightening and mysterious the story becomes. The game is completely immersive thanks to detailed surroundings. From a huge whale’s skeleton to a tiny vial - everything is highly refined to bring about the most realistic of experiences. What’s more, weather conditions affect lighting and reflections, resulting in a dynamic environment becoming more and more dramatic further into stages of gameplay. The scenario and main characters are only based on the novel by Mary Shelley and combined with our own original ideas. Rather than showing the theatrical version of Frankenstein’s story we have created our own, beyond the time, universe. Key Features epic Boss Fight interactive characters enriched plot with a philosophical journey special defensive weapon crazy time loop - fighting against time ca. 4 hours of gameplay thousands of highly-refined and interactive objects with sounds hundreds of square meters of scenes crafting simulations dynamic environment with changing weather conditions original soundtrack dozens of monologues explaining the plot and building suspense throughout a gameplay The Story What if I told you I could take you to a place like no other? No, not a world of fantasy or a faraway land. I can show you a place where the ethics and restraints of social rules do not apply. Where your mind and imagination can be infinite, where your deeds are not subject to judgment. It’s all about time. Time doesn’t care about anything. It’s indifferent to humanity. It passes aimlessly. Why? Because only we, humans, perceive it this way. But here… here it has a life of its own, it creates its unique world. A place where time is only a moving image of the surroundings. Home to the most powerful Artifact and the place where the Monster is born. Take part in the discovery quest of Dr. Frankenstein’s mansion, where all the items, furnishings and decorations remain intact after the his death. Your task is to solve Dr. Frankenstein's greatest mystery. In many places around the house you will find old notes and sketches, which, together, will show you the way to master the time. The more you learn about Dr. Frankenstein's experiment, the more frightening and mysterious the story becomes. The Artifact has created a time loop and it constantly affects the surroundings - everything you move, returns to its previous spot after the loop closes. The only way to break the loop is to finish the current stage before the Artifact activates again. Abandon all understanding of time as known to humanity. Go on an adventure in a place where nothing changes unless you make it. When you get there, your senses will suddenly stop. Dr. Frankenstein’s deranged thoughts will haunt your mind. The only thing that will matter is to finish his last masterpiece. People crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who actually do. Become the time master and carry on Dr. Frankenstein’s legacy!",
