    "About the game": "Three thousand years in the future, mankind has carved a bloody path towards domination of the known universe. Self-proclaimed as a divine race and beyond reproach as a species, they view all alien races as inferior. With fleets of organic starships genetically engineered for war, humanity sets out to conquer the last remaining independent galaxy - The Universal Heart. As Captain Iconah, you are commissioned to uncover the location and purpose of the Heart. Take command of a living fleet, altering your starship's DNA in real-time as you grant them new and powerful abilities. The Universal Crusade has just begun! Unique space real-time strategy gameplay that immerses you in an epic crusade with a rich back story. Non linear single player campaign comprised of over 30 branching missions. Scalable RTS gameplay : Resource gathering, technology upgrades and combat are scalable for even the most novice RTS players. Co-op mode allows two players to work together and control one fleet! Customize all 20+ gene based organic ships with over 50 different weapons and abilities, giving you thousands of possible combinations to choose from when constructing a fleet. Ship models morph in real time as genes are inserted, reflecting the choices that you make! Make alliances with the many other non-player character alien races to secure their support and technology--or purge their resources! Expand your genetic capabilities by invading enemy vessels, stealing unsuspecting technologies, and maximizing your gene bank's diversity. Gamespy Multiplayer featuring 12-player support and many multiplayer maps on which to flex your dominance!",
