    "About the game": "Ghost on the Shore is a story exploration game about emotional ties that transcend even death. You play as Riley, a young woman who finds herself stranded on a desolate island with a headstrong ghost, dead for as long as he can remember. As you explore the crumbling homes of the vanished islanders and discover their belongings, you get to know the ghost Josh. As you make irrevocable choices in dialogue you shape the bond with him, which ultimately influences the outcome of the game. As Riley puts it all together, she comes to understand how an island's history has led to Josh' death. Exploration and Environmental Storytelling You explore the beautiful scenery of The Rogue Islands on foot. As you do, you talk to Josh about the history of the islands, his memories, his feelings, but also about Riley’s dreams and goals, and why she’s running from her old life. As a team, you and Josh discover the old islanders’ belongings and uncover the stories behind them. Which creates a specific sense of what life was like on these islands before people started leaving. Immersive Dialogue A unique feature that allows the player to make choices in a subtle immersive way. You don't always know how your words will affect the other. Words are powerful tools. Just like in real life, things can become fun, exciting or plain awkward. Irrevocable Choices Every dialogue option is shown only once, which makes your choices definite. Branching Narrative The relationship you choose to build with the ghost defines the narrative branch you get to explore. There are four branches with a different ending for each. Features Discover the branching narrative and multiple endings Make emotional choices and experience the consequences Immerse yourself into a rich story and atmospheric setting Gather clues and investigate what happened Full Voice Over in English, Subtitles in English and German Spanish, French, Russian, Portuguese and Dutch subtitles coming soon Linux version coming soon",
