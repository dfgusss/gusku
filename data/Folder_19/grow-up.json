    "About the game": "While out exploring the galaxy with MOM, BUD’s parental spaceship, she goes to pieces. Like, literally – MOM’s all over the place. The positioning of that moon was terribly inconsiderate. Now her ship parts are scattered far and wide across an entire alien planet so rich in flora and fauna it would make even the most jaded galactic gardener’s head spin. It’s up to BUD to collect all her parts and get them back to the moon. Join this adorable wobbly robot on his fantastical acroBUDic adventure to the moon. Collect MOM’s ship parts with the help of your new friend POD. She likes planets. A lot. Explore an entire alien planet filled with excitement and wonder. And a Flungus. Walking’s overrated. Tuck BUD into Ball mode to boost, bounce and roll around the planet. Take to the air and soar between floating islands like a big metal bird with the Power Glider. Exercise those green fingers and overcome obstacles by spawning any plant you’ve found with the Floradex 3000. Ride giant Starplants into the sky (yes, we know what they look like…)",
