    "About the game": "GrowRilla is the first ever procedurally-generated eat-em-up, stealth / destruction hybrid. You play as a small gorilla, escaped from a military testing facility, who has gained the ability to grow by eating. Now you seek revenge on your tormentors by carefully gobbling up food and growing into an unstoppable monster to take them down. What starts as a fast paced, stealthy survival game quickly evolves into an intense battle as you grow into an oversized giant and wreak havoc. Tanks that were towering above you turn into portable hand cannons and waves of soldiers become all-you-can-eat buffets. Climb trees as a small ape to gather food. Later use the same trees to smack around your enemies. As a small ape you have to use your surroundings and the tools at your disposal to survive. Climb trees, buildings and mountains in order to escape detection and scout the area. Take out stray soldiers and use their guns to acquire more food. Steal grenades to sneakily assassinate the military leaders. The possibilities are endless. With every playthrough you will explore a new, freshly-generated island (assuming you manage to survive its many dangers). Unlock new game modes and tons of new content as you progress. Each run is a new experience. Run, hide and climb while you're small to outsmart your enemies. Punch, shoot and throw - Use the enemy’s own weapons against them! Full Freedom - Every object is a potential tool Intuitive locomotion system carefully designed to avoid motion sickness Get big , then go all out and get your revenge on the military. Randomized island with new surprises every time. Unlock new content with each playthrough. Regularly updated with new features, bug fixes and content. Feel the intense satisfaction of supporting indie developers trying to create unique VR experiences. Eat. Grow. Fight. === GrowRilla was in Early Access from 12.09.2019 until 09.07.2020.
