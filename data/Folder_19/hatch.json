    "About the game": "Hatch is a PS1 / N64 style first person climbing game. Unforgivingly challenging and heavily focused on atmosphere, it's meant to mimic the feeling you get when rock climbing - frustrating, but highly rewarding when you reach the top. There's more to it than the mechanics however; so be patient, careful, and enjoy the views on your way to the top! Estimated play time: 30 - 60 minutes (or more) CONTROLS: WASD to move Hold shift to walk Mouse to look Space to Jump Climb by walking or jumping on angled walls R to Respawn to the last checkpoint Esc to pause in-game",
