Key Features Unique colour-matching mechanic, offering a new twist on the classic adventure game. A heartfelt story that touches on themes of love, loss, existence and remorse. A world full of lively characters to talk to, each with their own personality and story. Stark silhouetted art style with bright, bold colours. Over 30 original music tracks, composed exclusively for Hue. Professionally voiced narration by Anna Acton and Matthew Wade, some of the UK’s best television talent.
