    "About the game": "IFO is part of the CosmOS 9 bundle, a set of 9 puzzle games discovered on a mysterious, alien video game console drifting through outer space. IFO appears to be a simulation of the main functionalities of an alien spaceship . In order to keep its usability intact, we decided to share it with the public without altering the game's language and presentation, allowing users to learn how to really control these spacecrafts. Inspect, experiment and tinker with the enigmatic spaceship's controls. Observe, hypothesize and figure out the rules and objectives of the different sections. Prove your understanding and finish the entrusted mission.",
