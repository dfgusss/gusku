    "About the game": "The official digital adaptation of one of the best board games in history – Istanbul. Istanbul is, without a doubt, one of the best board games to have ever been published.

We maintained the authentic board game feeling with the convenience you can expect from an electronic device. So what is the game about? Can you be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies? • 🕌 Run, collect, and trade goods across the bazaar • 👳 Take control over your assistants • 📦 Increase your wheelbarrow capacity • 🧿 Acquire special abilities to increase the advantage over your competitors • 💎 Buy rubies or trade goods for them In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and his four assistants through 16 locations in the bazaar. In each such location, you can carry out a specific action. The challenge, however, is that to take action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave the assistant behind to handle all the details while you focus on larger matters. If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do anything… What can you expect?
