    "About the game": "CAUTION) This is a very painful game. Jumping Over It With Kang KiYun is a game that helps frogs get home through obstacles. Due to the rainy season, the frog was transported very far from home. The only thing the player can decide in the game is how far the frog will jump? Where will the frog jump? Don't give up and make sure to send the frog home. * Rainy ground is very slippery. * Bugs are the food of frogs. The frog that ate the worm can jump once more. * Clouds are more elastic than they look. * If you can't find your destination, take a break and look around. * It has nothing to do with individual desire to achieve. Please send the poor frog home.",
