    "About the game": "One, two, all together. Read the room with the world in the online version of the popular KUUKIYOMI series! Over 10 million people have tested their room-reading finesse with KUUKIYOMI, and the latest title can now be played online with people around the world! Up to 7 players can consider the proposed questions together at the same time. After each session, watch everyone's replays and vote for your favorite play or the player who did best. Become the most considerate player by gaining the most votes! We know you will love considering it together with players from all over the world. You will receive three questions. Consider the situation and move the red object on the screen. If there is nothing to move, read the room and do as appropriate. There are plenty of interesting questions to ponder! For example, how can you be considerate swankily? Vaguely? Or even adamantly? And there's more! Vote for your favorite player or the one who answered the question best. The winner is decided based on points from the sum of votes received and bonuses from the 'Loner' (received no votes) or 'Mutual Affection' (voted for each other) titles. Don't worry if you don't win. Keep playing to get a higher rank and earn avatars or KY coins that can be used to purchase avatars. Each play session is like a short breather that makes you smile and forget a stressful day. 1. Up to 7 players are matched for each session. 2. Once matching is complete, the game starts. 3. You are given a question, and you will play a mini-game based on the question. 4. After the mini-game is over, you will watch the replays of all other players. 5. After watching, vote for the player who played the best according to the theme. 6. Play mini-game, watch replays, and vote. Do this three times. 7. The winner is the player with the most votes from all three rounds. Be flashy! Cool! Plain! Consider using different styles for different occasions! ■About the Controller This game is compatible with various controllers. For details on settings, etc., please refer to the following URL.",
