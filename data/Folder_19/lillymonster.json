    "About the game": "LillyMonster is a horror survival game where you must survive and bring Lilly outside. You play as the 'guardian', and you lead Lilly along. LillyMonster is a mix of genres. It blends the basic concept of escaping a horror maze, with strategic planning and resource management. This is achieved through 'Lilly'. Lilly is a cute, yet 'troubled' girl. As you progress through the level, she has certain demands. Sometimes, she is hungry. Sometimes, she wants to take a nap. Sometimes, she wants to sing. If you fail to plan ahead, pay attention to her cues, or simply lack the resources, she will cause chaos that attracts the rival towards you. If you are a good 'guardian', everything will be fine. Your job as a player, is to unlock the final door, while deciding how to manage Lilly. She’s a very unique character with many annoyances, making her come to life in a cute and playful fashion. So what are you waiting for? Lilly wants to play... Features: 1 gamemode whereby you manage Lilly and attempt to deliver all 7 eggs while avoiding the rival",
