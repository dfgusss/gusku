    "Release date": "Jul 7, 2017",
    "About the game": "OVERVIEW Little Red Lie is a narrative-focused, interactive fiction experience that reduces the traditional nine-verb adventure game structure down to a single, context-dependent interaction: LIE. Gameplay consists of navigating conversations and environments which will require you to lie to both others and yourself in order to secure your financial and personal future. If you enjoy realistic and dramatic stories in a contemporary setting which deal with weighty issues of family, society and politics, Little Red Lie will offer a unique perspective into the subtle (and not-so-subtle) deceptions that shape our daily lives. STORY THEME: ARE YOU MORE AFRAID OF POVERTY THAN DEATH? If you grew up in the 1980s and 1990s, you may have been shielded from the full weight of existence by a happy and prosperous middle-class family, as well as access to an education which seemed to imply that your own life would be similarly rich with possibility. How is that going? LIE: THE ONLY VERB THAT MATTERS. Explore the contrasting characters and stories of Sarah Stone and Arthur Fox through a wide variety of dishonest interactions. And literally nothing else. SETTING: SCARS RUN DEEP Realistically told, and in a realistic place: The streets and landmarks of Scarborough, Toronto's most notorious, misunderstood and fiercely proud suburb. TWO CHARACTERS, ONE FATE Living in a common time and place, Little Red Lie alternates you through the perspectives of two individuals who never meet, but who are deeply connected nevertheless. Explore the dynamics of their lives, relationships and decisions as both of them come face-to-face with the consequences of who they are and where they come from.",
