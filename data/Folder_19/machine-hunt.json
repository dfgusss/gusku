    "About the game": "WHAT IS MACHINE HUNT? Machine Hunt is a first person, fast paced, chaotic shooting game that is aiming to bring you the old school fun feeling. Game pits heavily armed players against machines that have only one goal, destroy humanity. SETTING The world of machines is dark, violent and grim. They will not stop until all humans are dead. THE PLOT When an advanced weaponry base goes dark, George Flow is sent in to check things out. When boarded the transport carrier, the mention of advanced weaponry development, brought back flashbacks. Flow remembered the day many years prior, when he was at school. He remembered sitting in the office and staring outside the window for his parents to arrive. He remembered waiting and watching and no one ever showing up. Likely one of the most devastating sights was that of a police car driving up to the school. Its pace was slow. All George remembered was pain. His parents were dead. Gone forever. It felt surreal at the time. His father had been presenting newest and most versatile combat robot to date. The real achievement of Artificial Intelligence. The machines had rebelled during the demonstration. They'd killed everyone. The carrier finally landed. Everything seemed quiet and calm. One thing in particular. No people. FEATURES - 1104 Achievements - CAMPAIGN MODE - SANDBOX MODE MACHINE HUNT is still in development, there are a lot of things we plan to add to enhance a game and give you maximum pleasure and fun.",
