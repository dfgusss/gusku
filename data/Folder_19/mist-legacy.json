    "Name": "Mist Legacy",
    "Release date": "Oct 5, 2021",
    "About the game": "Experience the world of Myriaden via a top-down view that brings every character and dungeon to life with unique storybook qualities. Forget about jumping, climbing, and so on. This is a pure RPG, where every action you make is based on the skills you have (or don’t). No classes means no limitations. Your character evolves and grows based on the skills you use. No fixed blueprints are required for crafting objects of any kind. Mist Legacy is using a unique skill-distribution system that takes properties of each crafting material and converts them to items with skills. A world where skills matter. Forests, mountains, rivers, and even cities have skill requirements you must meet in order to explore them. This system even extends to plants, trees, and weather, creating a world that feels alive but also bound by your expertise. Your Domain is your home base for crafting, storing materials, and hosting guests. Like the rest of the game, your skills dictate the strength of every building in your Domain. You come from a world shrouded in Mist, a barrier that has prevented your people from exploring beyond its boundaries. You were trained as a Mistalker, whose job was to explore the Mist and keep your home city of Valsonge safe. But...something has gone wrong. You begin your adventure by awaking outside of the Mist, suddenly thrust into the “real” world. This was not supposed to happen and the answers you seek will take the heart of an adventurer to discover. Combat offers a turn-based and multiplayer combat system. As a Mistwalker, you can bring companions from the 'real' world that you will recruit during your adventures. For the most challenging fights, you can group with other players to form a powerful combat team. The game offers five combat specializations that can be mixed in thousands of ways to create your unique fighting style. Adapt your combat strategy based on your opponents and cooperate with other players to dominate some of the fiercest creatures of the game.",
