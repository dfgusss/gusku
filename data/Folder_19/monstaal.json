    "About the game": "In this game you play as a Monstaal, a creature transformed from another realm, that strives to destroy bosses and collect spheres to return to your home world. The game includes two modes: Story and Horde. The story mode depicts you trying to escape the world you've been sent to by cleansing it of enemies to open the doorway. Conversely the horde mode is a fast paced mob killing mode where you cannot allow enemies to overrun the zones. The three playable characters are: Darkat, Stabight and Sleaf. Darkat is a dark creature that relies on pushing enemies away with a roar and piercing them with a long range shadow ball. Stabight is a close range attacker with displacement utility to bring enemies into range or push them away. Sleaf is the late-game damage dealer who might be larger and slower than the others but fires multiple grass-based projectiles at enemies for massive damage. There are 8 standard enemies and 4 bosses to demolish throughout each mode. The enemies vary in speed and damage with different traits like chasing, dashing, exploding and launching projectiles with different attributes. Some projectiles affect your movement speed so the enemy can get into attack range while others will explode on environmental collision. The controls are rather simple: arrow keys to move, Z to use your skill, X to use your ability, SPACE BAR to dash and SHIFT to lock your position for aiming. The game supports multiple resolutions but is optimized for 1920x1080. The music in the game was crafted by upcoming YouTube artists and leaves you feeling immersed and engaged in the game. Try setting your fastest story mode time and lasting as long as possible in the horde to unlock Steam achievements!",
