    "About the game": "Curse humans with Poltergeist! [/] This game is a two-player battle game in which humans and ghosts are divided into battles. The ghost side fulfills the conditions presented at the beginning of the game, and aims to move things in the house and curse humans. However, if you move only the desired things, the contents will be revealed to humans. Let's camouflage well so that you do not find out what is the purpose of the curse ritual. On the human side, the goal is to carefully observe what the ghost is moving so that the curse ritual is not achieved. 【Note】 * This game is for two players only. Please note that there is no single-person mode [/]. * The operation is basically a mouse + keyboard operation, but only Windows supports operation with the XBOX 360 controller.",
