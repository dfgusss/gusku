    "About the game": "Nano Nebula is a relaxing game about discovering new creatures and environments while you travel between procedurally generated tiny-planets. You play as an astronaut in a deep-space mission, sent to colonize the galaxy. But upon waking from cryosleep, you find your crew is missing and humanity has almost vanished. Find out what happened - and save your crew - as you explore an endless galaxy. If you're looking to discover new creatures, explore unique environments, solve ancient puzzles, or battle formidable foes, this is the game for you! Explore. Procedurally generated planets to explore in VR. Every world is unique, but not random or messy. Adventure in grassy fields, scorching deserts, boreal forests, vast oceans, poisonous swamps, frozen wilderness, and dangerous volcanic planets. Battle. Engage in combat against a wide variety of alien life. Giant space-squids, sand worms, elemental dragons, ancient weaponry, golems, slimes, ancient sages, phantoms and more await you. Discover. Record your discoveries using the 'Discovery Camera.' Take pictures of every new creature, item, and location you find to log it in your Discovery Log. Upgrade. Upgrade your ship and your gear. Find specialized space-suits to increase your resistance to certain elements. Build technology like teleporters and fuel-extractors to improve your mobility. Zero-Gravity. Zero-gravity gameplay. Propel yourself through the vacuum of space in order to loot old spaceships, mine resources on asteroids, and attack alien nests in zero-gravity. Locomotion. Free (touchpad/joystick) locomotion, with a variety of comfort options. Teleportation is not available, but comfort options are very helpful if you are prone to motion sickness. Comfort options include a floor grid, a spherical grid around the playspace, and a marker for the room center. Each can be configured to appear constantly, or dynamically based on the movement circumstance. Save Files. Up to four save files. If you share a VR headset with family or friends, they can play on their own save file. Music. A large and high-quality soundtrack by Antti Luode. Enjoy over 45 tracks as you explore and battle.",
