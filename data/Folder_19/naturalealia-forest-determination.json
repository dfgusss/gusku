    "About the game": "Based on 1930's cartoon style made with hand-drawn animations, the game tells the story of 6 animals over the course of 12 levels while they interact with the effects of humans over the environment. You can't fight back, all you can do is try to survive. Play as 3 different animals (male or female) with their unique gameplay where you try to avoid being hit, without being able to fight back. Run and jump avoiding obstacles as a deer or a sheep, fly up and down as 2 birds avoiding polluted clouds and swim around as 2 fish avoiding being fished or stuck in bags. All of that to try to escape the Forest Determination and find a new safe place to live. Each one of the 12 levels has 3 patterns of attacks. **Warning*** If the game's resolution seems off, try to disable Window's font scaling or set it to default (100%)",
