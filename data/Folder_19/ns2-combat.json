    "About the game": "NS2: Combat includes seven different player-controllable lifeforms, a vault full of weapons and abilities, a stats system, full modding support and five original maps. Games last around 15 minutes and players may join and leave at any time without disrupting gameplay. Faultline Games is a game developer that started as a mod team. Our indie-publisher, Unknown Worlds , also started as a mod team. NS2: Combat evolved from the modding community of Natural Selection 2 to become a standalone game. It does not require Natural Selection 2 in order to play.",
