    "About the game": "We have made mistakes in our lives. But now we have been given a second chance. A recruiter from “Redemption” came to me right after the trial and offered me a simple choice — either I go to jail or exorcise the Dark Forces around the world. I chose the second option... I didn't know then what dangers I would face. Terrible monsters come from cursed places. But that's not all. Dangerous cultists rush there in an attempt to gain strength and make Satan come faster. And they don't give us a damn weapon. And how are we supposed to beat them? GAMEPLAY Visit cursed places around the world with your friends. Each place is a unique quest with several endings. Destroy the cultists and avoid monsters. You will have puzzles, hide-and-seek, and various outfits.",
