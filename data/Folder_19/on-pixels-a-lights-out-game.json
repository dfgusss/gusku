    "About the game": "In the On Pixels game the goal is to leave all the lights on at the same time, using the minimum amount of movements for this. The levels were carefully done one by one and balanced with a good progression of difficulty. There are 5 game modes, with 6 boards each mode, and 10 parts on each board. Resulting in 5 x 6 x 10 = 300 levels for you to challenge your reasoning. Can you turn on all the lights using the fewest movements possible? FEATURES The game features art made in pixel art, using the PICO-8 color palette. The songs are relaxing and provide a pleasant experience for the player.
