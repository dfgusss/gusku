    "About the game": "The game takes place in a surreal world of imagination, which gives the player the opportunity to experience the extraordinary properties of the game space, to see a new reality in which no one has ever been. The player will meet amazing characters that the author imagined, and it was there that the universe 'Once in my Head' was born. The reality invented by the author absorbs the player and creates a sense of power and invincibility. The player is on the verge of losing and continuing the game. GAME FEATURES PLAY AS A 'CIVILIAN' OF ONE OF THE VILLAGES We are playing for one of the author's projections, in which all the residual intelligence and strength are concentrated. The author worked day and night, his thoughts became more voluminous and heavier, winning over his exhausted consciousness due to hard work. So the bad entity was able to materialize directly from his thoughts into the universe. * Using an arsenal of upgraded weapons, find out what's going on in the world * Improve your stats to fight back against the most dangerous creatures in the game world * Make decisions depending on the style of play. Whether you are kind or evil, or generally neutral, the world will remember your decision. EXPLORE A SOULLESS AND LARGE-SCALE WORLD FILLED WITH DANGERS * Explore caves, ruins and other locations. Trade with merchants in villages, towns and on the roads. * The game world is concentrated on an island under the constant supervision of the thief of the author's consciousness, who, having reigned over the world, plots and tries to kill our hero for the fact that in the book the author wanted to neglect the bad and black. * A lot of plot forks in the main and additional scenarios will allow you to go through the game always in different ways. * Use your ability to switch between ordinary and surreal worlds to see what is hidden.",
