All in all, the United States conducted 43 nuclear tests on or near the atoll after the WW2. Local people are still dealing with the aftermath. In this VR experience you will feel the effects of “Ivy Mike” 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) from ground zero. Afterwards you will get a detailed look at the structure and effects of a thermonuclear explosion. You can walk on top of a radioactive waste repository, and meet the people who live in the former nuclear testing area.
