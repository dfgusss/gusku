Stay above the Surf! guide Phlam from log to log, try your best to hit the same colour each time to speed up your score multiplier, the higher you get your multiplier; the faster your score will increase but beware the longer you're alive, the wilder the surf is going to get! ★ EXHILARATING ACTION! Dodge Bombs and gather treasure, the longer you're on the surf, the harder it gets and you will need to try your best at avoiding bombs, eating 'Phlais' and grabbing bountiful treasure. ★ PHROGTASTIC COSTUMES! Unlock new costumes by grabbing passing treasure chests, become a stealthful Neenja or a bountiful pirate looking for lost treasure. There will be more costumes coming! ★ STUNNING GRAPHICS! fantastic unique art from a very talented artist ★ EVOLVING OVER TIME! There is lots planned for Phat Phrog; new gamemodes, evolving artwork, multiplayer &amp; more costumes! -------------------------- PHAT PHROG REVIEWS 'Sometimes the best kinds of games are the ones that keep it simple and focus on delivering a fun experience' – supergamedroid.com “Addictive, frustrating and hard to put down”- Alpha Tester -------------------------- Programming &amp; Development: Lee Art &amp; Graphics: Pakhin Music: Incompetech (Kevin MacLeod) Like us on Facebook: Follow Development:",
