    "About the game": "* What is PHOTON CUBE? PHOTON CUBE is a unique puzzle game which utilizes the properties of light. Control the Rookie Cube Trailer 'Ray', interact with bands of light and various blocks to connect your way to the exit! All that is needed to clear the 50+ stages, is a little bit of [knowledge about light] and your [endless imagination]. In contrast to the game's cute appearance, we have for you an Action Puzzle Game with a hearty serving of challenge! Welcome to the intelligent and magnificent world of PHOTON CUBE! * Game Rules Control Ray and solve the light puzzles. To clear a stage, hit all the Light Condensers on a stage with the correct colored photons, using the Red, Green and Blue Injection Machines! If photons hit Ray directly, you'll lose the stage, so positioning is very important! * Combining Light There are 7 colors of photons in the game. RED (R), GREEN (G), BLUE (B), CYAN (C), MAGENTA (M), YELLOW (Y) and WHITE (W). Following the laws of light, the primary color released from Injector Machines will combine. As the colors mix, the light energy will increase and the color will grow brighter. When all 3 colors; Red, Green and Blue are combined they become WHITE! * Cube Types There are many different types of cubes throughout the various stages. From mirror cubes which reflect light, to cubes which mix it and split it, or even cubes which cannot be lifted... Utilize the properties of each stage's cubes and pave a path of light to victory! * How to proceed through the Planets By clearing at least 3 missions on a planet, you can take a License Skill Test to proceed to the next planet. - However, depending on the planet, you may need to clear all missions. By clearing the License Skill Test, you will become capable for proceeding to the next planet. Upon clearing the final planet, you step up to the challenge of the 'Master Trailer Mission'! By all means, check out this ultra hard light puzzle! * Controls",
