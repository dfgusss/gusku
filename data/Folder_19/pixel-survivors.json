    "About the game": "Pixel Survivors is a real time strategy - management game. Create some land and help your initial villagers to survive during the first period of time. Build houses for hosting your citizens, create chicken pens and farms to feed them. Elevate forges and tailors to keep the population well dressed and with the necessary tools for working. Contruct mines and foresting towers to get new resources once the surface has been wiped. Improve the efficiency of your work by adding windmills and sawmills. Once you've got a stable village, all you can do is expand your village and try to get a bigger population stable. Have fun, and see how far you can get your village to grow!
