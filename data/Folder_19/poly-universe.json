    "About the game": "A tiny band of settlers land on a remote planet. With you as their leader they will either build a new civilization, or be consumed by the foul creatures which inhabit the furthest reaches of space. In Poly Universe worlds are tiny but numerous. Be strategic in laying out your cities to maximize the limited space available on each world. Balance industry and residential buildings to keep your citizens happy. But don't neglect the defenses necessary to keep them safe! Here in the outer edge of the known universe, danger can arrive at any moment, and when it does it arrives in full force. Establishing trade routes between worlds will allow your planets to specialize and share resources, pushing the boundaries of your civilization even further outwards. But always keep an eye on the health, happiness, and education of your citizens -- with nowhere to receive reinforcements from, your citizens are ultimately your most valuable resource.",
