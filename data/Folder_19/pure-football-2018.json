    "About the game": "Pure Football 2018 is a fully featured American Football Simulator that draws inspiration from the classic football games of the 2000's. Get back to Pure Football Get away from the animation based modern football games where linebackers have 10 foot verticals and corners have eyes in the back of their head and get back to real football. Get back to a Franchise mode with personality In Pure Football, General Managers and Coaches have personalities and tendencies. Different coaches run different schemes which need different players. General Managers trying to fill those needs have different philosophies on how to do so. Are they aggressive in free agency? Do they reach in the draft? Are they willing to trade away their future for a chance to win the championship now? Watch as your league evolves as Coaches and General Managers get hired and fired around the league. Get Back to Football Roots Pure Football 2018 is set in the age of leather helmets and classic uniforms. Dive into the 1930's styled office with music from another time. Enjoy the classic feel with modern game play. Customize your way of playing Play your seasons with the including teams or use the custom roster editor to make your own leagues, teams, players, and coaches.
