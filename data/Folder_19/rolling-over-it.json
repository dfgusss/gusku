    "About the game": "Do you have the skills to beat this challenging game? Help a cute armadillo get to the top of the mountain, be careful with every step or you can find yourself rolling back to the bottom of it! Only a few players have achieved it so far, will you be the next one? Rolling Over It is a simulation game in which you take control of an armadillo shaped as a sphere. The gameplay consists on using the mouse's point and click to calculate your next move's trajectory, helping the armadillo climb platforms and slopes. This game is about precision, too much or too little force applied when launching the armadillo may end up with it rolling down to the bottom!",
