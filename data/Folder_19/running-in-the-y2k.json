    "About the game": "This game is an endless runner where every run is played in a procedural level. You will jump and shoot spears to hunt mutated animals. These animals will drop food that, apart from giving you some extra points, will allow you to upgrade different aspects of your character making each run important. The farther you go, the faster you will go making the run an ever rising challenge. Your goal is to go as far as you can. After the Y2K bug occurred (computers crashed due to not having into account the change of the millennium), catastrophe unleashed causing nuclear reactors to get unstable and inevitably cause mutations all over the world. Humanity went back to a nearly prehistoric way of living, technology was suddenly unusable the only use we can give to it is to throw it at animals or noise neighbours. After some testing the most efficient piece of technology to throw is the newly released Mokia 3210. What didn't change was the need for humans to eat. In a world where almost every living creature mutated food became the new currency. You are now in charge of hunting and providing for your family don't worry Turtlbbit is tastier than it sounds. After the nuclear catastrophe animals look.. well.. a bit different. Anyway, your job is to hunt them and get as much food as you can for your family. Food can be used to upgrade your 38m2 two floors primitive cave. These upgrades will give you an advantage when running. Ohh, and don't forget that you will be competing against other survivors through Steam leaderboards to see who is the best neo-post-apocalyptic-runner.",
