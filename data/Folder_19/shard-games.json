    "About the game": "Shard Games is a competitive sports game similar to real Olympics on Earth. However, there is one tiny, little difference: it’s fatal. To survive and win, sportsmen and sportswomen, you’ll have to kill each other in a variety of ways but mainly with explosives! What’s more spectacular than a nice explosion? There’s a diversity of game modes for you to try, including TD (Team Deathmatch), FFA (Free for All), CTF (Capture the Flag) – with a lot more to come! Key feature of the gameplay is the weapons that you chose, and the weapons are … bombs! A huge variety of bombs. Help your team by taking a shield generator bomb! Perhaps you prefer to take the enemy down by surprise? Mines! You choose how you’ll pave your way to victory! Prove you’re the one who’s worthy to hold the title for the best sportsman/sportswomen of the Shard Games – the most dangerous sport competitions in the habitable galaxy! Game Features Gameplay is mostly based on killing your enemies with explosives. Simple TDM and DM matches are special game modes which’ll provide you with more unique and interesting gameplay.",
