These power-ups, used in combination with your customized starting ability, will help you fight the next threat that comes your way. Destroying bosses, dodging bullets, and the element of darkness create an action-packed experience that will put your speed, skill, and strategic thinking to the test! Features Infinite gameplay: Fight your way through endless streams of deadlier enemies 4 player local co-op: Recruit friends to help you beat back the darkness 12 special weapons and power-ups Leaderboards: crush your friends’ scores and beat players from around the globe Original adaptive soundtrack Full controller support: enjoy the game with controller of your choice Three difficulty modes: play in casual, normal, or if you dare, nightmare mode",
