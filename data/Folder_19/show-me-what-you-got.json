    "About the game": "How To Play Learning how to juggle can be difficult but with the new Virtual Reality game Show Me What You Got novice or intermediate players are able to put their true juggling skills to the test. Show off your skills in four unique maps, complete with crowds who react to your performance! The objective of the game is to juggle as best as you can to score the most points possible. But three strikes and you’re out: dropping three objects will lose you the game! Players unlock levels by gaining enough points in the previous level. While a strike is earned when an object hits the ground, don’t fret if you aren’t a professional juggler! Players who start on the Easy mode will receive a warning when an object has nearly hit the ground and an opportunity to recover. Normal mode does not have this safety net, but gives players the opportunity for more points! Become the ultimate juggler! Key Features: Two Difficulty Settings Free Play mode that is stress-free: No points, no strikes! Crazy Juggling Items Four Unique Maps Objects close to the ground enter bullet time on easy difficulty A scoring system that rewards you based on your juggling combos",
