Search for “Skool Daze” if you want to find out more about the original. Use a search engine, you know the one, Poodle. No, Snooggle. No Dooogle. Oh, you know what I mean. Meet the main cast :- Eric, Our hero! Boy Wander, The good looking one AngelFace, The bully Einstein, The brains Hayley, The love interest The story unfolds over three difficult levels. Skool Daze. Back To Skool and Nu Skool. In the role of our hero, Eric, you know that inside the staffroom safe are kept the school reports. And, being Eric, you realise that you must at all costs remove your report before it comes to the attention of the Headmaster. The combination to the safe consists of four letters, each master knowing one letter and the Headmaster's letter always coming first. To get hold of the combination, you first have to hit all the shields hanging on the school walls. Trouble is, this isn't as easy as it looks. Some of them can be hit by jumping up. Others are more difficult. You could try and hit a shield by bouncing a pellet off a master's head whilst he is sitting on the ground. Or, being Eric, you may decide to knock over one of the boys and, whilst he's flattened, clamber up on him so that you can jump higher. Having managed to steal your report during the last few skooldaze of term, you've spent the whole holiday forging teachers' signatures and handwriting to make yourself look like the brightest, sweetest natured, most helpful little soul ever to carry a satchel. Now all you've got to do is get it back into the Head's safe… A couple of years ago, your elder brother had exactly the same problem and has lent you his old copy of the School Rules, on which he's scribbled some notes in invisible ink. Holding the paper over a bonfire made from the swot's cap, you work out what to do. You’ve moved to a more modern school. But this hasn’t changed you’re bad behaviour. All records of your exam results and troublesome going ons, are stored in the schools computer database. In order to keep your image as a wonderful and sweet little boy who is always willing to help, you just need to gain access to a computer and delete the database. The elderly brother of one of your new friends, had exactly the same problem and has lent you his old copy of the School Rules, on which he's scribbled some notes in invisible ink. Holding the paper over a bonfire made from the swot's math’s book, you work out what to do. Boys shall attend lessons as shown in the time-table at the top of the screen. (Remember that because you cheated in the exams last year, you always go to the same lessons as the swot.) Boys do not score points by attending lessons, but may be given lines if caught in the wrong place. Boys who acquire over 10,000 lines shall be expelled immediately from the school. Boys are not allowed to enter the staffroom or the Headmaster's study. Take care. At playtime, boys are supposed to be playing and not in any of the classrooms. Boys shall not hit their schoolmates. Boys shall not fire catapults. Boys are expected to walk quietly in the corridors - they are not for running or sitting in. School dinners are compulsory.",
