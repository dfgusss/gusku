    "About the game": "(The game is being completely redesigned with more enemies, bosses, more places to explore and more challenges. Enjoy and buy with the low price) You have been sent to an island where more than four hundred visitors have turned into zombies. In the classic walk and shoot style, eliminate as many zombies as you can and find the rescue site where a helicopter will be waiting. You will hear an alarm every three minutes being issued at the rescue point, so be careful not to get lost. There are several houses on the island where you can find ammunition and protect yourself. You will need to build bridges to pass through some places, be careful not to be attacked by surprise. This is not a game for those who are afraid of the dark and of getting lost in a dense forest full of zombies.",
