    "About the game": "This is a story about Solo-the-Fox. He lived all his life like an average fox cub. But this year, the clouds have gathered... Where trees used to grow and rivers flow, cliffs and sharp slopes have appeared because of strong currents and landslides. What had been underground for centuries was again on the surface… The place which used to be a home has become unrecognizable. You have to get out from this lowland and find a warm, dry and sunny place. Game features: You will encounter various enemies along the way; See places, where no foot has been set for many centuries; Think about how to overcome obstacles on your way; Enjoy relaxing background music; An exciting story with Solo-the-Fox’s comments.",
