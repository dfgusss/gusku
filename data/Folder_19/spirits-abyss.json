    "About the game": "~ In lands long forgotten, stories told of a mountain top that lead to the gates of the Resting Realms. For it was believed a child cast into the abyss under the gaze of the blood full moon may one day return... but that child shall wield the wealth and power over The Undying. ~ Gameplay Spirits Abyss is a roguelite platformer with destructible terrain (or Spelunky-like). Cast into the Mountainous Abysm you must venture into its randomly generated depths battling phantasmic meanies through diverse spookful biomes, meeting curious compadres, and plundering its many useful items and treasures to hopefully find a way back home beyond the Guardian of the Undying Gate... but does something nestle beyond the realmic veil of death? Features 8 game modes to master and unlock. Including online seeded runs where you can compete against the Abysm community, a strategic collectable card battling game, a free play mode where you can use the gold you loot to purchase niceities for future runs, a fast paced arena survival mode, and challenging special trials to overcome! Most game modes also have their own online Steam Leaderboards. How high can your score get, or fancy a speedrun? Each Clan has their own leaderboards to dominate! Same-screen 2 player Co-Op. For double the fun and available for all game modes and Remote Play Together compatible! 9 Clans (7 unlockable) to choose from, each with their own weapons, fighting styles, and upgrade paths! Over 100+ items. From passives that provide general boosts and benefits, to equipable gear where you can use new tools, weapons and weird artifacts! 15 different regions (10 unlockable) to adventure through each with their own enemies, hazards, oddities and challenges! A variety of weird and wonderful sub-stages that alongside the different randomised regions and special rooms helps make each Abyss run feel like a unique experience! Unlockable hats and skin/clothes colour customisations! ~ But perhaps the stories are true? Do the fabled gates really exist? Where may they lead? And who may well dwell in such haunted realms beyond? ~",
