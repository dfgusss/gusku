    "About the game": "As a football fan, you always dream of having the life that many of your idols have thanks to their large annual salaries. Houses, luxuries, parties… There are many things that we all wish we could live and have coming from a small village with few resources. After you stop imagining this dream life and fall into reality, you make the biggest decision of your life when you remember that your aunt and her son live in a big city full of people. A city where you will find more possibilities to reach that dream life you have always wanted. You decide to enroll and start studying, but as time goes by, you find yourself in a different reality. Studying takes a lot of time and will only lengthen the possibility of achieving your dream without the certainty that you will be able to achieve it. As you think about this, you remember that your cousin also has the same mindset that you have, he wants to make money quickly! You don't hesitate to drop out of school and with $1000 in your pocket, you decide to join your cousin in the world of betting. In Sports Betting Simulator, you will have to accomplish certain small missions while you are getting started in this vast world of sports betting. By completing the tasks you will be able to earn income which will increase as you complete more missions, allowing you to rent an apartment, buy a car, get married, start a company, and so on. With that amount of money in your pocket, you can bet on different football leagues, but it won't be as easy as it seems. You have to study the teams and see who has the most possession, who performs better at home, which teams have the best squad and more. All these things will be decisive when it comes to winning big money or losing it all! Sports Betting Simulator features: • Become the best gambler: You will have to place bets in order to complete objectives and move farther in your journey to achieve the life you have always desired. • Many leagues available to choose from: There are ten different leagues to select from, each with a plethora of matches to wager on. Italy, England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Turkey, or Ukraine, choose your favorite league or a mix of several leagues when it comes time to place your bet. • Watch out, you can lose it all!: Use your money wisely to avoid losing it all at once. Not all bets will be winners, so don't be surprised if you lose everything in an eye-opening and eye-closing maneuver. • You have to study: Yes, you drop out of college, but you have to keep studying. Although some luck is involved in the betting, the data and statistics speak for themselves. Whose club is in the best position, which team has scored the most goals this season, how many games they have lost, all of these, and many other factors should be considered before risking your money. • Wait, that team name sounds familiar!: With 10 leagues available, there are many teams to choose from, but you won't come across any familiar names, or maybe you will? You might find Royal Mad Reed and Bar and Sea Loonar in the Spanish league, maybe bet on one of the two MoonCastles in the English league or perhaps bet on an Italian League classic between Me Land and Intra. These and many more funny names can be found on Sports Betting Simulator. In case you lose some of your money, don't worry! The bank will be there to give you a loan, which you will have to use wisely to multiply it and not go bankrupt because all your dreams will be done. Analyze the different football leagues, think well before making any decision, complete your missions and, in a short time, you will be able to get the life you long for in Sports Betting Simulator!",
