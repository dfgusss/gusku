    "About the game": "Square Arena is a multiplayer arena game where each player controls a Ku-Bot and tries to defeat his opponent using one of the various weapons, with very different gameplays, and boosts picked on the ground. But the main characteristic of Square Arena is it's RANDOMNESS: Players will face random rule changes every 30 seconds. Team swapping, weapon switching, bonuses with random effects, environments that impact your movements... Which weapon will you get? Will you play a 2v2, 3v1, 1vAll? You will need fast reflexes and to be able to adapt to any situation in order to defeat your enemies. Square Arena is a multiplayer game but if you're playing solo, you should enjoy the Zombots mode :) TRAILER:",
