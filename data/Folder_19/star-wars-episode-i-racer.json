Rein in a turbine-driven chariot through 8 spectacular worlds. Negotiate through flaming methane lakes, Tusken Raider assaults, ant-gravity tunnels and much more in a pulse-punding, do-or-die fight to the finish where anyone will do anything to cross the finish line. How far will you go? • Relive all the thrill and excitement of the Podracer sequence from STAR WARS: Episode I. • Hang on tight - with afterburners on, Podracers max out at a simulated 600 mph! • Race in furious competition against 21+ opponents. • Take on over 21 tracks on 8 unique worlds! • Avoid hazards such as methane lakes, meteor showers and Tusken Raiders. • Spectacular 3D environments. • Vehicle sound effects and epic soundtrack taken directly from Episode I.",
