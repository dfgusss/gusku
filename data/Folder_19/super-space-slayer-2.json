    "About the game": "Can you save the Galaxy from the comfort of your chair? In Super Space Slayer 2 you can! Shoot demons, dodge bullets and acquire new weapons to defeat the foul demon king Luciferus once and for all! Based on the legendary Google Play title, with re-designed mouse, keyboard and gamepad controls that are even better than the original touchscreen version! Features: 9 unique weapons including the Rapid Laser, Missiles and the Lightning Cannon. There's also special secret weapons only available at certain times of year. Weapons can also drop with mods that affect things like projectile speed, damage and accuracy for even more variety. No matter the weapon, though, just blast the enemies and they'll go down! Beautiful pixel art created by the heroic Daniel Cook. Cheesy storyline inspired by the shareware titles of the early 90s. The Pirate King, demonic cultists and more await in a Galaxy-spanning epic. Original soundtrack composed by Matteo Loderick. Endless Hyperspace mode: Even after you've saved the Galaxy, the fun doesn't stop there. Hyperspace awaits, with more powerful weapons and a never-ending challenge. The deeper you go, the richer the rewards!",
