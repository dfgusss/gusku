Addictive and evolving training minigames to train your character's stats A fast-paced blend of real-time and turn-based combat Face hordes of enemies across the Neverseen and its wild environments Tame pets and meet colorful mercenaries, both to fight beside you Vary your playstyle with six types of weapons, passive skills, and unique rings Upgrade your home and training grounds for stat and experience gain Buy equipment, invest in the local museum, go shopping, fishing and more! Keep playing in the post-game endless mode with randomized encounters Online leaderboard to share your high scores A light-hearted story filled with surprises and humor (The Boss Battle music is based on 'Dark Sanctum' by Visager )",
