    "About the game": "'The Last Will' is a short yet intense adventure game about a grieving father who finds out his estranged son has left him a very special Will. His quest is to fulfill it with an assistant, despite his prejudices. Presented for the first time in 1080p, 'The Last Will' is a 3D point-and-click dramatic adventure game played from the perspective of a grieving father whose son just passed away. 'The Last Will' intertwines a sad (and uplifting) narrative with puzzle-solving gameplay as well as finding hidden items to complete achievements. Using your mouse, you will click (or double click to run) to decide where you want your 3D character to move to, in a 3D world with fixed cameras. Most of the gameplay is going from point A to point B in order to make the story go forward, but at certain times, you will need to find a way to solve a casual puzzle (find a way to solve a kitten, or find a missing briefcase). Although the game is short, you can always save your game to save your progression as well as changing the game options (sounds and music) to your convinence. Featuring an emotional soundtrack and high quality sounds, 'The Last Will' is an intense adventure game drama about the bonds between a father and his son.",
