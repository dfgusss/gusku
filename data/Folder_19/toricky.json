    "About the game": "Toricky is an old-school Action-Adventure game featuring unique mechanics based on fast-flying and physics. Toricky and Momo are two exploring birds, who are always looking for new adventures. They embark on a new quest to a legendary palace where mysterious jewels called 'Crystar' are enshrined. But the palace, which should be busy with people, seemed deserted. What could have happened? Where could everybody have gone? To find the answer to this mystery, you'll have to use Toricky's amazing flying abilities to make your way across many zones filled with dangerous traps, and ferocious enemies! EXPLORATION: Storming a giant fortress surrounded by psychedelic mushrooms, or diving into heavenly waters infested with wacky piranha, this quest is going to be a challenge. Fortunately, Toricky's aerial abilities will let you explore each corner of the Crystar Palace's immense zones! BATTLES: Even if you want to be a peaceful adventurer, the nasty pirates who have overrun this region don't share your same view. As a bird you don't have any weapons, but with Toricky's super strength, the world will become your weapon! Even a pebble could be a lethal weapon in the hands of Toricky! REFLECTION: Many puzzles will block Toricky's path. You'll have to use your wits and the environment around you to solve them. BOSSES: Various bosses will stand in your way. Fighting against a giant robot ten times taller than you? That's a piece of cake for our protagonist! Watch the enemy's movements carefully, find his weaknesses, and strike! WONDERFUL SOUNDS: TORICKY's OST is composed by the legendary composer HIROKI KIKUTA who worked on many video game classics, and DALE NORTH, a talented composer for video games and digital media based in San Francisco. The soundtrack's fantasy taste and use of traditional Japanese instruments are perfectly illustrating Toricky's particular world.

If you can find her, she will be a great help to you on your journey. FEATURES: An Old School designed platformer, illustrated with beautiful hand-drawn sprites.
