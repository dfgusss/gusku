Use different characters, each with own ability, activate traps, choose different routes to leave the opponents behind. Press key shown on screen once to speed up. Not pressing / pressing wrong key / pressing key repeatedly - slows down. Ability requires energy. Energy is also needed for attacks. You can attack other players or gate obstacles if you have no key. Gibbet trap can be activated using energy to drop a stone on head of your opponent. There are usually several routes to go. Some of them are harder, other have useful items. Arrows near signs are showing available options. To jump up, press jump button while walking on the sign. Can be played up to 4 players. With maximum 2 players on keyboard or everyone using controllers. AI can be added to the game. AI is using all types of characters, abilities, traps, and won't miss the chance to attack you.
