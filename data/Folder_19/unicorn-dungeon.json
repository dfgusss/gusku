    "About the game": "Unicorn Dungeon is an absurdist comedy point &amp; click adventure game set in the strange (and often silly) magical land of Artovya, but actually just in a dungeon. This is the first in a series of games which follow the adventures of the brave knight Sir Typhil of Creulor on a quest to bring a unicorn to the castle and be crowned king. As with all of the games in the series, Unicorn Dungeon is mainly a point &amp; click adventure, but with elements of other types of games present as well. In this episode, a section of the game is a rogue-like dungeon crawler. Also, see the sequels: / / / /",
