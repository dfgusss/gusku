    "About the game": "Tayna, a young woman, awakens to a world she doesn’t expect, a life that does not seem to be her own and yet everyone expects something from her – magic nonetheless. They say that she is one of the Chosen but she does not remember, her memories gone as the Alliance have captured her, desperate to use her powers against the Church. And yet how is she to do any of this when no one believes that she does not remember anything of her life? Things are not well and only set to become worse as she is forced through trial after trial in this visual storytelling game. The world you are about to set foot in is afflux in change and Tayna is the crux of it, forced to recognize what is real and what is not, aided by the player in discerning the truth from the lies and, above all, uncovering the true path that she is to follow. Twists and turns on different pathways are not all they seem and her life is no longer simply hers to take in her hands, everything she knows breaking down in a world to be rebuilt, stronger and more powerful than it was before. It is all down to her. Content The gameplay is presented in a visual novel format with a focus on a single large story rather than diverging story paths, more closely resembling a traditional novel. Dialogue options exist to offer you additional insight into the game world, but they do not play a part in changing the course of the game. There are 10 chapters in the game, each containing 5000 words or more. Each of these chapters also contains multiple unique music tracks to help bring the story alive.",
