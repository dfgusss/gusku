    "About the game": "An old legendary hero, Sepsiman, was called to save the world from the evil hands of Kokoman, who wants to spread the Koko Cola disease around the world, making everyone Koko Cola Zombies! Kokoman was too strong, Sepsiman is defeated by him and his disciple Kokogirl, the entire world was covered in Koko Cola, but one girl survived, she was immune to the cola disease! Quickly Sepsiman approaches this girl and gave her the power to transform into a 'soda girl' with his Sepsi bracelet. WHAT HAPPENED?! Instead of a soda girl, she cleansed the toxins of the Sepsi Soda and became VITAMIN GIRL! Sepsiman life it's a stake anyways... sad. Anyways, it's up to VG to cleanse the Koko Cola from this world or even this galaxy! She will clash with Kokoman and Kokogirl and cleanse the toxins running around the the world. -Cute super hero and villain girls doing cute things -Insane difficulty -Arcade Mode, if you have no lives left, you have to start from the start -Nightmare Mode, unlocked after you finish Arcade, a harder version of the game -20 levels lovely handcrafted so the player can enjoy this ride -10 levels in arcade mode and 10 levels in Nightmare mode -Gallery mode, unlock concept art collecting 100/100 cans on each stage. -Did I mention cute girls? Vitamin Girl is a throwback to the old runner and high speed classics. Instead of a generic endless runner, VG has levels completely handmade, not an inch of this game is random generated , every level was created with care to make the player throw the controller to the screen! (Please don't do that...) And not only that, to expand this game even more, it's made to not only run but you also have different modes, slide down the city with a Hover-board, free roam some levels, and even ride a bike ! -Vitamin A Mode: Ride your Armadillo bike, A-kun, and drive through The Soda Way to Kokoman's lair. -Vitamin C Mode: Run, jump, slide down! Run to the goal! -Vitamin E Mode: Ride you Hover-board and slide down through the city and other places to reach your goal! -Vitamin D Mode: Free roam the levels and find the exit.",
