    "About the game": "Frank is having a bad night, he's a Werewolf just trying to get by. He's cornered in a convenience store by a platoon of Hunters, a secretive Mercenary group hell bent on exterminating the Lycan kind. They've been tracking Frank for weeks and now they have him right where they want him, silver bullets in the chamber, but he's not dead yet. A short, blood soaked beat'em'up. Survive the night. FEATURES: -Progressive destruction: Tear through enemies and helpless inanimate produce as the store gets more and more messed up over the course of your battle. -A ludicrous amount of physics objects and particle effects, nearly every item in the store can be displaced. -Move quickly throughout the store, dodging enemy fire and ambushing your attackers. -Quickly chain attacks together for ultimate carnage, score 50 kills to survive the night.",
