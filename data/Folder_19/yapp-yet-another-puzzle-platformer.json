    "About the game": "This is a game for you, if you meet at least three of the following conditions: 1. You like innovative puzzle games. The main idea of YAPP is to make a game full of WOW moments. In most puzzle games, if the game gives you a box, you simply push it somewhere and jump onto it. In YAPP, a box can interact with your two abilities in different ways. In one of the levels you place the box onto your clone and jump onto the box to get higher, later you place your clone onto the box, grab the box and jump, then teleport to your clone and jump again to make a double jump. In another level, you place your clone at the edge of a high ground, grab the box at a lower place and jump and teleport immediately and grab the box which 'jumped' with you. . 2. You like challenging puzzle games. Within the scope of my knowledge, it is one of the most challenging puzzle platformers ever made. (Not one of the most challenging puzzle games. At least it's easier than Stephen's Sausage Roll.) 3. You have played one or two platformers before. The platformer part of this game is not hard for an average player, but still frustrating for newcomers. ('Double jump' included) 4. You can endure my awful artwork and poor English. Features 6 worlds, each has a different theme. 42 unique puzzles, including some challenging ones. 10 stars, even more challenging. Changeable timescale. (helps a lot on the platformer part) Every puzzle is skippable. Except for the level select screen. (Yes, the level select screen itself is also a puzzle.) Several lines adapted from an ancient Chinese philosopher's writings. A big surprise in world 6-7.",
