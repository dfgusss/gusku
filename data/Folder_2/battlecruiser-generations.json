    "About the game": "THE BATTLECRUISER SERIES In celebration of the 25 yr anniversary of the first release, this compendium contains all 4 games in the Battlecruiser 3000AD series which was first released in 1996. Each game is based on the last patch released for it, and is preserved in its original format. Every model, world, feature and bug, are all meticulously preserved in their original state to bring you the true experience of what it was like back in the day. WHAT'S IN THE COMPENDIUM Battlecruiser 3000AD (1996) - DOS (1.01D7C) Battlecruiser 3000AD v2 (1998) - DOS (2.09) Battlecruiser Millennium (2001) - WIN (1.0.03) Battlecruiser Millennium Gold (2003) - WIN (1.01.07) Go back to where it all started and be a part of the history of one of the videogame industry's most recognized brands. All our games released after the original Battlecruiser 3000AD are based on the same rich, expansive world - improved over time and across various titles. While the Battlecruiser games focused on capital ship management, space &amp; planetary exploration, and trading, later titles (Universal Combat and beyond) included even more gameplay action with full first-person mode in space and on planets. You can find those games here on Steam. REQUIREMENTS Each of these games has been restored and tested to work under Windows versions from WIN98 to WIN10. The Windows games can be run as-is under Windows. For Windows 7 and up, you will need to run in Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode. The MS-DOS games require the use of DOSBOX under Windows OS. They can also run in a virtual environment such as VirtualBox with MS-DOS 6.x. You can find pre-built virtual images for MS-DOS or FreeDOS or even build your own image from scratch. Complete setup and runtime docs are provided. MULTIPLAYER All games are single-player only.

PLAY IT YOUR WAY Most games lock you into a linear plot and if you manage to break free and finish the game, you have no choice but to shelve the game and go in search of another to fill the void. In this game you decide how you play, short term, long term or forever. The choice is yours and the variations are endless. With three unique modes of play, you can choose to either wander the universe as a Commander in Earth’s galactic force, Galactic Command, carrying out your duty of maintaining law and order in allied territories or explore the vast reaches of space. You make your own rules but step out of line and face a court-martial or worse, make a bad decision and your crew die. Decide what you want to do, where you want to go and how you’re going to carry out your goals. Do you invade a planet today or join an NPC controlled force as they attack an enemy station deep in hostile territory? Do you mine for valuable Iridium or do you destroy hostile assets for experience points that eventually lead to increase in the ranks? You can also join a campaign in the Advanced Campaign Mode scenario consisting of a series of missions that are directly affected by the ever changing universe. You can either follow the mission path or ignore orders and move on to the next task in the campaign. To get you going and hone your combat skills, enter Xtreme Carnage and take on space and planetary hostiles as you familiarize yourself with the operation of your fighters. The choice is yours, either way, one day, you’re going to die. You may as well die with a medal and for a good cause.",
