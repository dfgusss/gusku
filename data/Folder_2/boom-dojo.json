    "About the game": "Boom Dojo is a rhythm boxing trainer. Targets are generated from your music in realtime. You color match targets to your hands and avoid bar contact which hurts your score. The score is dynamically calculated as your hits / the current total of emitted targets. Target rate is tied to your score so higher scores will yield more targets from a track. The better you play the more detail you 'squeeze' out of the music hardening the game. LIV is also fully supported allowing you to capture your amazing workouts in mixed reality.",
