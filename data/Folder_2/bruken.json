    "About the game": "Bruken? That's a weird name... Well when you get into the world, you'll see that it's all in pieces! Also... Gravity has flipped? (Doesn't it normally drag you inwards??) Well.. when you see this world you'll think 'Aww! It's all bruken! Everything's bruken! The world's bruken! Gravity is bruken! Goodness gracious me!'. :) Explore this exciting new world as a little ball. I do believe that whatever caused this place to break apart like this has left lots of energy around the place. I wonder if that'll help you to overcome the ever stronger gravitational force as you get closer to the center! Hmm! Either way, it's just a bit of fun! Have an explore, do the jumps, poke around the maze (or on top of the maze!) and generally just enjoy yourself. I made this game with one goal in mind. A relaxing and fun game to play when you're keen to chill out in the afternoon (or whenever you relax really) with a bit of difficulty at the end/middle. Good luck with that by the way, gravity can be a real pain in the butt! Features: - A big ol' hand crafted world to explore (not just procedural planes....) - All sorts of things to jump on/off/over/into/etc. - A movement system with slight complexity to it (if you figure it out, there are a few different ways to do things). - Energy system (the more you have, the better/faster/stronger na na na na what don't kill me, can only make me stronger, wait, what was I saying?) - Plenty of waypoints etc. - Fun, excitement, joy, bliss, the meaning of life, candy, a brand new Porche 911 2018 model with turbo chargers AND superchargers, hand crafted by angels and painted by famous artists long dead. - Alright that last one may have been a stretch but... sales, amirite?",
