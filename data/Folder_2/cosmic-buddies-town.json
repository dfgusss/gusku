    "About the game": "Cosmic Buddies Town is a trip into a colourful living ecosystem, where our friendly characters work together to build their new home. Part of an Animated Educational series for children between 1 to 7 years old – this time, we need to get straight to work helping the Cosmic Buddies build their town! Collect wood, food and other resources to turn a deserted island into your dream adventure land! Kids will love the colourful cast of monsters who will join them in creating their own personalised town. Each character brings a different set of important values for children: friendship, love, respect and teamwork. In addition, fun minigames will help children to develop memory, reflexes and shape identification. The story of Cosmic Buddies begins on Titius, which is located between Neptune and Pluto, 50.4 astronomical units from Earth. Titius is a world full of biodiversity, beauty, peace, respect and love. Titians have existed for a very long time, many years before humans. They are colourful, smart and small. One day six Titians - Grutius, Bobotius, Lili, Ned, Goratius and Maca are playing together when a mysterious object appears in the sky. The friends aren't frightened; they are curious and keen to find out more about the object. Suddenly without any warning, there is a big bright flash and the friends are magically transported to planet Earth. Grutius and Rox (his balloon) Aspect: Sweet Height: Miniature Temperament: Grumpy Among the Tituans, Grutius belongs to the smallest of the species. He has the personality traits of a boss and can be authoritarian sometimes. He tends to be defensive and doesn’t trust easily, often reacting to a situation with a negative outlook. He will need to learn to be more optimistic, acquire a positive mind in order to build a more positive future. He also needs to learn to be more patient and more trusting of people and his friends. Grutius believes that being optimistic is a waste of time and prefers to think negatively in order to avoid disappointments. He can also be lazy and believes that work is too hard; you will often find him sitting around while the others work. Grutius can be proud and sometimes unfriendly but if you treat him well, he can become docile and even shy sometimes, especially around Lili. He can lack self-esteem and is in need of love and affection. His loyal friend is Rox the balloon. Rox has an enquiring mind and is eager to learn. He likes to investigate and asks lots of questions. He is keen to find out how they mysteriously arrived on Planet Earth, but his curiosity doesn’t end there, he also wants to find out more about the meaning of life and the universe. Rox has a sweet attitude and children will find him adorable and easy to fall in love with. Bobotius Jr. Aspect: Gentle Height: Tall (like Bigfoot) Temperament: Passive and Sweet A long time ago the Bobotius were once considered as slaves on Titius. As a species they are harmless and humble and Bobotius Jr. is Grutius’s friend. He has many of the characteristics that Grutius should aspire to. He doesn’t talk very much, but is very intelligent and he’s a little in love with Lili, even if they are just friends. Bobotius Jr. will learn how to grow up and take risks when needed. He will show us that he can become a leader and that good always triumphs over bad. He is the protector of the group and all his friends sleep in his warm arms every night to feel safe. Lili Aspect: Quirky, colourful, open and attractive Height: Tall and thin Temperament: Impulsive, outgoing, charming, passionate and flirtatious Lili is the only girl, she is very smart and loves to read and learn about new things. She is enthusiastic and always sees the positive side of life, but can be temperamental and gets angry sometimes. She is a passionate monster who helps the group by devising strategies to get back home or to achieve their goals on Earth. She always carries her shoes around because she has not learned how to put them on yet. Ned and Lili are always together trying to find solutions to their problems. She will eventually fall in love with Ned because they share the same point of view, interests and passion for physics and chemistry. Lili is on the look out for her soulmate and later in the story she will find them; it will be the person who helps her to tie her shoelaces. She will learn how to be brave in tough situations, how to cook and find food to take care of herself and her friends. Lili will discover a passion for movies and will go to Hollywood to achieve success and fame as an actress. Ned Aspect: Very smart Height: Normal Temperament: Humble Ned is nerdy, he loves science and technology and playing videogames. He is a descendant from the planet Neptune known for their great achievements in science and at a very young age he already had the knowledge of a physicist. He is sweet but shy and sometimes doesn’t know how to express his feelings. In the story, Ned will learn how to express his emotions, control his bad behavior and help to discover the reason why they are on Earth. He believes that we were all made from the coming together of small particles of energy after the universe was created. He will share his beliefs with Lili and his friends to create a galaxy transporter in the hope they can get back to Titius and tell their parents all about the great adventures they had on planet Earth. Ned will be the one who tells his friends all about new technologies and he will be the first one to take a flight to discover another continent. Goratius and Maca Aspect: Gorilla Height: Very Big Temperament: Rude Goratius and Maca are bound together by a belt; they are inseparable and can’t live without each other. Goratius is Maca’s bodyguard. After the bright flash happened and they were transported to Earth, they were the only ones that suffered radiation poisoning from the secondary effects of space warp. After this, they become evil and start to spend all their time thinking about how they can cause harm to everyone. In the story they will start to feel guilty about their behavior and try to improve themselves and become better friends. When they are mean, their colour is dark and when they are good their colour is bright. Maca looks like a bat. Before the story ends they will eventually learn that being good is better than being bad. They will win the fight to suppress their urge to do bad things, which will make them become stronger. However, even though they are friends they will sometimes rebel against each other. During their adventures around the world they will they learn to speak new languages. They will also learn how to be respectful, how to share and how to love each other.
