    "About the game": "This simulator will allow you to destroy a small (really huge) building. But you will do it with epic explosions that will demolish everything in its path. You will be given a choice of different shells with different firepower, but take care using them. Weaponry Tired of all this explosions? Use earthquake, tornado, different cannonballs or even blackhole... Hmm found it boring - change its power. Each gun has custom parameters that can be changed. Set timer on all charges and watch them explode one by one at 1 button press Gravity Took it all from freezing time... Well, play with low / high gravity or just turn it off like you are in space ;) Fire system Of course wood burns! Why wouldn't it? XD Maps Play over 50 built-in maps Create one yourself as well in the editor! Pick any terrain you want to play on: Sand, Grass, Moon or Destructible terrain Gameplay Full control of gameplay - fly as a ghost player or switch to a physical body, slow down the time freeze it, change gravity, increase debris amount and enable additional debris effect, increase/reduce objects HP or the force they hold to each other, and much more...",
