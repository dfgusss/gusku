    "About the game": "Dice Defenders is a new take on the classic tower defense game genre. It uses dice mechanics from table top games to remove some of the standard battle of attrition and maximizing dps and instead provides a new type of challenge revolving around resource management and the players ability to manipulate the statistical probabilities at play. 4 types of towers - each with their own unique abilities, upgrade trees, and ultimate abilities 4 sizes for each type of tower - each with a unique attack zone (that can be upgraded) specific to that tower type and size combination 6 types of dice as found in a standard tabletop gaming dice set - used to modify towers and are used in combination with other dice based on the towers size There are 5 maps to complete each with their own set of 20 waves. Will you be the first to complete them all??",
