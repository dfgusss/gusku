    "About the game": "Explodemon combines the retro style of 16-bit platform games and Japanese action titles with the upgradable skills, hidden collectables and clever puzzles from more modern titles. Players use Explodemon's self-destructive nature to combat enemies and fly through the air, all the while solving a huge variety of physics-based puzzles. With twelve huge levels, full keyboard and controller support, upgradable skills and a full set of achievements and collectables to discover, Explodemon captures the essence and nostalgic feel instantly recognisable from SNES-era platformers with the depth and variety of more recent indie platform titles. Features: • Explore 12 gigantic levels of intense platforming action set across three diverse worlds • Adapt to a constantly changing gameplay experience with new skills and hazards aplenty! • Evolve Explodemon into your own personal destruction machine with upgradable skills • Countless collectables and 20 achievements add a modern depth to the retro style • Enjoy a comic story told with suitable aplomb and panache! • Full controller support",
