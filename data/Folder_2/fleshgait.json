    "About the game": "At 12:03 AM, September 16th, Damien Mara mysteriously vanished on a camping trip. At 10:00 AM October 1st, the search for Damien was officially called off with no evidence found. Fleshgait is a hybrid survival horror experience. Play the game with fixed camera angles / panning cameras, or at any time, switch into a 3rd person over the shoulder perspective. Puzzle and item placement dynamically shift, so each playthrough is slightly different. The game's event system randomly places jump scares based on the player's progression. 'The Stigmatized' are a zombie-like enemy which can be put into a dormant state by receiving damage but can only actually be killed by the use of fire. Explore, solve puzzles, and conserve resources. Puzzle and item placement vary on each playthrough. Realtime menu-less inventory for maximum immersion. Traditional &amp; dynamic camera system switches between static cameras and panning cinematic cameras. At anytime players can switch into a 3rd person over the shoulder perspective. Fire weapons must be used to fully defeat 'The Stigmatized'. Flammable boards and furniture block your path. They can be destroyed with your weapons, but to converse your resources it is much wiser to use fire. Multiple endings. Dynamic jump scare systems. Eight unique enemy types. Unlockable modes, weapons and costumes.",
