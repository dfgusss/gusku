    "About the game": "Overview Hexvade is a competitive, action-packed combination of the classic falling-block style arcade game and the timeless platformer genre. Fight your friends in this fast-paced and strategic game! And fear not, for the lone wolves out there we have a boss-rush styled singleplayer mode, battling your way through 7 uniquely designed and challenging bosses! Multiplayer Multiplayer is the core element of Hexvade, as what is more fun than having your hard work destroyed by a friend, and then getting to smash them in the head with bricks later on? The concept is simple: one player plays as the Dropper and the other as the Dodger. The Dropper must align pieces to create lines in order to make the Dodger vulnerable to hazards. The Dodger must sabotage the game board using a plethora of items and abilities, and dodge their way around pieces when the Dropper manages to create a line. Game ends if the Dodger is killed or trapped, or if the Dropper fails to clear pieces and they get stacked too high. If the timer runs out, the victory goes to the Dodger for being able to survive the onslaught. With 8 Dropper and 8 Dodger characters, each with their own passive and active ablities as well as a wide range of items, there's never a dull moment! Singleplayer Should you find yourself alone one rainy day and have a hankering for hexagonal-based destruction, there is a singleplayer mode for you try your hand at! Fight your way through 7 unique and challenging bosses and get awarded points for speed, accuracy, and control! These points will unlock new characters for Multiplayer, and you also get to brag online that you're 3 frames faster at beating a boss than someone else! Demo If you're still unsure if Hexvade is for you, be sure to try out our free demo! It has Local Multiplayer with 2 characters for both the Dropper and the Dodger, as well as 1 singleplayer boss for you to attempt! Conclusion A game for both casuals and competitors alike, Hexvade is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end (providing you don't get salty at your friend who's far better than you and rage quit).",
