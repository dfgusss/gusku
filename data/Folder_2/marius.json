    "About the game": "Marius is the first VR experience of the newly founded VR Studio 'Granola Studios'. It’s meant as a demo to show the visual and interactive capabilities of the team. In the beginning the player is welcomed by Marius where the team shows it’s capabilities of high-quality animation in VR. The VR experience immerses the player in a huge library which can be fully explored. While the player walks around and plays with objects laying around Marius is moving his trolley around. As VR is not only about gaming but also about creating artificial and believable environments this VR experience shows the visual capabilities of today’s VR. It’s a great entry-level experience for all casual or even non-gamers who just have purchased a VR headset and want to check out some great environments and experiences.",
