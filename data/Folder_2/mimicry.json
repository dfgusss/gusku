    "About the game": "Mimicry is a minimalist 2D puzzle-platformer where you control 2 characters at once in 100 levels. However, one character's controls are inverted, so each level feels like a puzzle. - Control 2 characters that move in opposite directions at the same time. - Oh! One of those characters ALSO has reversed gravity. - Play 100 levels with 5 boss fights that will test your puzzle-solving and platforming skills. - A very unique final boss fight that is not like most out there. - Not a gamer? No problem! The game's training wheels help you get ready to complete your journey. - You are a gamer and want challenging puzzles? No problem! Good luck! - Minimalist art and relaxing music to help cut the tension in the tougher stages. Update : To backout in the home menus, press “Backspace” on PC or “Delete” on MAC. Gamepad controllers is my preferred way to play",
