    "About the game": "Moon River is a single player brain-twisting puzzle-platformer where the player is locked in the boundaries of the screen. When they cross any of its edges, they find themselves teleported to the opposite side of the screen. Across 7 levels , the player will face distinctly challenging sets of unique puzzles that get increasingly complex as the game progresses. Featuring rich, carefully-crafted art and an achingly beautiful soundtrack, Moon River is a game bound to burrow deep in any puzzle lover's mind. The game is playable on MacOSX , PC and Linux and is playable with xBox controller or keyboard .",
