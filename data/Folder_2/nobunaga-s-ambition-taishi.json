We offer the grandest warring states experience to all the fans out there! (Resolve System) Each clan is set apart due to their various 'Resolves.' We will shine a light on the Resolve of each officer, bringing out diversity in the game play and strategies. The simulation AI has evolved, allowing players a greater sense of immersion in fighting more humanlike Daimyo. (New Strategy) The Civil &amp; Diplomatic systems have been revamped. With a variety of elements new to the series, the player's eye for strategy will be tested. The new evolved Civil &amp; Diplomatic systems show greater depths. (Final Battles) Clash during the 'Order/Advance phase,' where players try to anticipate their enemies' movements. We use a simultaneous plot system to show the fun of anticipating your opponent and real, high tension battles. (Volume) Lots of officers. Over 2,000 officers appearing and a single high definition 3D map. (Historical Drama) We shine a light on the lives of the officers in this best of all historical dramas. We have included many events showing historical events, stories, and even regional folklore.",
