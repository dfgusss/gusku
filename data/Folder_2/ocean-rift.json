    "About the game": "Ocean Rift is the world's first VR aquatic safari park. Explore a vivid underwater world full of life including dolphins, sharks, orcas, turtles, sea snakes, rays, manatees, sea lions, whales, and even dinosaurs!* Ocean Rift features 12 habitats ready for you to explore. Environments range from coral reefs, mangrove swamps and shipwrecks, to the deep sea, Arctic and Atlantis. Activate the education mode to learn more about the animals you come across. There are over 40 fully narrated information points to find. Ocean Rift 's star animals are animated using an advanced procedural animation system. Its aim is to produce life-like behavior, and display some of the range of motion and dexterity shown by real-life equivalents. Dolphins for example will twist, twirl and swim through hoops in an endless variety of ways, ensuring that no two visits to Ocean Rift will be the same! * (Well, technically extinct prehistoric reptiles)",
