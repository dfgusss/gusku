    "About the game": "Hi there! I'm Odyssee , but since we are friends you can call me Ody . First: my adventure it's a mix of genres. I'll be fighting like the Italian plumber in: platform levels; enigma dungeons; the only underwater level you'll ever like to play in a 2D game. We're friends, huh? Well, I suppose. If not... I don't care. If you are, I don't care, but thank anyway. I work as a coffee machine. Yeah, press 'K' and you will taste my fabolous 'Kaffee'. I was born in a far away galaxy, a long time ago. In a robo-civilization. My name sealed my fate. A lifetime adventure was in my destiny. In 1944, a nazi robot legion was sent to conquer my world, using a time machine. The nazi expedition was a success and my robot-girlfriend (a rogirl) was kidnapped. I tried to defend her by the evil nazis! But I even lost one of his eyes in the fight. Damn! It's high time you help me to find my girlfriend. Starting from her bra. Yeah, thos nazi-robots were a little bunch of perverts. And, huh, so am I.",
