The first time period is in the 1920s and focuses on a small fishing community and the horror that is released upon their island. The second time period takes place in present-day and focuses on a paranormal research group, with their own television show, heading to the island to film their season finale. Once they arrive they encounter the evil that was let loose upon the island, long ago. The story branches at points and different scenes are available based on your choices.
