    "About the game": "Overheat is a hard sidescrolling platformer in which a robot only needs to climb up one level to return to its home planet. How hard can that be? There may be a few minor obstacles on the way up: and maybe some less nice fellows: But that shouldn't be too much of a problem, right? Oh, did we mention that the robot is not allowed to stop? No? Well, if the robot stops for a short time, it will OVERHEAT , explode and spawn at the beginning! How many robots will you need?",
