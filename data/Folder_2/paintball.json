    "About the game": "This is a first-person shooter where characters shoot balls that leave bright colors. Here you don't need to hit the player many times to knock him out. One hit and goodbye. Currently in the game: 2 characters (human and robot) 6 game maps 2 game modes - team and deathmatch (with round or with respawn) I plan to make updates in the game to add new maps and game modes. So far, you can only play with bots, but if the game will be popular, then perhaps there will also be multiplayer. In team mode, you can select number of bots in your team and in the enemy squad. And in deathmatch, you can select the number of bots on the map. Standard control: WASD - move Space bar - jump C - crouch Mouse click - shooting Tab - show/hide statictics The game is free. At the moment, the game has a New Year's game mode, where players shoot snowballs.",
