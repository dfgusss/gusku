    "About the game": "The spirit of the forest, Tikiman, is in trouble. An army of mysterious monsters has invaded his peaceful forest! Repel the fire and fury of your assaulting foes! Build towers within the woods and level them up to vanquish the invaders! Protect the Chibis, the future of the Tiki tribe! GAME FEATURES Protect the Chibis! Evil monsters have invaded the peaceful Tiki forest! Protect the 20 Chibis back home at all costs! Waves? Like Surfing? Monsters attack in several groups at a time, like intermittent waves. The number of 'waves' may differ depending on the stage selected. Fire Away! Use magic to transform the trees around you into towers that attack the monsters. These towers cost hard-earned coins and gems to build. It seems that even magic requires money to use... Unlock Stages Oh! Looks like new numbered plates appear near altars when you successfully protect the Chibis within each stage! 1... 2... 3... And they seem to appear in order, huh. Rainbow Fragments If you protect all your Chibis, you get special rainbow fragments as a reward. Collect them all to visit Tiki houses in other areas!",
