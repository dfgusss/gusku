    "About the game": "Project Toon Tanks Welcome to Project Toon Tanks! Epic battle arenas where two players (or one player and an AI if you are ... taking a break) fight to the death. Project Toon Tanks has a wide selection of customizable and historically inaccurate vehicles from the mighty KV-2 to the deadly Armata going head to head in ludicrously obnoxious battles. That's right! Nothing is historically accurate here! Vehicles and Customization: Chose a Tank from the roster of awesome war machines and customize them by painting your tanks with one of the over 50 different camouflage patterns available. Abrams Ariete Armata BMP Bradley Maus Merkeva M60 Patton PL-01 Starship Hetzer Challenger Leopard 1 Leopard 2 Leclerc Type 59 E-100 T-90 T-95 IS-3 IS-4 T-29 KV-2 Strv 103B Power Ups: What make a battle intense?
