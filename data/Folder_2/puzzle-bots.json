    "About the game": "There’s a big secret at Dr. Hugo’s Factory for Making Robots. When the inventors aren’t looking, their tiny robots go on big adventures. They never expected to stumble onto a plot so diabolical it threatened their very existence. With lasers. It all starts when Zander - possibly the world’s most absent-minded inventor - trips over a metal box buried outside the factory. When no-one can figure out how to open it, the robots sneak out and try it for themselves. What they discover is the first step to a grand adventure, leading to a mystery as old as the factory itself. Join the robots as they outwit mischievous children, curious animals, and dysfunctional inventors in their quest to find the truth. Will the robots solve the mystery before it’s too late? Find out by visiting Dr. Hugo’s factory yourself! Key features: Play as 5 different robots, each with their own abilities and quirky personalities Help the bots work together as a team to solve puzzles Bomb, burn, push and swim your way through 17 intricately designed levels Explore the hidden secrets of a crazy robot factory Unwittingly meddle in the humans’ lives",
