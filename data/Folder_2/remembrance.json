    "About the game": "Artist Alya wakes up on the banks of a river with no memories and only a journal, painting supplies, and a ticket for a train that leaves in 5 days. You have until then to recover her memories. And with every choice changing what you remember... Good luck! Features Pixel-style aesthetics keeps focus on story Simple controls, but not a simple plot Story-centric RPG where every choice you make changes how the game plays out Each playthrough takes around 2 hours to complete, but multiple playthroughs are necessary if you want to uncover the whole story No combat, but plenty to do... you play as an artist after all Warning There are some passing mentions of disturbing elements (such as death). However, nothing gruesome or in-depth is shown or talked about.",
