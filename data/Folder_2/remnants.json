You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, latency issues, bugs and incomplete features. I will try my best to target latency issues to improve the quality of online gameplay the best I can. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience, I would recommend letting the game develop more before trying it out. There are YouTube videos of gameplay showing the current state of the game. Remnants has been solely developed by myself and I've always taken passion in working on it, I feel this is important to mention, so those considering purchasing Early Access can make a more informed decision. Goals of the project: The aim was to create a game that wasn't overly complicated but also provided a strategy-based experience that offered challenges and an overall goal and purpose to playing, rather than just looting and shooting. I wanted the game to be as balanced as possible in PvP while also offering decent PvE content. Remnants requires an internet connection to authenticate to steam!",
