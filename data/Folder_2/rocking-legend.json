    "About the game": "Rocking Legend is a musical game where you take the part of a virtual rock star, immersed in beautiful and dynamic environments. Choose your instrument (guitar or drums) and participate in the single-player campaign through a series of levels and original soundtracks created for the game, to improve your skills and unlock new skins for your instruments. Compete over the global leaderboards with your preferred control scheme and a selection of gameplay modifiers in the free-play mode. You can also play with custom songs (support for external .chart or .mid maps made with external tools). 3 ways to control the guitar: Finger tracked (only index controllers at the moment) fingers can interact individually with the frets over the virtual guitar's fretboard while strumming with the plectrum on the other hand. Both left and right-handed guitar models are available. Hand tracked (Index/Vive/Oculus or others) Classic mode : the easiest way to play. Slide on the fretboard and strum with the plectrum while holding a single fret Advanced mode : an advanced mode with directional notes. Slide on the fretboard and strum with the plectrum while pressing the fret with the corresponding arrows (trigger, grip, or trigger + grip) PC Keyboard / Physical devices embrace your pc keyboard like a physical guitar, or plug in your preferred PC/Console guitar or game controller Play with drums: Grab your virtual drumsticks and play with a complete drumset.
