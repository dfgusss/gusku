    "About the game": "You play as a new member in the Smithworks Guild named Smitta. She has always dreamed of becoming like the legendary smiths of the past. Their legacy and contributions led to their peaceful present time. However, it would seem that the guild was not as she had hoped for with it's questionable business practices and treatment of customers. Same-day blacksmithing? You have to be joking. Surely, it will get better right? Hop on with your fellow blacksmiths and friends and get through these blacksmithing contracts together. Smithworks is a team-based game that focused heavily on communication to succeed. How players decide to work together is up to them and every strategy is valid. Of course, you don't need to be perfect to succeed. In the words of the guild: 'If it looks right, then the customer won't notice'. Work in real time against the clock, to handle the heat of the customers coming in. Choose what orders to prioritize and how to do them to keep the guild and the customers happy. Features: Up to 4 player co-op Steam Achievements Voice Chat Procedurally Generated Orders Altered Levels for 1, 2, 3-4 player lobbies",
