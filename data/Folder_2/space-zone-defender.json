Depending on the sales are future updates planned for more enemies, more game modes, more upgrades and also other control systems likes mouse control in some modes. Before you buy it please ensure you know... that this is a little minigame and not a AAA game. You can see what you get in the screenshots and the video. The game can change with more content in the future. I tested all features, the achievements and highscores and tried to secure that all works without problems.
