    "About the game": "A friendly state at a geographically significant point in the world has fallen into chaos, with terrorists and insurgents taking advantage of the confusion to take cities for their own and destabilize the region. Take command of a NATO special operations force to provide assistance and help the country take its territories back and restore stability to the region. SPECWAR Tactics is a simple game that lets you build up your ideal special operations team and send them off on operations, utilizing stealth, CQB tactics, and fire and maneuver to overcome numbers.

Customize your soldiers, utilizing multiple different spec ops units with their own specialties, to create your perfect special operations team.

Utilize stealth, flanking, and suppression that allow you to overcome greater numbers through superior tactics Fight on missions that feature both open environments that require infantry tactics to get past, as well as more condensed interior environments for CQB action. Note: Though I didn't set it as early access, I do intend to continue to fix/improve the game and add some more content after release.
