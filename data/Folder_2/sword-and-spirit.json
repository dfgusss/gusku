    "About the game": "Adventurer! After searching far and wide, you have finally found the mysterious labyrinth of legend! You braved its long corridors and finally found your glorious treasure: a sword that grants eternal life. Now all you have to do is find your way out of the labyrinth. Fight enemies and collect 'insight' from past fallen adventurers to open new pathways through the labyrinth! Note: The game was developed by students for Baylor University's gaming capstone class. Key Features: Fun Combat: Learn the enemy attack patterns and utilize your dash and targeting abilities to defeat the enemies trying to stop you from escaping! Unique Loot: Gather forbidden knowledge and open new doorways by talking to the spirits of past adventurers! Collect Insight: Equip different combinations of gems dropped by enemies to upgrade your sword and become more powerful! Special thanks to these people for helping us create our game: Nic Townsend (music) Daniel Clute (help with 3D modeling and animations) Meghan Roesler (menu art)",
