    "About the game": "What is Synth Run? Simply put, a fast paced, difficult, speed freak, music thumping, reaction time testing runner game! Play as a speedy ship cruising through the void and avoiding obstacles, while performing some sick flips that would make Tony Hawk proud. The game has 7 main levels, excluding the tutorial, varying in difficulty, aesthetic, layout, and skills needed to complete it. Each level will test you on something different and brings a little chaos to the table of a lonely ship drifting through the black. Be that reaction time, fine movement control, aerial control, rhythm, memory, planning and more! Key features - Fast paced - High skill ceiling - Thumping soundtrack - Challenging level design - Synthwave Aesthetic",
