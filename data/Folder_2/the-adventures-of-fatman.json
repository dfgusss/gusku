    "About the game": "To the Fat Mobile, let's go !! You are the crime fighter for the city of Shadowlawn. Just when you're complaining about how dull things have been, a supervillain named Toxicman is created from a botched act of corporate sabotage. It is up to you, then, to tear yourself away from food long enough to save the city from certain destruction... There is fun, laughs and even some heroic moments to be had in The Adventures of Fatman: Toxic Revenge! Now available at budget price for Steam collectors, the first commercial AGS game returns to your screens. This special edition includes extra easter eggs &amp; an improved ending. Additional special features, trading cards &amp; soundtrack are also included! Yesterday's technology, today !! + Comedy adventure game suitable for all (some mild comic violence) + Parody point &amp; click with a retro kick + Full English voice acting + Interesting locations to visit &amp; fun characters to meet + Hand-drawn art &amp; animations, original soundtrack + Designer commentary in-game + Easy mode (normal, hints &amp; retries) or hard mode (no saves, no hints + sudden death) The Adventures of Fatman: Toxic Revenge was originally released in 2003, the first videogame made with Adventure Game Studio to be sold commercially. This version is the 2007 re-release or 'special edition' (mostly fixes and refinement of the original version). We recommend players with modern operating systems to use Windowed mode (which can be set to large/HD sizes).
