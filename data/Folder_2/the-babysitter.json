    "About the game": "In The Babysitter you play Alice, a young girl looking after a five years old child, Johan, while his parents are out for dinner. What started as a normal babysitting job, soon turns into an incredible adventure after Johan has gone missing. Guide Alice through a fantasy world filled with traps and puzzles and uncover the truth of why Johan went there. The gameplay consists of puzzles and minigames, where time management and focus on dialogues are essential. Key features include: * Short game/story (about 1 hour). * Puzzles with randomized solutions. Play multiple times and try to unlock all achievements! * Choices matter. You decisions in the first part of the game have consequences in the rest of the story. * An easy mode is available for the casual players and an hard mode for the bravest ones (not recommended for first playthroughs). * Steam Achievements (Windows only). Keyboard AND mouse are both required to play the game. If you want some tips or need help, see the discussions in the Community Hub!",
