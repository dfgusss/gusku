    "About the game": "Periodically, pilots from around the world gather to challenge each other, taking turns completing a danger-filled course, hoping to dominate the leaderboard. Your team is making the final preparations. The band is setting up to perform. And your ship ”The Blue Flamingo” is ready in the hangar. Before we delve further into The Blue Flamingo , we hope you don't mind us taking this opportunity to tell you about our latest game, the Tiny Multiplayer Online RPG Book of Travels! / About The Blue Flamingo : The Blue Flamingo is a straight forward, bite size, Shoot 'em up game created entirely using handmade models. A 32 feet long handcrafted model was built specially for the game, along with countless props and assets that were filmed and photographed. All the effects, rocket flares and explosions were created using firecrackers and other pyrotechnics. Like every other Shmup, this is a game that challenges you to reach the highest possible score. This is made interesting by an economical system that allows you to invest your score in upgrades, which makes earning more score points easier. On the other end, you are rewarded with interest on what is left of your score when you progress to the next level. You have to make a choice - to upgrade and try to regain the score, or rely on your skills to beat the increasingly difficult levels. Use your greed wisely to beat your friends and climb up the score table.",
