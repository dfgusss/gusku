    "About the game": "At a luxury hotel on Jupiter's second-largest moon, a political figure was murdered along with three others. With the crime scene empties, you—a member of an interstellar police force—are the investigator of these deaths. Collect evidence, interview witnesses, analyze clues, and solve puzzles to uncover the secrets behind the events leading up to this crime. Discover The Callisto's seedy history, explore the staff and guests' backroom connections, and learn about the underground financiers of this remote paradise on the cold surface of a moon. Based on the lore of the 2017 tabetop RPG Cold Start , The Callisto combines the puzzles of an escape room with an interactive storyline and deep lore, and a dynamic puzzle system to make each playthrough unique. Unique visuals push the boundaries of VR and immerse you in a dystopian sci-fi future.",
