However, when Alvis hears that the dark wizard possesses an unhatched dragon’s egg, he realizes he’s played right into the BONE KING’s plans to gain access to the hidden realm and perform a ritual that will give the dark one absolute power over the seven Cosmic Forces. Desperately needing to contain this threat, but weakened by battle, the wizard reluctantly takes on the fledgling dragon, Frigg, as his apprentice and charges her with clearing out the dungeons and dispatching this evil force once and for all.",
