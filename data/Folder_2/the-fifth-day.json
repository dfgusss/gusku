    "About the game": "The Fifth Day is a post-apocalyptic survival game set in the time after mankind's extinction to the machines that it created. Your role, as one of these machines, is to survive in the hostile world left behind by man. Explore, build, and hack your way to victory in competitive online survival, or face the wastes alone in offline freeplay mode. Key Alpha Features Explore a world left by man, where rogue AI roam the lands previously inhabited by their creators and masters. Explore dense forests, radioactive wastes, and abandoned cities in hopes of finding resources and surviving to the next day in this desolate world. Join competitive online play. Survive alone or with a partner through a series of five days to come out on top as the superior machines of the new world. Elimination by death brings the challenge to a whole new level as players are removed from the competition after being destroyed. Win online matches to upgrade your character's skills and become the most feared and dangerous machine left behind in this new world. Find resources and construct your own settlement. Build anything from small wooden encampments to get you through the night to reinforced bunkers with automated defenses to protect against intruding AI. In order to power your mechanical being, you will need to find and manage power sources that each bring different advantages as well as costs to using them. Hack enemy AI to follow your commands or support you in your ventures. Face the wastes alone in single player freeplay where all you have is your own strength and willpower to survive in this post-apocalyptic world.
