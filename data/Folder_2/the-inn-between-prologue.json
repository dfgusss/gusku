    "About the game": "Discover a dark new fantasy world in The Inn Between , a turn-based, tactical RPG with strong elements of exploration and many opportunities to forge your own path. The Prologue Chapter is a roughly 8 hour experience crafted to be the launching point of The Inn Between series. The Prologue Chapter is a standalone experience and progress will not carry over to future chapters in the series, however it will give you an idea as to what future chapters can be. Which is why we have decided to release this chapter for free. We want to start to build a community around this game so feel free to join the game’s discord to provide us with useful feedback(Linked in the sidebar). The Prologue Chapter is a great introduction into the world and lore we are building and you will be able to become acquainted with some characters who will be present in The Between . We look forward to working with the community as we move forward with development of Chapter One . At its core, ' The Inn Between ' is a uniquely styled role-playing game with turn-based combat and rich storytelling. Build each party member however you like, solve puzzles, craft items, and slash your way through a variety of enemies. There are lots of secrets to find in The Between so be sure to check every nook and cranny. The world is filled with new things to discover and often times branching off the main path will have you finding new items, characters, quests and more! Enjoy a large selection of tactics style combat encounters that are sprinkled throughout the game world. Every turn matters as you attack, reposition and heal your squad, leveraging your own build style against a variety of encounters. Swords, shields, guns, wands and more are at your disposal, as well as a fair selection of abilities for each type of weapon. Use these tools and more to manage each conflict by dealing damage directly or by trapping the battlefield with hazardous terrain. Follow the story of Cryptor, who has woken up in a world somewhere between life and death. Meet new party members and slowly unravel the secrets of The Between, a world where lost souls arrive without much guidance, left to discover their own true selves.",
