    "About the game": "This is actually the simplest game. Everything in this game is simple! Do you want a deeply thought-out plot? --- It's not here! (Or at least it shouldn't be ) Do you want to enjoy heavenly graphics at 4K, 60 FPS? --- What are you talking about? It's a 2D platformer with pixel graphics! Would you like to hear some epic music? --- The game has a couple of great 8-bit tunes! The developer was so lazy that he made every level the same! But not everything is as simple as it seems at first glance: Each level is a new puzzle! You have to use 100% of your brain and 200% of your logic! Every function of the game can help you complete the level! The game has 3 colorful locations! Try not to break your brain in this plotless( ??? ) adventure!",
