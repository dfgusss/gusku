    "About the game": "TimeTekker is a pure arcade shoot em' up where your actions control the speed of time! Utilize bullet deflection, ninja stars, and slow motion powers to outlast an infinite onslaught of bug creatures! Xbox controllers are supported during gameplay! This game is also completely free to own! Compete online against the world in a constant free for all score-fest! Earn divisional rankings for your progress against other players. Rank up your ninja from Styrofoam tier to Silver, Gold, and beyond, beating down the opposition with your superior scoring skills! Show off your mastery with newly added Steam Achievements! Multiple difficulty modes, ranging from balanced to absolutely impossible! From people new to shoot em' ups to the most hardcore veterans of the genre, TimeTekker has something for everybody. This game started as a prototype in Quinnipiac University's GDD Program, but after a year of development, it's become more than I ever imagined. I hope you enjoy this little homage to all the shoot em' up games that I grew up with. Happy scoring! - Ryan O'Hara, Artii Games LLC",
