The fast paced action of Tractorball will leave you breathless with endless game changing play variations and test your reactions to the limit, fusing vehicular ball games with a VR cockpit experience. Use shooting skills with the flipper, develop your teamwork and get creative with any of the numerous dirty tricks to sabotage your opponents' play or find a cheap shot on goal. Designed exclusively for VR from the cockpit out, the game will find new ways of challenging your eye-hand coordination and spatial orientation skills. Tractorball is a physics based sports-action game and features four course layouts in five game worlds for a total of twenty levels, offering co-op and 2v2 multiplayer as well as unlockable single player leagues and tournaments.
