    "About the game": "The video poker experience you know and love from gas stations all across Nevada, now available in 3D for your PC! No gambling of real world currency is done in this game. This is just for fun and practice. Earn Diamonds with a winning hand that includes an Ace card or when in a hot-streak by winning consecutively! Spend Diamonds to unlock over 20 companion Toons, as well as skins for them and the cards! Lose too many times in a row, to enter into a cold-streak :( Don't know how to play video poker? That's OK! Playing Vidya Poker is simple: Five cards are dealt . Hold the cards that you want to keep. Draw new, replacement cards. The score of the hand is then finalized and paid out with rewards! There are many ways to earn a winning hand, and all are listed in the Payout Table in the bottom left side of the game window. Four different Poker Types are available to choose that modify the payout multipliers of winning hands. Winning hands are listed inside the game and in the Guide posted in the Community Hub section for Vidya Poker! Also, you could search for 'vidya poker rules' in a search engine! Visual options for streamers and creators! If you wanted to overlay the Vidya Poker gameplay over your other content, there are options to do that on-the-fly. Vidya Poker is solo developed by me, coolnames! This has been a passion project of mine for over a year, eating up all of my free-time outside of my day-job. Years ago, I spent many fun nights at casinos and bars, hanging out with friends, playing video poker. The gameplay is so simple and fast, I wanted to create Vidya Poker as a game that I could play while listening to a podcast or watching a Twitch stream. I really like playing it, and hope you do too!",
