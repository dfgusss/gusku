    "About the game": "Vivian has cursed herself by binding her soul to the powerful artifact, the Dark Tome. The tome haunts her in the form of a shadow version of herself, attempting to consume her and take control of her. After her defeat by Katrina, her Shadow has become more powerful and is preparing to consume her soul. Vivian ventures to the Realm of Arcana, where she first acquired the Dark Tome to confront her Shadow and lift the curse of the Dark Tome. Features: -Lost health can never be recovered unless you complete a level, making every level tense. -Acquire fragments of artifacts that increase your power. -You only keep artifact fragments upon completing a level, dying after finding them causes you to lose them. -Vivian's Kurse is easy to pickup and play, but very hard to beat and master. -You need to carefully position yourself, attack, maneuver around enemies, and platform. -Attacks are slow, enemies can move quickly, and health is scarce. -2D Platformer -Action RPG -Challenging platforming If you enjoyed this game, consider buying the prequel, Katrina's Kurse, or any of my other games :) / / /",
