    "About the game": "A man you do not know where you woke asked you to find his ex-partner who betrayed him and to get back the ancient coins they would use together. He said that if you do this he will give you your freedom. Only you can decide who you need to trust, but whatever you have to do, you have to do whatever you want to be free. 5 different missions are waiting for you. You have to find the portals to go to these missions and don't overlook the clues that will help you. Superhuman Powers You gain 3 different powers with the buttons in the game and it is easier to reach the portals with the powers. When you get the Power of Speed, you will be much faster than a normal person. When you get your Jumping Power, the effect of gravity will decrease on you and you will be able to jump higher than normal. And at the last button, it makes your size much smaller than normal and allows you to enter places that a normal person cannot. Remember! Each of these powers can help you in just one mission. Unique Universes It is your first task to collect ancient coins in these universes to return home. And in order to fulfill this task, you have to unravel the secrets of each universe you go through portals and get the ancient coin, the reward at the end. But not always your powers can help you as much as you expect. Sometimes you and your sense of direction will be left alone in a maze. Sometimes you will feel much smaller than you are. Reaching your destination will sometimes have to overcome trapped roads and climb like a mountaineer. But don't let these scare you because a salvation awaits you at the end and I know you will do your best to get there",
