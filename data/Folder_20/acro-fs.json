    "About the game": "By Aviators, For Gamers Acro FS is a stick-and-rudder aerobatic flight simulator created by Jim Bourke, airshow pilot and member of the US Unlimited Aerobatic Team. Designed from the ground up to accurately simulate aerobatic flight, it allows you to experience what it’s like to strap into a high-performance stunt plane and take to the sky. Take control of an aerobatic airplane, throttle up, and discover what you can do. There’s no navigation, no radios - just a lot of horsepower in a state-of-the-art aircraft. Exciting Features High Speed Racing: Challenging Entertainment Virtual Reality Immersion: Oculus, SteamVR, or Windows Mixed Reality  Expansive World Design: Hundreds of Thousands of Square Miles to Explore Environmental Controls: Wind, Precipitation, Daylight At Your Command Stunning Visual Detail: Powered by Unigine2 Impressive Physics: Accurate, Predictive, Component Based Simulation Multi-controller Support: Use Your Multi-USB Cockpit System Controller Required! Acro FS requires a controller to fly. For good control, you'll need a 4-axis controller. A gamepad will work, as will '3D' flight sticks that include pitch, roll, yaw, and throttle. For best results, you can also use an RC-style controller that places these controls on two sticks, or muliti-USB systems with stick, throttle, and rudder pedals.",
