    "About the game": "Basingstoke is a tense roguelike that mixes stealth and arcade action . Explore the smouldering ruins of apocalyptic Basingstoke, UK, a world of extreme peril where reanimated undead and ferocious alien monsters roam! Scavenge and Craft Loot and craft as you explore. Lob a tasty sausage roll as a diversion, or poison a kebab for bait. Sneak up and knock a monster out with a whack from a cricket bat, or slice them up with a chainsaw. Tranquillize them with a dart fired from a homemade blowpipe, or set them alight with a DIY flamethrower. There's over a hundred useable items to loot or craft! No Second Chances Use stealth to sneak , weapons to attack , or if all else fails, run! But be very careful - one bite and you'll be ripped apart to become a tasty snack for monsters!
