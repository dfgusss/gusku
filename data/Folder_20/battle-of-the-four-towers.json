    "About the game": "Four Towers have long been at war. For centuries the leaders of the towers were unable to conclude their petty fighting. No matter how often they were attacked, a strong defence always matched it. Until history erased it. Events were rewritten and scrapped from books as people turned their battle into a ‘sport’. The rich would gamble their money as the poor only hoped to win the grand prize. Teams would enter and leave as enemies. Alliances between Towers were formed, only for friendships to end. The power of money convinced anyone. Gameplay Battle of the Four Towers is an online 1v1v1v1 game best played with friends. Take command of a tower as you battle 3 others in a game of strategy and wits. Each round, pick up to 3 actions, either attack another tower or defend from another tower. If you manage to attack a tower, then they lose 3 Life Points (LP), but if they defend they lose nothing. Each action takes 1 LP, so plan accordingly. Battle of the Four Towers is in early access. Over the next few months, this game will feature many updates to add to its few features. At the moment, this game has the bare minimum. It is best to play games with your friends, but there are plans to continue development to add more features and fix bugs.",
