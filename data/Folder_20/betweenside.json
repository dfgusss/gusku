    "About the game": "A piece of interactive fiction that you rewrite as you play. The patriarch of a once-respected house is dead, survived only by his late sister's children. Bequeathed to them are his worldly and unworldly belongings, along with the fate of their family. Set entirely within the uncle's private chambers, you are tasked as the family lawyer to see the correct items go to their intended place. Each object tells a story, of the uncle or of his family, and the room has intentions of its own... Betweenside is a Gothic fiction game set in interwar Cornwall. Explore the private abode of a secretive aristocrat, where each object narrates the mystery of his family's demise through written interactive fiction. Rewrite the past and change the future, while trying to survive the present. A failing lighter is all that stands between you and the dark. Programme: A short, unnerving tale of power and legacy. Explore a Gothic chamber and learn its history. Rewrite the story and see those changes alter your surroundings. Wander a small but detailed space where nearly every object tells a story. Pierce the dark with your fickle lighter. Inspired by Gothic fiction, especially the works of Charlotte Perkins Gilman and H. G. Wells.",
