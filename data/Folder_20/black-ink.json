    "About the game": "Black Ink is a new, non-realistic GPU based painting application that, instead of imitating traditional tools, brings new inspirations to every artist. Forget about pen and paper or watercolor and discover a new, generative and truly computer based way to create. Black Ink’s non realistic tools makes creating original pictures fast and easy, whether you’re an experimented artist or never used a painting program before. Black Ink gives you the freedom to modify your brushes in any way you want and no real life constraint is going to stop your imagination. You can create the perfect brush, or the most crazy one, and share it with other users for unlimited variations and effects. Black Ink’s unique and simple node-based system allows to very easily assign behaviors to your brush as well as create limitless advanced setups. And thanks to Black Ink’s GPU technology you can forget about the pixels and work on high definition documents. Don’t worry about the resolution anymore and just create a 4, 8 or even 10k picture and draw without slowing down on real, full bitmap documents.

Black Ink is still in beta. Purchase now with a huge discount, and receive all future updates for free! A lot of great features are in development for Black Ink and the special beta offer will evolve as they come in. Take advantage of this offer before Black Ink is complete! Why Beta? 'In order to achieve this we chose to put Black Ink in the hands of the users as soon as possible to gather feedback, adapt our development to their needs and also help us finance the project while staying independent.' Approximately how long will this game be in Beta? 'Black Ink will stay in Beta as long as we feel something too important is missing. This is an iterative development and no fixed date is set but we hope we can call it complete within the next three years.' How is the full version planned to differ from the Beta version? 'Every feature in the full version will appear during the Beta process as we develop them. We are planning on adding more options to brush creation and even a way to mix them together, more drawing tools like symmetry and cloning, better management of layer number, and other improvements asked by the community. We also aim at releasing on OSX. You can see a detailed list of planned developments here ' What is the current state of the Beta version? 'Black Ink is fully functional and each update is tested and stable. The ongoing development is all about adding features. A lot of people are already enjoying drawing with Black Ink ( here ) and are giving us feedback on what to add next to make it better.' Will Black Ink be priced differently during and after the Beta? 'Black Ink’s price will raise as it becomes more complete and attain a full version value once it leaves beta version. We will announce major price-changing updates in advance so everyone can get a chance to get it cheaper.' How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? We closely monitor our community activity for feedback, bug reports, feature suggestions and of course drawings! That’s how we keep Black Ink stable and usable. Each feature development is evaluated according to what our users are asking and we are of course happy to publish the best drawings on our network. We also have an ‘Alpha’ program that users can sign up to. This version is a work in progress of the next release, it contains the features we are working on and testers can help us make them as complete as possible and stabilize the release.",
