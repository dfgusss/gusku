    "About the game": "Imagine being stranded on an island in the early 1900's, being a only survivor in a experimental plane crash. However, the island you crashed on is not a normal island, its Boom Island! Engage yourself in this arcade style first person shooter, where the main objective is to shoot highly explosive bouncing beach balls while staying alive. Immerse yourself with vintage effects and arcade style gameplay. Gamemodes: Survival: A classic style of play where your objective is to survive an infinite amount of beach balls in various waves, as you survive the waves, your difficulty will gradually increase until you get blown up. Economy In economy mode, you will survive the balls while collecting money by killing them. You can use that money to buy various weapons, ammo, and health in the in-game shop. Protection: Similar aspect to survival, however your arsenal and mobility has greatly changed. Get strapped in to a giant mounted machine gun on your destroyed plane, as you flawlessly penetrate the explosive beach balls with ammunition, not being a problem. More features: Partial Controller Support. Boom island allows you to use a controller to play. However you need to navigate through the menus with a mouse, as well as manually configure the controller binding in the control settings. Graphics Customization You can adjust a ton of video settings such as v-sync, textures, Anti Aliasing and many more. Custom Controls Change keys and their mappings to your own liking in the settings. What are you waiting for? Go head to the island and good luck.",
