    "About the game": "Bronco County is on the brink of war. A conspiracy to provoke a conflict between the western settlers and the Chepakwik threatens to destroy both sides. Only Kid, Doc, Moon and Rosy know the truth. But to save their homes, they’ll have to hunt down five legendary outlaws whose very names strike fear into the hearts of men. Boot Hill Bounties continues the saga of Kid and his companions as they journey deeper into the darkest corners of the Wild West and come face to face with the evil Creed Little, Stampede Sally, Tuco Delgado, Scorpion Saint and Burning Crow. While Boot Hill Bounties is the second game in a saga, it was designed for new players to comfortably jump in without having played the first game. Six years in development , Boot Hill Bounties is a 2D retro RPG set in the Wild West that supports single player or UP TO FOUR PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP. Wild West Epic: Boot Hill Bounties is the second episode in a game series that fuses elements of spaghetti western film - gunslinging outlaws, brave lawmen, and the untamed wilderness - with classic RPG storyline and gameplay. 90s console RPGs like Final Fantasy, Earthbound and Chrono Trigger created lasting memories and impacted us as gamers. Now, Boot Hill Bounties brings back those experiences while revitalizing the genre with a Wild West spin and innovative new gameplay elements. Retro Fresh: It's an experimental combination of old and new ideas intended to bring a new and unique experience to modern gamers and old-school fans alike. It's an epic Wild West adventure packed with excitement, intrigue, terror and the occasional dose of humor. Active Combat: Typical turn-based combat is replaced with fast and frenetic real-time system where all players remain engaged in battle and no one is waiting for a turn! 4 Player Co-op: Play single player or up to four player local co-op. Friends can seamlessly drop-in and take control of a character! You simply assign each of the four characters to various input devices. So a single player can control all four characters, or you can play with friends and divide the four characters among your friends. Music: Full soundtrack by Jake ‘virt’ Kaufman (“Shovel Knight”, “Shantae”, “DuckTales Remastered”)! Encounters: No random battles! See them on the map before engaging! Defeated enemies remember you and flee. Pixel Art: Charming, detailed sprites with hundreds of unique NPCs! Wild West Setting: Sprawling towns and locales to explore, including forests, caves, deserts and a traveling circus! 250 Enemies: Fight outlaws and animals! Can you stop a barroom brawl? Can you defeat a gang of raccoons hoarding precious garbage? Job Hats: 34 Different Job Hats - from the casual Stetson to the mysterious Careta - that teach nearly 200 battle abilities Customize Weapons: Customize your weaponry with status inflicting effects! Create a gun that fires multiple times, or a lasso that sets enemies on fire! 20-30 Hours of RPG goodness packed with content. You will almost never fight the same battle twice. Farming: Start your own farm to obtain livestock and grow crops which you can harvest for ingredients. Newspaper: Read the newspaper to learn what’s going on in Bronco County, find jobs, learn new recipes and solve puzzles. Steam Achievements: A whopping 52 Achievements! Can you collect every card in the deck? Character Profiles: Hand-drawn profiles for 20 major characters, and 34 for each of the hats. Side Quests: New side quests pop up each chapter that you can read about and track in the newspaper.

Questions Boxes: Solve riddles found in the newspaper to unlock secret combination lockboxes Import Data: Import your save data from Boot Hill Heroes and start on your last levels with all your equipment and skills. Camping: under the stars and chat with your party next to the fire or participate in several game systems. Chuckwagon Chief: Compete in a cooking competition by cooking the best food for judges using a themed ingredient. Treasure: Find and discover different treasures dropped by enemies rather than money, that you can then sell for money. Battle Grades: Earn higher grades for better combat performance for more XP.
