    "About the game": "Chaos Domain is a game about shooting bad people in the face. Apart from that, it is also a run and gun platformer, powered by Unreal Engine. The game is highly influenced by games from 8-bit and 16-bit era, including Contra/Probotector series, as well as titles like Abuse and Doom Troopers. The game is set on a huge spaceship occupied by chaos cultists, where the main character (who clearly looks like a hi-tech version of the god Anubis) must kill everyone in sight. The game is obviously not story-driven, it’s all about action. Players can upgrade weapons and purchase special items that can boost their performance. Local co-op for 2 players is available. FEATURES • Classic gameplay. • 10 levels split into sub-areas, which gives us about 30 stages. • Upgradable weapons and a range of special abilities to choose from. • Pure hardcore run and gun action. • Traditional 2 Player local co-op.",
