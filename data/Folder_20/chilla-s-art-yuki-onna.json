    "About the game": "Yuki Onna | 雪女 is a PS1 inspired survival horror game. From the creators of / Jin is your son and the locals panicked when they heard that he went missing along with 2 elementary school girls. While the police were holding a heavy search around town, you receive 3 photos of the missing kids with some writing behind, 'Come alone or I'll freeze them to death.' Out of desperation, you decide to embark on a daunting rescue mission to an abandoned inn up the piercing cold mountains. Yuki Onna | 雪女 is a similar game to Aka Manto, not a psychological horror/walksim. The game is around 90 ~ 120 minutes long depending on your skill and playstyle. Warning: This game is very challenging. You are only granted one life and death would mean a start over. If you are not confident with the ability to stay calm and persevere in the scariest of situations, you may find this game frustrating. Features: PSX/PS1 aesthetic: A nostalgic horror experience with visuals inspired by 5th generation games. Survival horror - The enemies will constantly try and hunt you while you explore. You may resort to hiding, but who knows how well that goes. Explore - Navigate through claustrophobic hallways. You may encounter interesting characters along the way. Atmosphere - Old and abandoned Japanese house setting. Puzzles - Bizarre and intricate puzzles. Perma Death - One life, no saves. Every death counts to do better on the next round. Replay value - Good ending? Bad ending? See which one you'll get. Artwork by akiko★ @ pixiv",
