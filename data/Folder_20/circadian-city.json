    "About the game": "Circadian City is a life simulation game in Early Access. The game holds a unique premise of playing both in the Realworld and the Dreamworld while they both affect each other. THE DAYLIFE You play daylife as a sim/management/adventure game where you try to make money and friends. But you can only become friends with people who share the same interests with you. Friendships you make during the day, unlock items in your Dreamworld. Take care of your basic needs (hunger, energy, motivation, happiness) Earn your life Develop your interests Make friends Maintain a healthy lifestyle Control your stress THE DREAMWORLD Dreamworld is full of crafting / building / farming. Every night, when you sleep, you find yourself in a weird place. The things you do in your daylife shape your dreams. Unlike the Realworld, you have somewhat of a playground here to take a breath. You can dream of being a farmer, rancher, miner or an ambitious gamer. Only in your dreams. Build inside your mind Craft dreamlike items Discover mysterious characters Find random encounters Make decisions about your personality upgrades Find your life goal What about your love life? Well, it’s complicated. THE EARLY ACCESS AND THE DEVELOPMENT Join the Crowd! We intend to keep Circadian City a long time in Early Access and we have crazy ideas for the game. But we know that you have even more crazy ideas and we want you to bring them in. We believe we created a fun playground and the architecture of the game is very scalable, therefore it allows tons of new content and features. We are together in this adventure. Welcome aboard! Let's make this the game of your dreams. If you want to mod, you can tailor the game to your needs (no violence in any form) and we will support you. If you want us to add a new feature, let's talk about it and see if it fits. If you want to wait for a game that's finished and polished that's understandable. But we will miss your ideas and feedback if you wait. The game needs your guidance now! A LITTLE WARNING Currently the game does not support mouse control. You can only play the game with a keyboard or a gamepad. This creates a little discomfort for keyboard+mouse players and we are working on this feature. If this is a must have feature for you, you can wait a bit more to purchase the game. Thank you for your understanding.",
