I've use ClipChap at my daily work for years, and I don't want to live without it anymore. Due to the heavy useage, this product is pretty mature. Furthermore ClipChap can: share clipboard objects with others in your LAN. export any object, converting to various file formats. copy window rectangles as images. pick a colour and copy the RGB value as a text to the clipboard. view and edit stored items, even with external programs. send items as email attachments with one click. take care of your downloads and leaves you enough bandwidth to continue. safe you valuable time. ClipChap is as useful as a mouse device.",
