    "About the game": "Cotropitorii is a third-person multi-player action shooter game that celebrates Romanian communism. Up to 32 players can join and pick between two factions and battle it out in death-match mode with over ten different weapon. The game features a communist-inspired theme backed up by period communist Romanian music, allowing you to envision yourself in the shoes of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. The game is relatively unfinished. It currently features a single map. The Backstory The story starts in 1988. During Ceausescu's reign Romania had been brimming with apathy and fear. To give hope to his people, as well as follow through with his own diabolical plan, Ceausescu started building up his army. In 1989 a war broke out. Not between Romania and its neighbors, but between Romania and the United States of America. Fueled by the hate Romanians have toward Americans, gained during the Second World War when the Americans failed to protect Romania from Stalin, millions of them enlisted in the military. Today, the war rages on as more and more of US territory is trampled by Romanian tanks. In the winter of 2024 the Romanian air force reduced the United States Air Force to less than 10% of its former power, leaving the remaining US Army only with tank and infantry support. In the summer of 2025 one million troops and two hundred thousand tanks were ready to take the battle even further as Ceausescu's plan to overtake Texas was en-route. You are part of an elite few, the Romanian Mountain Hunters, the highly-trained special forces of Ceausescu's army. You are here to hunt down and destroy Americans, wherever they may be. Your immediate task is to infiltrate enemy territory and deal a swift blow to the American infantry. This has turned into guerilla warfare, as the streets of once proud American cities are now ruins under Romanian gunfire. Details The game will run on a Pentium III or AMD 1 GHz machine with Windows 2000/Me/XP on it. It will require 256MB RAM and a 64 MB DirectX 9 compatible video card. Yes, it does require DirectX 9.0c. We recommend a Pentium IV with 2,53 Ghz machine and 1 GB RAM and a 128 MB video card for the best performance.",
