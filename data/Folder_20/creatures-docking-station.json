    "About the game": "Set the Norns free! Hatch your very own virtual life forms in this incredible addition to the hit Creatures series. Norns are endearing little creatures who grow, learn and behave just like real living animals. Norns think and act for themselves and display real feelings such as hunger, pain, fear and boredom. They can even talk to you and to each other! Based on real biological principles, these furry little pets have their own biochemistry and Creatures digital DNA and represent one of the most advanced virtual life sims commercially available today. Creatures Docking Station is a fully self-contained world with four large rooms and contains all you need to raise and train families of Norns. There are food sources, toys and loads of plants and animals in a working eco-system. Disclaimer : The online features of Creatures Docking Station are no longer available. Hatch any number of Norns from 7 different breeds at any time. Each creature is completely unique with its own personality. The Norns in Creatures titles have digital DNA, so they can inherit characteristics from their digital ancestors and pass them on to their offspring. Expand your game with a huge number of fan-created additions such as new rooms, toys or breeds! Interact with your Norns and the ecosystem in a variety of ways and observe emergent behavior in action!",
