    "About the game": "THE STORY OF CRIMSON HOTEL The Crimson Hotel was built on the site of millionaire J. Blackwood's mansion in the late 1880's. While built as a luxury lodging, the hotel never truly saw a success until it's renovation in early 1920's. The hotel entered its golden years at the start of the 1930's and remained a staple of luxury accommodation until the late 1940's, when a series of accidents involving the Barker family, which ended with the death of its two children, plagued its reputation and caused the hotel to enter a steady decline and be shutdown and abandoned in 1954. While the children's deaths were deemed accidental in later years to come, it is said that Jane Barker, their mother, who had originally been named as prime suspect, never truly reconciled with the loss of her children. Despite the extensive news coverage and attention that this tragic story attracted, it is not known what happened to Mrs. Barker after her release from custody. GAMEPLAY You play as one of four teenagers on their way back from a party when you car breaks down. It's late, it's dark and while there's no one that can help you around, you are 'lucky' enough to find yourself right outside the old, abandoned Crimson Hotel. You'll have to head in and scout for a car battery, tyre and fuel to fix your car and get out. But, finally, you understand why the hotel is abandoned... ENEMIES Some say the unfortunate children &amp; their mother remain within the hotel still to this day. Not much is known about them outside of urban myth. Jane Barker's children died under mysterious circumstances. The boy drowned and the girl died from poisoning, believed to be airborne. Jane Barker's son, the drowned boy , rarely left his mother's sight. He was extremely well behaved when being watched. It wasn't until his mothers' back was turned that me met his end. Jane Barker's daughter, the mirror girl died mysteriously from what was later discovered to be a poisoning. It is said that guests at the time heard her crying in despair as she tried to escape. It is said that she can be heard banging on the walls and mirrors throughout the hotel, and that anyone unfortunate enough to be present will meet the same end. Jane Barker herself is said to wander the hotel halls looking for her lost children. FEATURES Single Player - more difficult, and more terrifying!
