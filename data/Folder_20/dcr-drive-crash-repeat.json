    "About the game": "What is the game? DCR: Drive.Crash.Repeat is a retro style, ludicrous auto-forward driving game with an amazing twist, and absolutely no brakes! Drive your way through tens of handcrafted levels (to the extent that each level has its own name), across different atmospheric worlds! What genre is it? This game is a fusion of classical puzzle and platformer elements with drifting/driving mechanics, an original concept not done before! Game is crazy addictive and fun! Why is it fun? Because it looks easy, but it is so hard! Trying to beat a level over and over again will eventually get you there however! The game has an 'Oh, I've figured it out!' moment almost at every curve in every level! Then what seemed so hard before becomes easy! And that's where the fun is! Each level has a twist; your ultimate objective is to reach the end zone, before your time ends, and without crashing while the car is involuntarily driving forward, by strategizing your every turn! Also to find the crafty hidden objects. Explore multiple alternative paths and different solutions for each level! Collect enough stars and objects to unlock bonus levels in this addictive and challenging game. D.C.R is a thrilling experience for casual, but even more so, for hardcore gamers! Beat the learning curve and become a master! Play against your ghost or our 3 star ghosts to enhance your time! Beat through the levels in sequence or skip ahead. Driving and crashing has never been this fun! An experience that will grow on you as you get to explore vivid retro style environments and mouthwatering mechanics that span over 45 levels in 3 different worlds! Features: The hardest-car-game-in-the-world! 3 atmospheric worlds, 45 hand-crafted levels and 3 impossible bonus levels 135 optional secretly hidden objects! Crazy fun! Multiple solutions per level! Simple to learn, hard to master, impossible to put down! Localization: French German Simplified Chinese Russian Italian Turkish Spanish Arabic Portuguese-Brazil So, how many car crashes did it take to compile the promo video? Luckily, there is an in-game counter to tell us exactly that! And the number is 3,722 times! Yeah, we drive.crash.repeated 3,722 times just to capture this video! So, if you think the game is easy, think again! Note: Second trailer soundtrack 8-Bit March by Twin Musicom is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license",
