    "About the game": "Real dancers have a very limited set of actions they can perform, and we don't want to build boundaries around your imagination. That's why we came up with a solution: 3D model dancers! This way we can bring to life all kind of girls, attires, moves and actions to satisfy all sorts of requests. All girls are different from each other, with their very own style and personality, even background for those of you who want to know more about a girl's past. Select the girls you want to animate on your desktop and choose whether you want them to wear physic cloth outfits ( PLEASE NOTICE: physic cloth can impact your computer performances). Hit Start to begin. Play music from any Audiosource on your computer to let the girls dance. You can move the girls around your desktop, just dragging them with your mouse. Left-click on a girl will open the control panel where you can: • Rotate the girl • Add another girl in the scene (if she’s not there already) • Regulate dancing animation speed to synchronize the girl’s movements to the rhythm of the music. This feature will affect all the girls in the scene. • Toggle CUT MODE: this feature will affect all the girls in the scene. It's possible to interact with some parts of the outfits just by left-clicking on the scissor. While CUT MODE is active it's not possible to drag the girls. • Change the outfit of the selected girl • Remove the selected girl from the scene • Activate 5 seconds of breeze from below. This feature won't produce any effects if there are no physic cloths. This feature affects all the girls in the scene. • Set the girl to ground level. This feature affects all the girls in the scene.",
