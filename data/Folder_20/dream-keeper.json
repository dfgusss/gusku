    "About the game": "Dream Keeper is a survival game that combines top-down-shooters with deck building that plays in real-time. You have to build your own deck and embark to this dream world that is swarmed with 'nightmares'. Your job is to survive and to eliminate nightmares using the deck you built. Features Three Game Modes: Arena, Campaign, Endless. Choose from 66 unique game cards to optimize your deck in order to defeat waves of nightmares. Earn rewards in-game to buy and open card packs for the ultimate SURPRISE MECHANICS experience, and it's quite ethical because there are no in-game purchases. Note to potential buyers: We focused on the design of integrating deck building and top-down-shooting for this game, so designing different stages for the campaign was never really on our agenda but still will be discussed and updated in the future. So before you buy this game, please know that the layout for every stage is identical. But if you decide to give this game a try, we hope you find fun in optimizing the performance of your deck as we did.",
