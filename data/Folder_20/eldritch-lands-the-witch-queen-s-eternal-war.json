    "About the game": "Eldritch Lands: The Witch Queen's Eternal War is a dark fantasy strategy game in which you play as the titular Witch Queen in her struggle against the endless undead horde. In this bleak world where all the gods have either been killed or abandoned their people, when the dead rise due to the sudden appearance of a Necromancer known only as the Necroshroom Queen, it’s up to the Witch Queen to defend her Kingdom. As normal humans only add to the undead army when they die, the Witch Queen diverted all her resources into creating an army of fake people, known as a Homunculi, to serve as an unending fodder to hold the dead at bay. Unlock, Upgrade and Get to Know Your Units Discover up to 12 different units that you can use in battle. Each with different ups and downs in combat, you can customize your team to better fit your playstyle. Prefer slow moving but heavy hitting units? Or quick and long ranged? Build the team that best suits your needs. Each unit is also their own individual character, and the more you upgrade a unit the more conversations you unlock as well. Get to know each unit and find out their outlook on the war, their life or what it means to be just a copy of a copy of the memories of someone long dead. Farm Resources and Read Lore During battle, you can gain seeds that grow into fruits and plants that are highly concentrated in essence, the currency that all of the Witch Queen’s magic relies on. Plant those seeds and harvest them after they grow for a great boost in essence. You can also read through the lore of the world to gain more knowledge of what happened before and why the world is in such disarray, and a new entry is added with each new enemy and item you encounter throughout your playthrough.",
