Meet a charming cast of talking animals Join up with two buddies in local co-op Experience five different chapters that each switch up the gameplay drastically Enjoy tons of fun puzzle and platforming mechanics Bounce on a fat pig's stomach (Don't worry, they're fine with it) I'm a 15 year old solo developer from Sweden, and this is my passion project I've been working on for about 1.5 years. It's a very personal game, with almost every tiny detail having its own little story to tell. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed creating it :)",
