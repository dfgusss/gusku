    "About the game": "Defeat the gnu-demon and his army and save the day in this top-down bullet hell focused on slowdown and bullet time mechanics. Easy to play but hard to master, it requires great strategy if you aim for a hi-score while dodging bullets across 12 hand-drawn, steampunk aesthetic stages, set in South America at the end of the 19th century, in an alternate universe.​ Evorales is inspired by the classic games of the mid-90s but with a Danmaku twist. The first time you play it might seem like a very difficult game, but mastering the Alma and Ultra modes is the key to finishing the game and getting amazing scores. Key Features 12 levels with their respective bosses, plus a hidden level. On arcade mode you can choose different paths every time. Different types of damage. Blue bullets deals more damage to biological units and yellow bullets deals more damage to mechanical units. 4 aircraft to select, each one with its own abilities, strengths and weaknesses. Bullet time controlled by the player ( Alma and Ultra modes). Slowdown controlled by the number of bullets and enemies on screen. Different mechanics to score. Achievements. Different endings depending on player's skills and the amount of secrets discovered along the way. History Every game needs a villain and this one will be no exception. Our villain does not stand out for his wickedness or his power, but for his envy to his neighbors, reaching the point of making a pact with a gnu-demon. It will give him the secret of the Alma technology, which will transform a​ normal army into a powerful gnu-demon force able to defeat its neighbors. However, not everything is lost, since intel has managed to copy and implement this new technology, creating prototypes capables to standing up to the gnu-demon army. Will these prototypes change the course of war? Can you take command of these mighty aircrafts and control the Alma technology?",
