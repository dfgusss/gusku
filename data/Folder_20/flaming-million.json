    "About the game": "A NEW GAME FOUND IN THIS FLAMING DUMPSTER: follow L.C. through a warped gltich campus during the FRATPARADE. destroy the three (3) police surveillance monuments and rid the campus of masculine oppression. use the queer power of glitches and begin to heal this terrible curse put on us all. 40 - 60 minutes of gameplay Combining JRPG poetry, my haunted dreams of the SUNY Oswego campus and its infamous local holiday 'Bridge Street Run,' the tensions of the Covid-19 pandemic, and everything I had learned about glitch/corruption processes up to that point, the game follows a sort of glitch goddess as she uses the glitches developed by her queer community/friends to undo the curses of toxic masculinity around her campus (in the form of alt-right graffiti, overzealous police officers and their monuments, a gay bar turned into a straight bar [based on a true story], etc). *flaming/million does currently not support Steam overlay!*",
