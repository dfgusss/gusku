    "About the game": "This is the first game I have released on steam. Everything that I end up making on this game will go into my next game and hopefully I can make better and better stuff in the future :D Glitch War is a Action, Strategy, video game. It's a game where you command units as you take back your world from invading monsters. You control unique characters who each have their own special attacks. There are puzzles and boss fights that you will have to make your way though. There is an open world to explore. You can go in any direction you want, find new areas, new units, and experience each area as you progress through the game. I am an indie developer and have been working on this game for just under a year now and its really shown me my passion for creating games! It has been such a blast and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have making the game!",
