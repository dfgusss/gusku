    "Release date": "Sep 15, 2021",
    "About the game": "Main features of the game: 1) Deep role-playing system 2) Turn-based tactical battles 3) Lots of quests and events 4) Technology research 5) Construction of buildings in the capital and on hexagons 6) Items craft 7) an Interesting world, open to exploration and full of exciting adventures The second part is the rightful heir of the first. It saves all the key mechanics from the first part and adds a lot of new ones. The combat system is no longer an extension of the classic Disciples. Now it is a completely independent and original game The game features a huge number of races, from the classic humans, elves and orcs, to much more rarely seen in games, such as lizardmen and ratmen. Characters are formed from 2 components - race and class, similar to my favorite D&amp;D system. This game has 25 character classes to choose from and 37 classes for neutral creatures. Each class has its own set of abilities, which significantly affects the gameplay In addition to the adventure mode, the game has a strategy mode. In it you can build buildings and research technologies",
