    "About the game": "Puzzle meets Tower Defense! Load your guns! Rain death from above! Protect your valuable orphans! Defeat giant, improbable bosses! Gunhouse is part puzzle, part active tower defense, as you make big combos to launch a hail of bullets and special attacks at the alien invaders who would like nothing better than to consume your delicious orphan friends. With infinite levels (you can play this for ever ), upgradeable weapons, hardcore mode, a unique visual style from artist Juan Ramirez, a 'weird fiction' story by Brandon Sheffield (Street Fighter 30th), code by Jim Crawford (Frog Fractions), and music by Disasterpeace (Hyper Light Drifter), Gunhouse from Necrosoft Games will entertain the heck right out of you, maybe! Tower Defense! Weapon upgrades! Infinite levels! Strange narrative! Weird bosses!",
