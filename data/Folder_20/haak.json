Take them down, solve the mysteries, and embrace the world's ultimate secret! Apocalyptic wasteland In terms of art style, HAAK uses old-school graphics and dark tones to present a desolate scene of ruins, which is in line with its background of the apocalyptic wasteland, aiming to bring players into the future of the eschatological world to experience that sense of desolation. Responsive controls We'd never design a game that would give you finger cramps! Nimble movement and careful timing is the only kind of rhythm we're interested in. Unique Weapons and Skills The main weapon in HAAK is the multifunction Energy Hook that can be used for attacking and interacting with the environment, which combines with character-specific hacking skills to create all kinds of gameplay possibilities for a totally unique gaming experience. Hyper-immersive Environments HAAK's unique visual aesthetic and ambient lighting, SFX, and soundtrack work together to create hyper-immersive environments, from somber rainscapes to futuristic cities and creepy underground installations that will transport you into another world.
