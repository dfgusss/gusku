    "About the game": "Hard Light Vector is a 3D first-person action platformer where you traverse an alien environment and fight to protect the memories of the dead from corruption. You play as Adelaide and use your Hard Light dagger to jump, stab and vault your way through an alien planet-scape. As you progress through the level, you will discover upgrades that allow you to enhance your mobility. Thrusters allow you to briefly hover. Use your dagger to grind along rails, gain momentum and reach parts of the level you couldn't otherwise. But your dagger isn't just for movement. It is a Dagger after all. Stab the enemies with your dagger or throw their projectiles back at them using the dagger.",
