    "About the game": "If you are a writer and you have a good story and don't want to sell the copyright cheaply, but you don't know how to express the story in the form of video, this game may help you. The game can be seen as a music game, but it doesn't require you to hit the keyboard at the right rhythm. You only need to edit the action and special effects to show in advance, and then preview it. It will show itself at the rhythm you specify. Please wear headphones when playing. The game has built-in video tutorials, which are not only tutorials to teach players how to play the game, but also a small story, full of suspense, laughter and pain. There are two points I want to explain in the video tutorials, The first one is: during the videos recording days, my wife and I had a big quarrel. I was not in a good mood at that time, but now we have made up. The second is: the game's original price is $5 (June-10-2020---July-10-2020) . I plan to lower the price. So In the future the dollar zone price will not be 5 dollars. So the reality may be inconsistent with some contents in the videos, but I don't want to change it after it has been recorded. And I have no plan to update this game either. If the game is not hot, then everything will be good. If the game becomes hot, there will be a lot of troubles. It is better to say something first.",
