    "About the game": "'WELCOME TO IMPOSSIBALL!' IMPOSSIBALL is a re-imagining of Atari’s 'Pong' with three different game modes that can be played in singles (1-2 players) or doubles (1-4 players). The game modes are: IMPOSSIBALL, DODGEBALL and LONEBALL. IMPOSSIBALL IMPOSSIBALL is like Pong but with 500 balls instead of one. There are 10 different Power-Ups to collect (or avoid): Bigger - Increases your ship's size Fast Balls - Increases the speed of all balls Impossiball - Randomises the direction of the balls Inversion - Reverse's your opponent's controls Invisiball - All balls are invisible Magnet - Balls are attracted to your ship Shield - Your goal is protected Slow Down - Reduces your opponent's speed Smaller - Reduces the size of your opponent's ship Stop - Pauses the movement of all balls (All power-ups are temporary except for Fast Balls.) DODGEBALL DODGEBALL requires you to avoid getting hit by the orange balls as they get bigger and faster. The affect of some Power-Ups is slightly different in this game-mode, for example: BIGGER makes your opponent's ship bigger while SMALLER makes your ship smaller! LONEBALL LONEBALL is our love-letter to Atari's original game featuring one, lone ball drenched in a neon glow and all set to a chip-tune soundtrack! All game-modes can be played in single player, or with 2 to 4 players as co-op or versus - using any combination of mouse, keyboard and up to four controllers.",
