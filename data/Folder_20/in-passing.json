    "About the game": "'We need to talk...' Those words shattered everything, ruined everything. Alone with your darkest thoughts, you find yourself in a waking nightmare. The world is broken, fragmented, and your memories inescapable horrors. Sinister whispers bombard you, the world nearly impossible to navigate, and creatures move in the shadows. As a voice you thought long buried goads you, a simple light shines. A glimmer. Hope. In Passing is a first-person 3D platformer set within the confines of a broken mind. Undertake a harrowing journey of recovery, tackling the relentless throws of toxic thought as you make your way back through fragmented memories. Jump, dash, and race through a mind intent on destroying you, pushing against the insidiousness of depression. Duck out of the way of turrets, vault over chasms, run along walls, and re-assemble the shattered pillar of self at the center of the maelstrom of melancholy swirling around you. Featuring striking visuals, a gripping tale of a broken mind, challenging platforming, and a beautiful soundtrack from Lucas King, In Passing challenges players mechanically and mentally. With care and poise, even the most broken mind can be healed.",
