    "About the game": "Become immersed and learn through trial and error. Follow instructions in your target language to unlock weapons and equipment upgrades. Use your new language skills to save the city from an army of evil robots! This is *not* a classroom. There are no quizzes or word matching exercises here. The combat aspect of this game is designed to provide a genuine challenge for FPS enthusiasts while also introducing you to basic vocabulary in your chosen target language. You'll have to use everything you learn to give yourself the best chance of survival. Rocket Boy Games is a small two person indie studio based in Canberra, Australia. Our goal is to create fun alternatives to your language learning experience. Please understand that this game is currently a very basic indie quality FPS, but with your support we'd love to expand on it in the future. By adding more languages, new game modes along with graphical improvements. Current languages available to learn: Spanish (Latin American and European) French German Japanese (Kana, Kanji and Romaji) Russian Ukrainian Portuguese Italian Korean Chinese Mandarin (Simplified) Pinyin (Mandarin) Polish Swedish English (US, UK and Australian) With more to come! FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 'Is this game appropriate for beginners?' Yes! Not only is it a fun entry point for new language learners, it will also provide a challenge for intermediate learners who want to improve the speed and accuracy of their comprehension. But be prepared for a challenge. Being immersed in a new language can be very overwhelming at first, but its also the fastest and most effective way to learn. 'Will playing this game make me fluent?' Definitely *not* by itself. A well rounded approach to language learning requires exposure to a variety of resources. You should read books, watch movies, use language apps, attempt conversations, and yes.. play games! 'I'm an advanced learner. Should I buy this game?' Well, we certainly think so! In truth, you wont get as much out of it as a beginner/intermediate. But with your support we could add more levels of difficulty to the game as well as create more games in the future for a range of experience levels. 'How many hours of gameplay are there?' It's very difficult to say as everybody learns at a difference pace. If you are a beginner we predict you'll need about 10 hours of in-game experience before you are able to complete it. Linguist FPS is a roguelike style game and it is expected that you will die a lot (especially at first). As your language skills improve, it will gradually become easier to access weapons, armor and health. Your survival time will increase with repeated attempts. In addition to a training zone, the main game takes place in one large city with several potential starting locations. The supply rooms are procedurally generated with random challenges and loot inside. So each time you respawn you'll be in a new location with different challenges and equipment to discover. Please note: The current build of the game is a bit limited in its features, but we are expecting the next major update will contain improvements such as gamepad support, key re-binding and improved optimization.",
