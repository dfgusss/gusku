Soon, the Great War broke out, dragging every kingdom and village down an endless spiral of ruin and desolation. The people prayed for salvation from the Nine Gods, whose unreachable homeland lay beyond the Great Sea, on the forbidden continent of Xulima. Eventually, the conflict came to a point where it threatened to ruin all creation. Thus Golot, Lord of Works and Dreams, appeared to Gaulen, a seasoned Explorer who lived on a remote island off the coast of Rodinia. The Lord of Works appointed Gaulen to be his Herald on Earth and to set sail for Xulima, so that balance could be restored to the world. Thus begins the adventure of our young protagonist.
