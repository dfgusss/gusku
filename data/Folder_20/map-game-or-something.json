    "About the game": "MAP GAME is a short puzzle-platformer game in which Cart - a lazily designed, boring person - and Map Guy - an adventurer who has been cursed to be trapped inside of a map - journey to find a way to free Map Guy of his curse. Along the journey, these idiots run into some green dude who would like to turn them into dead people. Help them fight back and free Map Guy so I can forget about this horrible game. Cool features in this 'game' include: Draw custom maps of levels in order to navigate through them By the way you can't see when you are moving because you have to use a map while you are moving. I know, it's dumb Solve puzzles and get through short levels to advance through each chapter Meet some green clown who wants to kill you with a few lasers Horrendous art and music all made by me Get to know the 3 characters who you are trapped with on this stupid adventure Learn to regret buying this game Play through fun challenge levels which offer unique restrictions to challenge you I guess Why am I even making this Defeat cool bosses who mostly shoot at you with lasers which you have to dodge Nobody is going to play this Play secret level which remix older chapters to make them more challenging I just want to be done with this game Discover a mysterious dude who I haven't thought of a design for I'm a failure And many more! But not really, that's about it. I just wanted that to be the punchline",
