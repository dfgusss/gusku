    "About the game": "You are a lone astronaut on a base that has been seemingly been abandoned. The Unified Field Reactor is spinning out of control and unleashing energy above the Lunar surface. The energy being unleashed has made time and space unstable and creating environmental events to occur at any moment. Fortunately your heads up display is your ally (or is it?) in a game that will give you Foresight into what is about to happen so that you can prepare. This is a mission based game with a different scenario playing out in each mission whether it be environmental (take shelter), tactical acquisition (finding equipment or ammo) and the eradication of a number of different types of hostiles. Do be careful because hostiles do not care about your assigned missions and will attack regardless . From the avoidance of meteor showers to the retrieval of much needed weapons ammunition for real world cosmonaut weaponry this will be a fight for you to survive. You will scour the landscape for real world cosmonaut weaponry to battle against the hostiles bent on destroying you. Laser pistols , Hand Pistol Shotgun , Jet Rocket Gun and Rocket Launcher are just some of the weapons that you will find discarded on the Lunar surface.",
