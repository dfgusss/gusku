Each comment, post, mail allows us to meet interesting people from all over the world. Something amazing! Further projects are being developed ... it means hard times for us but we are well organized and work on projects is moving forward every day. 3D wallpapers require standard Windows 10 settings. Most users have this but probably there are negative comments that it is a problem for some people with changed system settings. Problem with access to the menu? Read more in Community HUB. Sorry. Windows 10 requires these settings and we can't do anything about it :( BIG THANKS, 3DM",
