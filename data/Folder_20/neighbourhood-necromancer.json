    "About the game": "Command the undead to take revenge on the suburbs! Oh, everyone at school laughed at you, but no one will laugh when your minions seize control of critical local infrastructure. Perhaps you’ll start by taking over a convenience store. Neighbourhood Necromancer is a hilarious interactive horror novel where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Will you rule suburbia openly or skulk in the shadows? Will your necromancing impress the cool kids at school? Will you use your dark powers to destroy your home town, or save it from the secret industrial/military operatives who have come to destroy you? The choice is yours. Become a teenage small-town necromancer. Play as male or female, gay or straight. Manage an unruly squad of walking corpses. Exact brutal vengeance, or struggle to maintain your humanity. Entertain unexpected house guests from beyond the grave.",
