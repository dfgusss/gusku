Fantastic.' - 1UP NEStalgia is an original multiplayer RPG inspired by the glory days of traditional console RPGs. Essentially 'Dragon Warrior 3 meets World of Warcraft' , NEStalgia is an amalgam of the best generations of RPG gaming. Players wage classic turn based battles in multiplayer parties while enjoying modern trappings such as a full-featured quest system.
