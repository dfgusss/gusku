    "About the game": "When evil looms close and devastation is certain… Who will have what it takes to save the day? NO HEROES HERE is a hectic co-op game for one to four players. Coordination and cooperation are your key weapons to success - everyone must play a role in the battles to come and work together as a team in order to protect the castles and Kingdom from imminent doom. Forces beyond your understanding have struck with terror and chaos. The King's broken army and fallen heroes cannot protect you from harm. It is up to you to protect the realm from evil and restore Noobland to glory! Noobland was once the largest and mightiest Kingdom in the world - but it's days of glory were cut short by an onslaught of evil and mysterious forces, which brought forth misfortune and calamity. Desperate, the King gathered all heroes in his realm to reclaim his lost lands. In every battle, he bore his three lucky charms: a medallion, a teddy bear and his crown. The King was triumphant - his was a peerless, undefeated army. However, the King's lucky charms were lost in the midst of battle and without them, he felt vulnerable and afraid. And rightly so - for after the loss of his items, came weakness, defeat and decimation. The King, unwilling to give up, chose to make a last stand and sent his final champion, the Last Hero of Noobland, in a mission to recover his lucky charms. Invite all of your three friends to play with you! Two? One...? None?! Then revel in our single player mode, if playing solo is your style! If not... Play with your friends either locally or online. No friends? No problem! Join an online match with other Non-Heroic figures all over the world! Normal mode not challenging enough? Hardcore mode offers the frighteningly ominous reality of a single life to live! Three different regions with each their own mechanics, enemies and quirks. Don't care for cannonballs? Maybe you'll find roasted chickens more to your liking! As you journey through the realm, recruit more Non-Heroes to your ragtag band of castle defenders. Twelve different enemy types to test your ballistic skills on! You will love No Heroes Here if you like the games: -Fall Guys -Overcooked -Among Us -Gang beast",
