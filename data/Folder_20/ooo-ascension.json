Features - A lightning-paced test of reflexes and skill across 90 levels split into 9 Sectors, each with it's own unique challenges and visual style - Local Co-op mode - race with (or against) a friend! - Leaderboards to see how you rank globally for each Sector - Stunning neon visuals and immersive electronic soundtrack - Ghosts allow you to see your fastest time for each level, or latest attempt if you haven't completed it yet",
