    "About the game": "You’ve decided to take the risk and purchase a run down house in the middle of a spooky forest near a dungeon overrun with monsters. Lucky for you you’ve been trained in the art of Potion making! Explore the land and dungeon for ingredients to create powerful potions and tasty delicacies. Unfortunately for you, you're not a fighter. Many potions have powerful effects which can aid you in battle, whether it’s to make you smaller, faster, blow up areas and monsters or a potion to summon a cute ghost to just hang out. Sell your extra potions and prepared foods to the merchant for a bit of coin. You can use this coin to purchase recipe books, and even expand the land around you. When you unlock new areas you’ll find new ingredients, crafting recipes, crops, animals, secrets and more. There are plenty of things to do in your days in Potion Paws. You can Explore the world, look for materials, craft potions or foods, tend to your garden, or take your chance dungeon diving for treasures and rare ingredients! Your adventure starts at the spooky old house you just bought, which is right by the entrance of an old mysterious dungeon. Heavy fog covers this lands but don’t worry! You can use your resources to clear the fog and uncover more land to explore and find more items to collect! With each area you unlock there are new materials, secrets, and even creatures you can find and carry home. You will want to explore as much of the map as you can and unlock all it’s treasures. This world is full of monster parts, plants and more that you can use to craft into unique goods to sell! You can cook delicious monster treats and craft powerful potions that have plenty of different effects! With your alchemist skills at hand you can use your cauldron to create a wide variety of potions. Potions can be sold or used for its effects. You can use a potion by drinking it or throwing it to alter the world around you or defeat monsters. For example, if you make a Cactus Potion and drink it, you’ll grow spikes and enemies that touch you will take damage. But if you throw the cactus potion at a group of enemies, spikes will grow out of the ground hurting them. The potions can also be used to reach new areas. See a hole that’s too small to fit through? Maybe a Tiny Potion can help.",
