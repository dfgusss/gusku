    "About the game": "Have you ever had a dream in which you had to run and can do nothing to stop it? And if it was a nightmare? 'Running Girl' presents 2 such modes: 'Dream' - an infinite run; 'Nightmare' - a run with 9 levels each is getting harder. Soon customization of the character will be added. Your main goal in the 'Dream' mode is to run as long as you can collecting flowers and presents. Your main goal in the 'Nightmare' mode is to collect candies, fight bosses, and complete all the levels. During your run, try to avoid all the obstacles by using the game controls: arrows or WASD and 'Space'. You can avoid them by moving the character up or down the lane or by jumping over some of them (not all) using 'Space' or sliding using the right arrow. If you hit any of the obstacles, your character will lose a life. But don't worry: you can restore up to 5 lives if you gather a Heart bonus (one life for each Heart). There also other power-ups in the game which allow you to become invincible, speed up or attract flowers and presents. MAIN GAME FEATURES : + Two game modes; + Bosses in the Nightmare mode; + Avoid different obstacles by jumping , sliding or running in different directions + Collect: and + Use different power-ups: get an extra life; become invincible; collect nearest flowers; speed up.",
