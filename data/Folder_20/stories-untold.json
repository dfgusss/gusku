    "About the game": "Now available on MacOS (note: dedicated graphics card is *highly recommended* for the best experience) “Stories Untold” is a narrative-driven experimental adventure game, that bends the genre into something completely unique. Combining a mix of classic text-adventure, point-and-click and more, 4 short stories are packaged together into a single mysterious anthology that has been described as “a fantastic, fascinating example of interactive visual storytelling” (Telegraph 5/5) and earning widespread critical acclaim since release. The game pulls together 80s retro nostalgia, innovative and experimental genre-defying gameplay, and tense, phycological horror to create “one of the most fascinating and unique tales you can play this year” (GameSpew 9/10). The first Episode “The House Abandon” is now available for free via a demo, to give you a glimpse of what is in store in the full game. “Stories Untold” was developed by No Code, a Glasgow based ex-AAA development team headed up by Jon McKellan (Alien: Isolation) and Omar Khan. Features: - Four unique stories, with their own settings, gameplay and mechanics. - Play mind-bending text adventures, process radio transmissions and conduct experiments on bizarre artifacts - Gorgeous retro-aesthetic brings back vivid memories, or a glimpse into what was. - Sublime synth-wave horror soundtrack, inspired by 80s horror soundtracks. - Achievements to unlock, and narrative secrets to discover - Genre-hopping: from psychological horror, to tense mystery and terrifying sci-fi; Stories Untold is truly “4 stories, 1 nightmare”.",
