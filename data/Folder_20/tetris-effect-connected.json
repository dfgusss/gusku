    "About the game": "Tetris® Effect: Connected is Tetris like you've never seen it, or heard it, or felt it before—an incredibly addictive, unique, and breathtakingly gorgeous reinvention of one of the most popular puzzle games of all time. In all of the 30+ gorgeous single-player stages and 10+ modes, and in both cooperative or competitive online and local multiplayer modes, everything in Tetris® Effect: Connected—music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves, pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing and the award-winning soundtrack, taking Tetris’s already fiendishly-addictive replayability to new heights. FEATURES Includes the all-new “Zone” mechanic, where players can stop time (and Tetriminos falling) by entering “the Zone” and either get out of a sticky situation that could otherwise lead to “Game Over,” or rack up extra Line Clears for bonus rewards. Tailored for Steam, capable of running at resolutions of 4K or more with an uncapped framerate (with Vsync disabled) and includes ultra-wide monitor support as well as other expanded game and graphical options not found in the console release for both 2D and VR play (including adjustable particle volume and size, texture filtering, and more). 'Connected' co-op mode, where up to three players can literally connect their Tetris playfields together and play as one. 10+ single-player Effect modes with varying twists on the classic Tetris formula, designed to evoke different moods the player might be in (or want to be in -- i.e. chill out with “Relax,” concentrate with “Focus,” enjoy the familiarity/nostalgia of “Classic” modes or try something unique with “Adventurous.”), as well as appeal to varying skill levels. Nostalgic stages based on old-school Tetris games, as well as Classic Score Attack multiplayer mode with the rules and appearance of 8-bit Tetris. Fully featured multiplayer, including cross-platform play with all other platforms, matchmaking for Ranked play, robust options for Friend matches, player progression for unlockable avatars, and more!",
