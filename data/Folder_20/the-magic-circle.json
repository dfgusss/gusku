    "Name": "The Magic Circle",
    "Release date": "Jul 9, 2015",
    "About the game": "You are the protagonist of an unfinished 1st person fantasy game, trapped in development hell. The designers (played by James Urbaniak , Ashly Burch , and Karen Dyer ) are god-like, but so indecisive that they've given you no powers whatsoever. With the help of a mysterious disembodied voice ( Stephen Russell ) you must seize the tools of game development from these unworthy 'gods', uncovering more of the darkly comic story as you go. Rather than traditional puzzles with a single solution, the incomplete state of each environment is a question that you answer in your own way. Trap the designers' creations, steal their behaviors, and re-mix them to explore and master this world-in-progress. Can you out-think the game gods? Can you ship The Magic Circle from inside it? Warning: Some strong language and references to adult subject matter.",
