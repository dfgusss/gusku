    "About the game": "Traffic Chase is a road racing game. Drive in traffic and ask any driver to race with you! Overtake, take off and win! Kick off a new race by honking at another driver three times. The race starts after the 3rd beep, don't cheat! :) Connect any driver to the race at any time just by honking at him. Focus on race! It can last for several minutes or go on for a long time with a lot of drivers. All depends on your free time! There are eleven cars and several stock configs for each. Some of them can be more powerful, others are better at handling. Compete with them in traffic! Race on different roads. Some roads have long straight sections and small height difference. Others have a lot of turns and bumps. One racer can have more powerful car but be not so lucky in traffic. Become the king of the road! Use your skills and patience to beat more powerful racers! Both you and AI drivers are driving physically-based cars. No fake AI behaviours, only fair competition! AI is good enough to not be boring :) You and other racers have the same chances! The more you drive, the more money you earn. You can use this money to buy a new car at dealership or tune your current one. Use trade-in to replace your car with more powerful. What is the simpliest tuning schema to be the fastest racer? Is hard suspension always good on turns? Check yourself which tuning performs better on roads! Think you are fast enough on roads? Prove it on drag strip or race track! Participation in track events will cost you some money and the prize will depend on chosen opponents skill. Be careful to not spend all you money during participation in top-skilled races. But anyway, roads are always opened and road races always allow you to restore your budget! Have an exciting road races!",
