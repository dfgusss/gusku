To navigate, you’ll have to rely on incomplete maps, unreliable commuters and even a sliver of luck. While the main objective is as simple as finding your right stop, the more you explore, the more you’ll learn about the mysterious transport hub that seems to have a mind of its own. Try to find a way out of this Tower-of-Babel-esque navigation adventure Uncover the mysteries that lie in the sprawling underground Decipher the foreign, tangled and incomplete subway maps Talk to other commuters and learn their stories in an effort to make sense of your situation Find the secrets behind the station names, hubs and incomplete maps Uncover a myriad of mysteries and carefully placed Easter eggs Find your station, or become ever more lost in Trainslation. Global Game Jam This game was originally developed in roughly 3 days for the Global Game Jam 2021 where the theme was 'Lost &amp; Found'. Later on after the Jam deadline, we spent two more weeks to polish the experience even more and release it here on Steam. The original Game Jam version is included in the game's folders.
