    "About the game": "VESTIGE A journey through memories. A story of lost love. A groundbreaking room-scale VR experience. “Our memory is a more perfect world than the universe: it gives back life to those who no longer exist.” ― Guy de Maupassant VESTIGE is a room-scale VR creative documentary that uses multi-narrative and volumetric live capture to take the viewer on a journey into the mind of Lisa as she remembers her lost love, Erik. Within an empty void, fragments of past memories appear of their life together. As we navigate the space to explore these moments, new memories are triggered revealing new pathways through the story. Over time the memories become entangled with a haunting vision and eventually lead us to the shocking moment of Erik’s death. Every viewing will reveal a different journey towards this moment, revealing the complex world of memory and grief. VESTIGE is a standing room-scale VR experience with spatial sound, headphones are recommended for complete immersion. The way you navigate the space will change the story. No controllers are required.
