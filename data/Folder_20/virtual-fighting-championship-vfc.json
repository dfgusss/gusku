    "About the game": "ATTENTION: If you are a boxing purist looking to buy Thrill of the Fight 2, this game is not for you. VFC is more brutal, more free-formed, and hopefully, less serious. With PVP at its core, VFC seeks to explore into a realm of possibility enabled by VR's unshackling of real-life restraints, and it strives to become the 'Street Fighter' in VR. We've implemented so many fighting mechanics that can't be comprehended in a simple article. Please visit www.vfcgame.com for details. If sparring while chatting with your opponent isn't your thing, VFC also has a lighthearted single-player campaign. Our AI is tactful and fights with diverse styles. Players can choose to queue into a PvP game while playing offline modes. Outside of 1v1 fighting, VFC boasts a wide range of fitness training modes that let player practice their striking, endurance, stamina, defense awareness and combat readiness; it even hosts a running competition inside the game!
