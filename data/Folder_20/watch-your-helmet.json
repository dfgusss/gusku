    "About the game": "You still could not even imagine how difficult it is to control a spacesuit with a jet engine in space. Thanks to this game, you will realize how interesting and exciting it is, especially if you need to escape from moving asteroids, dodge moving planets, collect fuel and minerals, and complete a rescue mission. Test and then improve your spatial awareness and rocket management skills in zero gravity at 45 levels full of minerals, dangerous asteroids, planets and abandoned cats in space that need rescue. Pass through five worlds with real physics, zero gravity, individual planets, exploding asteroids, whole planetary systems and gravitational anomalies. Master the features of motion in space, develop spatial awareness, dexterity, memory and speed of reaction. Fight with inertia, calculate speed, fly in any position, upside down, forward legs, at any angle convenient for you. Turn on the protective field to avoid fatal damage to the helmet and body of the spacesuit from planets and their satellites, use the magic of a gyroscope to stop the rotation of the spacesuit and fix the angle of the body. Save your fellow astronauts who are left without fuel and get extra bonuses for this. Understand how hard it was to control real brave astronauts with their jetpacks. Feel and understand the concept of relativity of movement. Get a variety of achievements and rise to first places on the leaderboards, outperforming other players due to speed, dexterity, the amount of collected minerals and saved cats.",
