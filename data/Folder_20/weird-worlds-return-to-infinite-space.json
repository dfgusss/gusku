    "About the game": "Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space is a hybrid 'roguelike' game of space exploration and starship combat set within a peculiar, as-yet-unvisited region of the galaxy known as the Purple Void. Each time it is played, a new and different 'sector prime' and its vast frontier are randomly generated. Locations of stars and nebulae, homeworlds of alien races, distribution of lifeforms and artifacts, plot-twisting quest events--the whole game is remixed. Note that unlike common roguelikes that last dozens of hours, Weird Worlds: Return to Infinite Space plays to its conclusion in less than thirty minutes - it's the perfect lunch break game! Features also include a fully animated star map, a unique turn-based movement system, real-time starship battles (at naval battle speeds, not 'Super-Melee'), award-winning music and sound, and a robust battle simulator. Weird Worlds also has built-in support for community-created mods that can change anything and everything in the game! Check out some of the best Weird Worlds mods here .
