    "About the game": "XO is a 3D space fleet 'roguelike-like' wherein we attempt to answer the question, 'what if FTL, Battlestar Galactica and Star Control had a love child?' In XO you're on the run and must amass a fleet powerful enough to save humanity -- using your wits, lasers and freshly baked cookies. How will you command in this time of chaos? By seizing cargo, weapons and ships, or through diplomacy and sacrifice? You decide who lives and who dies, because without you, there is no hope for humanity. You'll encounter ships under distress, desperate refugees, greedy merchants, pirates, wreckage and caches to loot, shipyards and stations, enemy traps... and much more in each unique procedurally generated run. Each ship you add to your fleet reduces your dwindling resources, but adds unique abilities. Warships add firepower, Farmships feed your fleet, Industryships add manufacturing and repair capabilities, and Cargoships increase your fleet's storage capacity. As your fleet grows you must also navigate treacherous political scenarios. How will you deal with infighting, sabotage, and the misunderstandings that come from cramming factions that hate one another together? Do you rule with an iron fist, try to bring opposing factions together, favor a particular faction, or carefully manipulate the factions to keep a balance? You decide. Use your resources to upgrade ships, create trade items, manufacture weapons, and make critical repairs. Resources are automatically gathered, but the ships in your fleet influence your gathering rates and capacity -- as do different planet types. Hope that you have the right ships and enough resources when the enemy finally closes in. Your exodus will take you to many worlds. You'll come across habitable worlds, gas giants, airless rocks, frozen wastelands, and hellish molten planets. Most can be tapped for the precious resources you need to survive... provided you have the right ships in your fleet. Others... well, let's hope you've prepared. Original soundtrack by Jim Guthrie",
