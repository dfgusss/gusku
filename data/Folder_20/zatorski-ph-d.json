    "About the game": "Indie-game in the genre of psychological adventure with the elements of rogue-like and visual novel. A meditative, thought-provoking simulator of an infinitely lonely old professor who’s life and existence are questionable. Confusion, terror and despair are a part of a routine here. There’ll be something worse. Much worse. Immerse yourself in the thoughts of a person who’s not sure he even has thoughts. Solve problems that do not require a solution. Evoke the memories of things which never existed and plan something that’s never gonna happen. Reflect when you don’t need to. Then look inside yourself and try not to cry. Just relax and talk to yourself, looking at the professor’s room or trying to perceive the silhouettes in the white emptiness. Listen to the music. Ask yourself questions and give answers to them. This game is not about victory or failure, fast response or precision, achievements or research. Just in some way. Basically this game is about an inner dialogue. The gameplay which will make uncomfortable both newbs and experienced gamers. The melancholic atmosphere alternates the seizures of black dispair. Classical music. Puzzle-solving session High difficulty. Meaningless life. Conscious death. There’s no save system in the game cause it’s not necessary.",
