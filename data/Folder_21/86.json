    "About the game": "Get ready to enter a mysterious land full of brain-boggling puzzles that come without instructions. Explore the world around you to help you learn and understand the rules, and take notes that will help you later in more complicated areas. But there's a catch! After 86 seconds, you will die and the world will be reset to its original form. All that remains constant are your memories. Manage your time wisely and write down your discoveries using a handy-dandy in-game notebook or, better yet, real-life paper! #YOLOAO (You Only Live Over And Over) You are Sluggle: the little green gastropod who has woken up in a world of doom. Sluggle will have to slither through the unknown and experiment with whatever can be found in order to progress and prevail. But it won't be easy! Work your way through a series of rooms and aim to learn something new every 86 seconds, be it a new area, gameplay mechanic, or something else! The fast-paced puzzle game your brain never asked for! Contains three different types of puzzles, and countless ways in which they work: Explore to find various puzzles, some more complex than others Start by solving simple puzzles to learn new rules Combine your gained knowledge to solve the more difficult puzzles, unlocking new areas that will teach you more rules Despite the time limit feature, you are rewarded for exploring. If you try to rush through the game, you'll be facing a series of frustrating trial-and-error puzzles. If you use each 86 seconds wisely and navigate your way around the whole map before attempting your winning run, you will be introduced to a series of weird and wonderful brainteasers that challenge you to think both logically and creatively. But that's not all... While the main objective of 86 will give you a run for your money, your adventure doesn't stop there. There's plenty more to do in the world, and you'll want to play multiple times to find everything! As you familiarise yourself with the game's mysterious rule system, it'll be easier for you to cover more ground quickly within the time limit, and if you're lucky you'll even- -wait, never mind, I'm not supposed to tell you about that part. Awkward.",
