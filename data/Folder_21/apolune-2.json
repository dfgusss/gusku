    "About the game": "Apolune 2 is a stand-alone adventure single player and local co-op game set in the asteroid belt. You and your team of astronauts are asteroid miners on a mission to make spacebucks, survive and thrive in deep space. Fill the local high scores to challenge your friends and family to a fantastic experience. Use STEAM Remote Play to play the game with your friends online. Collect resources, buy upgrades and fight aliens and space pirates! Apolune 2, sequel to Apolune: the Endless Bullethell Shooter, arrives with splash on STEAM. Apolune 2 is a controller-friendly game that is super easy to pick up and play. Simultaneous Co-op: 2 players on Keyboard Only 1 to 4 players with XBox controllers, and 1-8 players with DirectInput * see notes below Repair, mine, shoot, collect! Fight off enemies like aliens and space pirates! Trade with interstellar merchants High score name entry Fun, casual and fun to play with friends! Lo-fi instant classic! How to Multiplayer: If you don't want to use the keyboard, you will need at least one controller connected. Two players can play using just the Keyboard, or a combination of 1 or 2 controllers and the keyboard. It is also possible for one person as players 1 and 2 to use the keyboard with a 'third' controller plugged in so a second player can play. If you have XInput Controllers (XBox 360 or later, known as XInput Controllers) only up to 4 of these will be detected. That is the limit of XInput. If you mix and match with DirectInput controllers (non-XInput controllers known as DirectInput controllers, 'Gamepads', like USB retro controllers like the PS2/3/4 style or NES or SNES style, anything generic non-XBox-looking generally) you can get up to 8 people controlling individual players with controllers, or a mix of keyboard and controllers.",
