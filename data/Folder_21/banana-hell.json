Pixel perfect jumps, using the enemies in your favor, and progressively harder design, can you beat this? - Banana monologues! You are not alone in this quest, Bananaman is a very chattery person. You've got an amazing company full of bad jokes! -The higher you climb, the heavier you fall! - 5 extremely challenging levels! - Over 300 banana lines of speech! 'This is a hard game. I mean... really hard. A rage game, some would say. And it's about me, a Banana... that's also a man, at the same time I mean -- I'm sorry is this too confusing? This game doesn't make sense, I know. Ah, I've forgotten to tell you, I'm very annoying, and also don't like you - the player.' -- 2020, Bananaman Johnson about Banana Hell.",
