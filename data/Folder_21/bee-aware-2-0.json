    "About the game": "Bee Aware! , an active clicker game for ages 14 to 122! Help the bees get rid of all the bad, bad industrialists on every continent with the use of bags of biological pest control. Earn these bags by playing eight minigames. Games that will surely fit the needs of every casual gamer! As a bonus, there are three 'hidden' mini-minigames! See if you can find them! Bee Aware! Not just another Bee Game! *** PERMANENT PRICE DROP! 50% OFF! *** Features: Fun and relaxing gameplay for the casual gamer (perfect for a rainy day). Beautiful ambient music (per game) by Polish composer Jacek Dojwa and a host of other composers. There's a total of 20 different songs in the game! Beautiful images (well, some). Some fun &amp; cool sound effects. 80 achievements (11 hidden), ranging from easy to a bit more challenging. Featured Games &amp; Extra's: B ee A ware! A simple clicker game with some fun animations, as well as the main hub for the minigames. This is where you spend your earned bags of biological pest control. B ee vs M ites! This is a one level, endless (well, untill you get killed) arcade game where you have to pick up flowers and avoid varroa mites, though you can (occasionally) fight them with powerups. Billy Joe Henry Bob is hindering your progress with an axe, a super soaker, a leaf blower, a pesticide sprayer and his own bad breath. And... you will have to face the notorious Mega Mite! See if you can beat her! You can choose from three difficulty levels. B ee S mart! Five original quizzes, with twenty questions each. The subjects are Bees!, Bees Revisited!, Mother Earth, The Universe and a silly quiz about the game and the game characters. B ee R emembered! A simple and relaxing memory game, with three difficulty levels. B ee A mazed! Save the eggs, and avoid the wasps, hive beetles, varroa mites and the angry ghost, hidden in the maze of the hive. You can choose from three difficulty levels. The game is always the same on the outside, but never on the inside! B ee P uzzled! Relax a bit with soothing music and the 56 beautiful images in this jigsaw game. There are three difficulty levels to choose from. B ee't the B ear! Try to outsmart the bear and warn your hive before the furry creature gets there. Watch out for the hornet scout though! One difficulty level, three stages, and fresh boards for each new game. B ee F ast! Farmer Billy Joe Henry Bob scattered pieces of your hive (and honey!) all over his land. See if you can retrieve all pieces of honey within the given time, while the halfwit farmer tries to shoot and suffocate you, firing a shotgun, throwing explosives and steering an rc-plane loaded with pesticide. Play through three stages in this arcade game, on three difficulty levels. B ee B rave! *dark and echoing voice* Dare you enter a dark and perilous world, just to help an obsessed bee get his prized golden honey jar? Dare you enter the Warped Wasteland, the Ferocious Forest, the Vile Village and the Gruesome Grotto? Well, you should have your head examined! No one in his (or her) right mind would go there for such a futile reason! Then again, you'll miss out on a great adventure! You wouldn't want that, would you now? So, buckle up, sharpen your wits and go help this bee in this classic text adventure! B ee H elped! The help section, with detailed information on each game. Probably not necessary, since BB tells you (more or less) what you need to know when you start a game for the first time, but hey, you never know. Last, but not least... BB! See what silly bee BB (What?!? [nothing, BB...] Ow... ok) has to say. Just for the record, I'm not responsible for, nor do I endorse his silly comments (Hey, I do provide the backstory as well! [True, BB, true… but the rest is silly] Hmpf!). And... there are three 'hidden' mini-minigames, but you will have to find them yourself. The game runs in fullscreen mode, with an optional slideshow in the back. Be aware (ha ha): Bee Aware! does not run well with onboard graphics chips, however, you could try with an integrated Intel HD Iris (GT2) chip or similar/higher.",
