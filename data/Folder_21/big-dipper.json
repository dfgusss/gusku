Cast Andrew Family troubles forced Andrew to leave his childhood home and step into an an early adulthood. Cast out on his own by a cruel twist of fate, he was led far north, where he was saved from the cold by an elderly furniture maker. Andrew studied the old man’s craft, and worked hard independently for years to come. Soon enough, he was finally able to afford his own house.
