A STORY OF THE HUMAN DESCENT INTO DARKNESS From the creative minds behind the critically acclaimed Layers of Fear, experience first-hand the toll that fear can take on the mind in an original story inspired by the cinematic lore of Blair Witch. FIND THE WAY THROUGH THE HAUNTED WOODS Navigate your way through a cursed forest that warps and distorts both time and space. YES, YOU CAN PET THE DOG ​You're not going in alone: you have your trusty canine sidekick, Bullet, by your side. You can encourage him with treats, or discipline him for wandering off - but know that how you choose to treat him affects your story.
