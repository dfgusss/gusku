    "About the game": "Gamecat Update Boxed In is more than just a puzzle game. if you manage to escape the 'Puzzle Room' you can explore a magical island, visit a castle, swim with sharks and discover a jet-pack! There's even a jet-pack mini-game to uncover! Original Description You find yourself in a room with no exits. Colourful cubes move towards you from the far wall, the ceiling, or from beneath your feet. To avoid being squashed you must create matches of the same colour. When a match is made, the cubes will explode and destroy any others of the same colour touching them. They keep coming, faster and faster. How long will you survive? If you prefer a more relaxed experience then you can play in Solitaire mode. The room starts full of static cubes and you can take your time to clear them. Even the music is more relaxed in this mode! Difficulty is determined by three options: number of colours, match-type, and where the blocks come from. Once you've mastered three colours you can increase to four or five. If making matches of 3-in-a-row is too easy, then switch to a block-of-four. If you prefer to be squashed from above or below then change the direction the blocks come from. In total there are 36 variations of play. You have the ability to: change the colour of a cube, add a new cube, or push a cube when it's close to you. The game can be played with or without VR. You can run the tutorial to get familiar with each control type. The goal is to get the highest score you can before you are either crushed by the cubes (in Survival) or you clear the room (in Solitaire). If you remove cubes quickly then you earn a multiplier allowing you to increase your score rapidly. Each of the 36 game modes has a leaderboard dedicated to it. Get your name up there and challenge your friends!",
