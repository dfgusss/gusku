( accuracy - armor - batteries - food - ammo - health - jump - luck - punch - speed - spread - zoom - cash ) Combat is performed in real time action by punching, shooting, explosions from bombs or by simply pushing enemies off the bridge. The sun always rotates around the player and will destroy bridge blocks and can also be used as a weapon or disabled by purchasing the sun-stabilizer in the store. This game has rougelike permadeath, if the character dies they lose everything. Completing each level rewards you with a cash bonus that can be saved or spent in the store on upgrades.
