    "About the game": "*** developed in 15 weeks *** Cold Sun is a powerful little narrative driven third person stealth adventure where you and your little brother attempt to sneak into the last habitable oasis in a post apocalyptic world. Created by students at UQAC, Cold Sun is a third person stealth adventure that takes place in a post-apocalyptic world that’s running out of fresh water and is overflowing with garbage (just imagine the Earth in a few decades time). The majority of the world is uninhabitable now and raiders roam the lands looking to steal everything they can from anyone passing by. There is one last habitable oasis, but getting there won’t be easy as it’s well guarded – you’ll need to bribe your way past guards and sneak past raiders as you attempt to get you and your brother to safety. It takes around 30 minutes to play through Cold Sun and it really impresses with its high quality artwork, exceptional environmental detail and heartfelt narrative. The stealth mechanics are particularly well implemented – offering a nice amount of challenge, but also being forgiving enough to allow you to recover from mistakes. A beautifully crafted little stealth adventure with a lot of heart.",
