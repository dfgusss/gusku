    "About the game": "Since the BLACKHOLE NO.24 came, the colloc land lost its color. Let's defeat the BLACKHOLE NO.24 and make the fantasy world colorful again! As the color elf, every colloc has its own different energy, using its energy they can fission and merge, players can use this ability to solve puzzles and explore interesting gameplay. There are 6 entire unique chapters and 60 different challenging levels for you to explore. And there are so many fun elements that can keep your curiosity. I am a solo game developer and I founded a game studio called Pazolab Studio. I like puzzle games and cats. I will keep making games in the future. If you like my game, you can follow those social media linked on the store page or you can catch me on twitter, etc. @EimanTan.",
