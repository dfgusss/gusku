    "About the game": "Singers, comedians, and entertainers the spotlight is yours. Tell Jokes, sing songs or just kick back, relax and share stories with strangers in the crowd. Comedy Night is about watching raw and live talent on a virtual stage. If you are a performer see if you have what it takes to captivate an audience of friends and strangers from around the world.  You never know what you are going to get in Comedy Night it's always a new hilarious experience. The bar is always open, come join the party. LIVE PERFORMANCES Get up on stage, step up to the Mic and perform to a live audience in user-generated rooms. Collaborate or go head to head with other singers and comedians in the dual mic rooms. See how long you can stay on stage before being voted off or heckled. Comedy Night is a great sandbox to try out new material and see how well an audience responds to your performance.  BE PART OF THE AUDIENCE Be part of the audience and decide which performers stay or go by voting them off the stage. Heckle players or encourage them as they do their best to entertain you. Sometimes the audience can be funnier than the actual acts. Great banter with strangers goes a long way in Comedy Night. CREATE YOUR AVATAR Choose the perfect avatar that represents you or a new persona you want the world to see. With a whole bunch of hairstyles, bodies, hats, and glasses, you will be able to create a character that is unique and one that adds spice to your performance.",
