    "About the game": "Coins make you explode? Spikes make you bounce! All of this is normal in the world of Default Dan, a new indie platformer that flips the genre upside-down! Everything in the game does the opposite of what it appears. By using your own instincts against you, Default Dan aims to provide a humorous, mind-bending experience that anyone can enjoy. In this world, looks can be deceiving. Dan’s dimwitted best friend has been abducted by a mean-spirited little princess. In order to rescue his friend, Dan must defeat the princess and her army of cute minions. Everything is backwards: Coins, power-ups and hearts are deadly, while hazards and enemies help you out. It might sound simple, but you will have to retrain your brain and think backwards to survive! Over 20 stages of pure mayhem await across 4 different environments - new mechanics are introduced along the way to keep you on your toes. Compete with others for the fastest time. Every stage in Default Dan supports time-ranked leaderboards. Collect all 27 Steam Achievements by completing unique feats throughout the game! Original Sound Track by 'brentalfloss': Brent 'brentalfloss' Black lends his musical talents to the game!",
