    "About the game": "In this fast-paced action rogue-lite, play as Ember Knights, the last spark of hope of a universe in turmoil. Praxis, the mad sorcerer, has syphoned the life out of the Ember Tree and fled through the Prime Worlds spreading corruption in his path. In solo or co-op (up to 4 players), use powerful weapons and skills to hack and slash deadly hordes, defeat epic bosses, free the decaying Prime Worlds and restore energy to the Ember Tree! Legendary warriors, the Ember Knights are skilled in the wielding of more than a dozen weapons and skills… And many more to come during Early Access! However, the sword doesn’t make the knight… Through action-packed combat rooms, you’ll need to chain your attacks and perfectly time your skills to unleash fiery attacks. Agile and fearless, use your pace and dodge to outsmart and counter your enemies! Create unique and deadly builds by unlocking new skills, equipping game-changing relics and looting rare items. From a damage-resistant crowd-controlling swordsman to a poison spreading archer with summons, forge your own build during your runs. In co-op, coordinate with your friends to set up combos and synergies between your playstyles. Beasts, specters, sorcerers, and creatures of all sorts… Fight against dozens of unique monsters each with their own unique attacks and behaviors. Be prepared to face Elites and Champions, they are more resistant and deadlier versions of Praxis’ devoted minions. You will have to adapt your playstyle to each encounter and learn from your mistakes if you wish to succeed. Be on your guard as many more challenges will arrive throughout Early Access. The real challenge for the legendary Knights will lie in the epic bosses and their corrupted variations. From the Royal Phalanx to the Plague Bringer, Praxis will summon anything in his power to stop you. Try different builds, upgrade your Ember Tree and don't fear death. Persistence will be key!",
