    "About the game": "A new life begins.. The Age of Sophisticated Society has long passed and mother nature has done her job to restore balance and order. A new world filled with sprawling animal and plant life awaits you. It’s back to basics. Farming, hunting and proper shelter are once again your challenges. Will you overcome the world? Will you establish yourself, and then conquer it all? Help Jack survive, by any means. By force or by strategy, you choose. But because Jack is made out of only flesh and bones, he has to fit into the natural ecosystem around him. There’s always something Jack can get to eat, but also always something that wants to eat Jack.. Help Jack find food, water and clothes, build him a nice home, make it 4 storeys high, or make it 40 storeys high. Help him establish farms as far as the eye can see. Keep Jack warm by the fire, keep Jack dry. Help Jack build stronger and stronger tools so he can survive easier, and take care of bigger problems. A balanced world A world with temperature, weather, day and night for Jack to explore. Many types of pickups around for explorers, dams where Jack can catch fish with his fishing pole Go Hunting Make Jack a bow and send him out the door! Mostly he will be hunting for wolves and bears, both violent and dangerous animals. Equipped with a bow, strong armour and a good sense of aim, Jack will be eating his cooked bear meat soon Subsistence Farming Help Jack grow different types of veggies, farm by farm, water them and nurture them until harvest. Dinner sorted Construction Jack needs a place to sleep, chill and preferably not get wet when its already cold. Use 15+ construction parts to build him any home you can imagine, any shape or size. Resource management Jack must work carefully with what he’s got. If he keeps chopping away all the trees around his house, sooner than later he’s going to have to start travelling farther and farther for more wood. He must use the storage space he’s got to fit in everything he really needs and not hoard. Fishing Many strategies to survive in the long run are available to Jack, living next to a wolf nest is one way to secure a food supply, so is living next to a dam and catching dinner. Multiplayer Play with other Jacks, build homes and colonies together.",
