Tonight, at midnight, you'll have your chance. Physics based destruction - Launch data nodes and cybersecurity to crash them in a blaze of cyber explosions.

Breach their protocols and corrupt their mainframe - Break through a series of gates to gain access to their mainframe, then find a way to destroy it. Short and sweet runs - Random generation ensures no two runs are the same, and each one takes no more than 5 minutes to complete.
