    "About the game": "Faraway Islands is a top-down 2D story driven survival game, set on procedurally generated islands you can travel between and explore. Game contains classic survival mechanics like crafting based on combining, gathering resources and food, farming, hunting animals, increasing character skills, building shelter and defending from enemies. You play as a survivor of passenger ship that sank in wild storm. As you try to find a way home from these islands you encounter new friends, that will help you, and enemies giving you a hard time. All islands are procedurally generated, that means everything from its shape to number of crabs and mushrooms is randomly chosen and then created by predefined rules. Not all resources are the same on every island, so you must explore and find what you need. Creating items is done by combining or processing items in your inventory. These combinations are not shown to player from start, so you have to try new combinations. Some are recommended to you by story characters or written in quests. To ensure your safety from predators and enemies you can build your own shelter. Game has several basic buildings to choose and construct from and more are unlocked by increasing your skills. Wild animals are dangerous, and you should be cautious when moving around them. So beware that pack of tigers can kill you quite quickly. There are also human enemies that will attack every few days. You can prepare for these situations by crafting weapons and armor.",
