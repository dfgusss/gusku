    "About the game": "Dragonia, the castle of doom, has been resurrected! But the ghouls from the castle have stolen the Holy Goblet, the source of light. Without it, the world will be trapped in darkness forever. Don your armour and pick up your weapon. You’ll puncture green globs, break up ice bars and make dark ninjas and deadly hellfrogs vanish with your magic. You must also evade traps and break down walls to discover shortcuts. The village is anxiously awaiting the return of the Holy Goblet — and you!",
