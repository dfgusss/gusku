You decide how you want to play! There are 6 awesome gameplay modes: Training, Story, Ranked, Horde, FreePlay, and Arena. - Training: Practice a diverse range of moves against a training dummy/player or custom enemy group. - Story: The classic brawler mode - Ranked: Test your skill against the clock and build up a hi-score by linking attacks while avoiding damage. - Horde: Try to survive against increasing numbers of enemies, defeat as many waves as you can. - Freeplay: Choose if you want to be a hero or join the enemy ranks and see who comes out victorious. - Arena: Fight each other in multi-player vs mode. Incredible hybrid of advanced 2D sprites with completely customizable colors that are dynamically lit within the 3D world. Robust combat system inspired by fighting games, including: stand/crouch blocking, parry, back-dash, air-dash, action cancelling, cross-ups and much more.",
