    "About the game": "Forests of Augusta takes place in the forest where you will hunt wild animals and scavenge them for crafting materials. You will gather resources like wood, stone, iron to eventually build your own camp. You will have to defend your camp from wild animal attacks. With the gathered resources you can craft items like bows, arrows, potions and food. Ranked Game Mode: You will accumulate score points for your actions while the game time is not yet over. After the game time has completed you will be presented with your final score and have the possibility to compete on the leaderboards. After the game time is over you are still free to further explore the game. Roaming Mode: Explore the maps at your own pace. Hunt on wild animals but also for treasure. Level up and allocate stat points to further enhance your playstyle. Hunt, build, craft and explore the way you want. Horror Mode: You will have to survive in the forests at night where skeletons invade the forest. You will acquire experience points and level up while enemies also endlessly become more and more powerful. You are able to allocate stat points to further enhance your playstyle! When you die you get to submit your level score to the leaderboards. Exploration Mode: Coming Soon Explore a larger map complete with story quests, reputation to gain back after you got exiled, more crafting options, more weapons, armor and jewelry. Exploration mode turns the game in a survival game with RPG elements! Take on the Hirokez desert people, who were responsible for getting you exiled in the first place. Assault their temples with siege weapons and defeat their leaders in this war between the Augustians and the Hirokez. Explore a map filled with 'points of interest' which give you either a nice scenery or a interesting view over the map.",
