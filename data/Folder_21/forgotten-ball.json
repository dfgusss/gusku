    "Release date": "Mar 3, 2016",
    "About the game": "Forgotten Ball is a minimalist abstract platformer in an open world. Moving in 2.5 dimensions (well, 3) the ball must ascend a tower with little clues of who it came to be, or why the ball is there. Red primitives patrol the world, set out to stop ball wherever they can. Forgotten Ball features a unique automatic world rotation ability, where the world rotates 90 degrees to allow the ball to travel along a new plane. It's cool.",
