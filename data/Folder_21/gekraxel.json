    "About the game": "DISCLAIMER This is a VERY difficult game catered towards a more hardcore gaming audience. You're required to complete the tutorial to continue playing the game, and the tutorial takes less than 15 seconds once you understand the controls, but can take up to an hour to complete the first time. The game promotes competing for the best time, and to take risks. We've tried to minimize the amount of randomness in a gameplay to zero, so it's all about your skills. Good Luck! STORY In this post-apocalyptic world, sports has been redefined. Big skyscrapers previously housing thousands stand empty and are now the hot-spots for people competing in death-defying parkour. You start off at the top of the building and you must navigate through a maze of what remains of it to get to the bottom. It's not an easy feat as many lose their lives trying to make a name of themselves. To help build a fan base you can group up with others under a single team name and become the one name people think of when they think of Gekraxel. Run Jump Climb Fall",
