    "About the game": "Welcome to the futuristic and dangerous world of Glasswinged Ascension! As skilled operative, who possesses rare gift of so called Skepsiathy, you are to venture through top secret mission in goal to save innocent lives and uphold order. This hardcore game doesn't leave you much room for mistakes, and creates checkpoints only in the very beginning of each mission. Stealth and caution are your best friends here, as enemies require just one shot to kill you, there are a lots of deadly traps around, and even environment itself may become real problem if you will not proceed carefully. Obviously, not all rushed actions will become fatal, but they may still weaken you increasing chances to fail. Enemies are stronger, and once they'll spot you, they'll act fast and without hesitation, so what you will need to do is to outplay them tactically. Stay out of their sight, use sneaking stance to move around without making any noise, or turn off the lights to limit their visual detection capabilities. You will have both lethal and non-lethal weapons at your disposal. Kill enemies, disable them for a short period of time, or even sneak around without firing a single shot - it's fully up to you how to deal with the threat. Game's missions are not linear, so you will always have alternate routes. Keep in mind that all tripmines you've disarmed along your way can be used to destroy weak walls or floor, while exoskeletons will allow you to lift and move heavy objects or even pass through hazardous environments unharmed. Each mission pushes the story forward, so be sure to read all dialogues you'll encounter. Even though dialogues themselves are pretty linear, they are helping to build truly cyberpunk atmosphere, and give you some interesting themes to think about.",
