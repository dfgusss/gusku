    "About the game": "Can a lonely spirit find where it belongs? A story-based short 3D game with simple controls and multiple gameplays. You can experience the story seamlessly while playing the game. After finishing the main storyline, there are some more challenge levels for you to play. The player can go through the game with 4 arrow keys on the keyboard with a single hand, and relax without worrying about death and failure. The game is not very long in playtime (demo is about 10 mins, full-version is about 45~60mins). While developing, we avoided tiring and repetitive gameplay or text which is too long. Suitable for those who don't have much time to play games and want a change of mood. *This is NOT A HORROR GAME.",
