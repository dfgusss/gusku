    "About the game": "SuperHeroes the choice is yours in I Have Powers! Use your power to beat evil! I Have Powers! Is a make your own character SuperHero Arcade Game, where you design your custom Hero and enter a town brimming with crime and terror. From shooting Lightning Bolts from your hands to shooting FIRE, like a human flame thrower. You can do almost anything. Remember those Plastic Superheroes you used to buy in the toy store? Pretending to make them fight each other? Well, you can do that in this game, make your character, fight bad guys and level up your character into an unstoppable conqueror. Use your secret identity to survey a situation before revealing your costume and powers! Lots of different powers to try out and make 100's of unique characters! Do you want to wield weapons like Commando, or Fly around like Superman, it's your character and you can make as many as you want, beware though because this is a roguelike game where your character gets deleted if they get defeated. How long can your character exist? How powerful can they become?",
