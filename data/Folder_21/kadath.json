Players investigate a case of a Nazi train which vanished along with one of its passengers, Elisa Schneider, sometime during World War II only to reappear in the Himalayas 75 years later. A long time ago... At the height of its power, the Third Reich extended over an area of more than five million square kilometres.

While warrants for their arrest were issued, none of them was captured. Nor was any trace found of the lost train. Until now… Present... May 2016. Two weeks ago a group of Sherpa mountain guides returning from an aborted Australian expedition to Annapurna came across an exhausted woman. Because she was severely hypothermic communication was impossible: the Sherpas only managed to pick out a few German words. Soon afterwards the woman died. However, there were a few puzzling details: she was wearing a 1940s two-piece German costume with an NSDAP brooch, whereas the documents that were found in her purse indicated that she had been born in Dachau in 1917, although she couldn’t have been much older than 25. Her name was Elisa Schneider and she was among the passengers on the lost train…",
