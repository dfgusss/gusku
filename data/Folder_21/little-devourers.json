    "About the game": "Little Devourers is a Point &amp; Click physics game in which you play as a black hole that is swallowing up all the garbage that humanity produces. This is not a massive action game, it is not a complex game with endless puzzles. However, if you want to play something relaxing that works as a kind of therapy to de-stress after losing several matches in the rankings, this is the ideal game for you. 'Veni, vidi, vici'",
