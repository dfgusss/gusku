    "About the game": "Unique system ‘rewind’ Use the rewind ability to save your position, then use it again to return to that position without any interruption. If you use your abilities well, you can pass through seemingly impossible attacks or obstacles. Also, rewind can be used during combat. By attacking the enemy while rewinding, some or all of the damage taken can be refunded. Use this actively to help with limited recovery means! Various movement actions Combining rewind with moving actions such as 'dash' to move a long distance at once and 'climbing up a wall' to create multiple movements, and actively utilize the surrounding terrain to create challenging platforming difficulties. Variety of upgrades In addition to simple stat-increasing upgrades, take advantage of the ‘artifact’ system that allows you to flexibly change your character according to the situation. Artifacts provide their own powerful upgrades, and Artifacts can be replaced at any time while resting. There are also 3 powerful spells available to assist with basic attacks. Unlock upgrades through exploration! Challenging Expeditions Explore 4 different themed areas! Defeat or dodge menacing enemies that stand in your way, and solve the puzzles that exist there to advance. Explore puzzles, combine abilities to design your own route, and break through puzzles with quick wits!",
