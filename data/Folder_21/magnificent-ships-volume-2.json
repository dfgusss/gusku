    "About the game": "Model ship lovers rejoice again! This is another collection of six finely-detailed vessels for viewing at both 'model' and 'actual' size with a VR headset. Stroll their decks as they sail upon a beautifully-rendered ocean with dynamic day/night cycle. Remotely control them at model-scale on a park 'boating' pond, where you can compete against a 'ghost-ship' to capture the most buoys, or pick them up for a closer look. Each ship includes an 'action' event while at sea, whereby mighty cannons fire, ship horns bellow, or the submarine dives. Included Ships: First-rate ship of the line: HMS Victory Ford class aircraft carrier: USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN-78) Research Vessel: RV Calypso Ocean liner: RMS Queen Mary 2 German submarine: U-boat Type VII-C/41 (U-659) Icebreaker: USCGC Healy (WAGB-20) Note: this is a standalone experience and does not require Volume 1.
