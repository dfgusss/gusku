    "About the game": "ENTER THE MAZE WITH “MAZEMAN” - A FAST-PACED CHALLENGE WITH BEAUTIFUL PIXEL ART! MAZEMAN is an arcade game that will challenge you big time thanks to its frantic pace. Enter the maze and look for the key while avoiding all kinds of dreadful monsters. Lots of unlockables, monsters, levels, power-ups, and collectibles await you in this beautiful, endless stream of pixel art mazes filled with some awesome arcade vibes! A COLORFUL GROUP OF HEROES &amp; A MAZE FULL OF DANGERS In MAZEMAN, you will start only with the main hero… MAZEMAN. But there are 23 more heroes waiting to be unlocked, each one with a unique ability. A robot whose mission is to bomb the maze to its foundations; a time-stopping time traveller that seems haunted by its past; a talented escapist that will force you to think with portals; a psychic girl willing to prove to her tribe that she’s just as capable as the boys… but at what price? All of the characters add their own twist to the game experience thanks to their unique abilities. A specific floor may be almost impossible with one character and incredibly easy with another. So you can strategize which character may be the best fit for each level... or just play with the one that fits your playstyle the best! But be prepared for a Maze that’s dangerously equipped to destroy you, as it packs a myriad of creatures, bosses, and mini-bosses. You must traverse all the mazes with their unique architectures and visual styles, fighting or avoiding the monsters while looking for the key that will open the door to the next maze. Luckily, the Maze holds some helpful power-ups too! SET YOUR OWN GOALS Do you want to get to the next maze? Just look for the key and go to the door! Easy, right? But if you like a real challenge, go for the extra achievement needed to unlock everything in the game: collecting the 3 hidden gems that lay in the most dangerous corners of every floor. With this system, the player can always choose how big of a risk they’re willing to take on at every level. THE SECRETS BEHIND THE MAZE… A CRYPTIC NARRATIVE AWAITS YOU All mazes are part of a huge maze known as… The Maze. Somehow, all our heroes have ended up there for their own reasons. MAZEMAN is a pulp sci-fi styled cryptic adventure where everything is surrounded by mystery. The narrative is often hidden to the player’s eye, and only by beating levels can the player will unlock small narrative bits. The truth might never be revealed completely… collect the bread crumbs and figure out what is The Maze and what’s the secret behind it. FEATURES: - BEAUTIFUL PIXEL ART - This game is packed with stunning pixel visuales. A true treat for the eyes! - LOTS OF PLAYSTYLES TO CHOOSE - There are 24 available characters, each with its own unique ability. Bombs, guns, swords, shields, mind control, sprints, portals… choose your style and enter The Maze! - LOTS OF DANGERS TO FIGHT - An abundance of monsters and bosses make this a true challenge. SET YOUR OWN GOALS - The game is fairly difficult, but you can go from challenging to nerve-wrecking by setting your own goals, from just finding the key to collecting the 3 gems of each maze. You can also choose a character whose ability makes the level easier... or go for the most challenging ones! - A FRANTIC PACE - Our most basic inspiration here is clearly Pac-Man: we look for an experience that is fast-paced so it tests your ability and nerves! Your character NEVER STOPS GOING FORWARD (unless it hits a wall, I guess). - A CRYPTIC NARRATIVE -Unfold a mysterious narrative by unlocking very small narrative bits that will serve as bread crumbs… you’ll never get to know THE MAZE’s whole story, but with enough bits you might start to figure out some things while building some theories!",
