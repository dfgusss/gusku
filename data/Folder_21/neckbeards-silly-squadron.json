    "About the game": "The toughest arcade challenge yet. Insert coin if you dare. Silly Squadron is a retro-futuristic take on Space Invaders, the arcade classic from 1978. It has all the Soiree ingredients you're craving for: fast action, addictive gameplay, strange boss fights (including a mighty middle-aged man) and a seriously sumptuous soundtrack. Commandeer a variety of cannons, each offering unique qualities and/or weapons systems Team up with a buddy in local co-op (or tag team with your CPU if you are friendless) Watch out for kamikaze beta males, master cucks, and a dozen more special enemies Befriend invaders to have them join you as meat-shields in the next level Clear seven worlds of enemies to enter Deluge, the hardest single non-stop level in any arcade game, ever! (even the pause-mode is disabled in Deluge)",
