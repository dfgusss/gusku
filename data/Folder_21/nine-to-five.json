    "About the game": "Nine to Five is a Free-to-Play 3v3v3 team-based First-Person Shooter! Set in a future where corporations rule and being their mercenary is just a regular day job, collaboration and smart team play are what get the job done around here – not just pure reflexes. Working with your co-mercenaries in a team of three, you will tackle changing objectives in each match, keeping everyone on their toes. Optimize your loadouts, mod your favorite weapons and make a killing! Governments, as we currently know them, are defunct and replaced by corporations who will stop at nothing to destroy their comp- we mean, save the planet and serve humanity. Complete gigs for our corporate overlords Farmira, Mash Media, New World Finance and Milodyne to climb the corporate ladder! You face off with two other teams of mercenaries, set out to complete the same objectives as you. Take advantage of a multitude of gadgets to help you and your co-mercenaries in your efforts - deploy drones to gather information and stay aware of your surroundings, or decoys to throw your adversaries off. Teamwork is key to finding success in the dynamically changing matches! In addition to competent colleagues, you’ll need the best tools available to make a killing as a mercenary. With a wide range of weapons and mods in the arsenal, you will be able to customize your loadout to best suit your play style. This will make your climb up the corporate ladder much more fun (and violent). From the streets of Old New York to the deserts of Varmstaad and building complexes of the Huxwell Clinic, you’ll have beautiful vistas to admire. Also, you will be shot at, so you'd better not admire the scenery too much. Worry not, the shifts are brief, and you will get a chance to go again at short notice. #LearningOpportunities Key Features Climb the corporate ladder from Junior to Master Mercenary levels Nine player matches, with three teams of three mercs going against each other Three unique maps with five different game modes Customizable and upgradeable weapons and loadouts Various tools and gadgets to give you an edge over the competition Join our community Share your feedback and discuss with the devs on our Discord channel:",
