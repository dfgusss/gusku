Playing well will be rewarded with killstreaks, like a radar, a bomber plane or a bomb you can control falling down on the map. Also, the higher your killstreak is, the stronger your soldier will get. For example faster sprint speed, and a little bit more health. You can play on 12 different maps, set on all kinds of different locations. Operation Lone Wolf has small and fast paced maps, and big, more open maps for a little bit more tactical gameplay, so there are many gameplay options available for the players.
