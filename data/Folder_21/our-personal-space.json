I usually don't play video games, but easily got lost in the intriguing plot twists, mystery, and ethical dilemmas of this complex story.' -Catherine White, author of Cupcake Girl 'Reiterates the fact that marriage is not the 'happily ever after.' It's the 'once upon a time.' Charming and well-written; equal parts relatable and sci-fi.' -Mary Tueller Whipple 'Delivers a heart-warming (or heart-breaking!) tale of two space colonists far from anything they might call familiar.' -Lance Meibos",
