    "About the game": "P.A.I.N.T. is an online cooperative third-person shooter where you join the P.U.N.K.S. The P.U.N.K.S are a bunch of rebels that hang around in their ultimate hideout. They despise order and structure thus try to correct the world with their paint blasters. There is just one thing standing in their way, the sinister S.U.I.T.S. corporation. They manufacture their mundane suits in their massive grim factory. Together with the P.U.N.K.S. you forge a plan to invade the S.U.I.T.S. factory. You penetrate the factory door with your badass minivan and armed with your paint blaster you cover the environment in bright colours. Cooperative Play You can now infiltrate the factory together. The game allows you to play in cooperative mode with up to 4 players. Only one online? That is fine, the solo adventure awaits you in P.A.I.N.T. Powerful Paint Blasters Easy to learn and hard to master, that is the paint blaster. Use the paint blaster to bring havoc into the massive factory. Time Based Score System You have 10 minutes to complete as many challenges and reach for the top of the leaderboard, but be aware that every decision counts and may affect your score. Individual and team scores are visible on the leaderboard at the end of every match. Hangout Team HUB Get together with your team in the pre-game lobby. The pre-game lobby supports target practise to improve your skills with the paint blaster. P.A.I.N.T. is developed by a student team of Breda University of Applied Sciences. The project will continue till the end of June 2020.",
