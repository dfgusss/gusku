    "About the game": "Pixel Killers - The Showdown is a shared screen local and/or online multiplayer game that you can play with friends (or foes, take your pick). Features: -2 to 4 players -Top-down -Local multiplayer shared screen -Two game modes - Deathmatch and Deal gone bad, hold the cash -All vs All, 2 vs 2, 2 vs 1 + sentry -8 maps -Move in ANY of 8 directions while shooting in ANY of 360 directions! -Multiple pixels handled on-screen at the same time! -Has music and sound effects! This game was made out of a passion for playing with friends. The market for local multiplayer seems a little underserved on the PC platform. This game strives to help promote couch games on PC. Hopefully, there will be many more games aiming at couch gaming for the PC. Online gaming is great fun, but it ain't the same as having a sit-down with your friends and tell them to their face how much they suck at video games! A little practical info: This game is built for Wired Xbox 360 controllers or Wireless Xbox 360 controllers with a wireless receiver adapter for PC. Xbox One controllers ought to work just fine. PS3 and PS4 controllers can be used with Xinput drivers/wrappers. Other controllers that are Xinput compatible should also work.",
