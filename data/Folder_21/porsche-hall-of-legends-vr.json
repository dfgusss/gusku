    "About the game": "The Hall of Legends is an exciting VR brand experience based on momentous stories: Witness iconic moments from the history of Porsche Motorsport, discover the secrets behind the success of Porsche, and collect the Porsche DNA to unlock the new Porsche Formula E car. From the past into the future The main components of the Hall of Legends are five vehicles that symbolize Porsche's decades of success and demonstrate Porsche's innovative character. The vehicles Egger Lohner C.2 Phaeton (1894), 550 Spyder (1954), 917 (1970), Tag Turbo (engine; 1981) and 919 Hybrid (2018) can be virtually explored. Each vehicle offers you information and anecdotes, together with an influential individual from the respective era. On top you can 'relive' iconic moments from Porsche Motorsport history e.g. like waving the checkered flag, while standing on the Le Mans racetrack as the Porsche 917 crosses the finish line to perform the first overall victory at Le Mans in 1970.  Or you can become the co-driver in the 550 Spyder at the Mille Miglia 1954, where Hans Herrmann and Herbert Linge ducked away under a railway barrier at the last moment and thus escaped the approaching train. Find out how these and other stories are related to Porsche's numerous victories. As a reward, you will get an insight into the future of Porsche Motorsport: the new Porsche Formula E vehicle. And not to forget: Meet Ferry, the virtual Archivist, keeper of all knowledge from 70 years of Porsche. WARNING Application not suitable for people with fear of heights. Some may experience discomfort (nausea). Don’t play this game if you are susceptible to motion sickness.",
