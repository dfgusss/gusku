    "About the game": "FPS walking simulator type psychological horror game. It is set in an abandoned Western-style building in the mountains of Japan. The story progresses as you explore. Find items such as keys, or use the zoom feature (right stick press / right click) to explore. There are no action elements such as running away or fighting. Explore at your own pace. Story She got lost in the mountains and it was raining. And she shelters in the ruins she accidentally finds. However, the rain does not stop even at night. The smartphone can't even call for help outside the service area, and she spends the night in her ruins. There is no electricity in the ruins and it is pitch black. Only the light of the smartphone is reliable. And when I was exploring the ruins, I heard crying out of nowhere ... Graphic High image quality is created with a realistic immersive feeling in mind. Please enjoy the creepy and unpleasant feeling. If the processing is heavy, please lower the image quality in the in-game settings. You can access the settings screen from the home screen or from the pause menu you are playing. Character voice Only Japanese voice is supported (using AI voice synthesis technology software 'VOICEPEAK').",
