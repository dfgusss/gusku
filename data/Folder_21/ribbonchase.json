    "About the game": "The design source of 'Ribbon Chase' is not a story, not a function, not a technology, but an experience. In the early stages of design, we wanted to create an unrestrained experience. We closed our eyes and imagined how free we were. Our first thought was that we were flying in the sky, prompting us to design 'Ribbon Chase' - a game featuring a paper plane sailing through the mountains and above the sea, traveling around the world, collecting fans of the wind god’s blessings. Player experience: · Childhood fun: Every child plays with paper airplanes. “Ribbon Chase” satisfies the player’s desire to fly your paper aircraft. · Unrestrained flight: There is no fixed track. Players freely explore. Each level features special attractions from earth. We combined our imagination with reality in lowpoly style. While sailing through each level, players switch between fantasy and reality. “Ribbon Chase” features a variety of style and color, so players remain engaged. 'Ribbon Chase' breaks the traditional paradigm of traditional flight games, refines the game play, and retains simplicity. “Ribbon Chase” is different from many games that allow players to travel between heaven and earth, race and shoot. On the contrary, with the beauty of simplicity, “Ribbon Chase” allows a player to experience the beauty of freedom and solitude and the fun of leisure and entertainment with beautiful scenery and music.",
