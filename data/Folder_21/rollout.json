    "About the game": "Rollout is in Early Access. It's not finished. There are bugs. As of now, there is a maximum of 20 players at one time. Rollout is a multiplayer eat-to-grow, '.io' style game but, unlike others that you may have played, I've added an extra dimension. The goal is to grow as big as you can while not being eaten. The rules are simple: Eat anything smaller than you and avoid anything bigger. Controls: Aim with mouse WASD to move Space to jump when you're big enough Click to boost when you're big enough Hold space to climb buildings when you're big enough Use the scroll wheel to adjust how far the camera can see. Shorter distance == better performance.",
