    "About the game": "Slamoids is a small, re-playable, single player arcade score-chaser. It's a twin stick shooter in which the player must dodge and shoot incoming slamoids while at the same time avoid touching the ever shrinking, growing, and moving red ring that surrounds them. Each time a slamoid crashes into the player, 1 life is lost. If the user touches the red ring, they lose all lives and it’s game over. Thank you so much for checking out Slamoids! We sincerely hope it provides you plenty of entertainment. If you encounter any issues along the way or just want to say hello, feel free to reach out to us on Twitter or through our website. We're always looking for feedback so we can improve, so don't hesitate to reach out!
