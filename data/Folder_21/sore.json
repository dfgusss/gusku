    "About the game": "'Sometimes I remember things that didn’t happen, does it happen to you?' Mystical puzzle quest game in a gloomy minimalism style will tell you a story of a person who's got himself into a camera, and from which there is no way out it seems. Experimental gameplay diluted with a pinch of a philosophy, that's what SORE is. The game gives the following opportunities: To think over objectivity of player's actions aiming at achieving the desired. To live through the pain of accepting the inevitable reality which finally will grant freedom. To understand an importance of inner human freedom in common life. To try a chaotic cocktail of an experimental gameplay, a quest and a gloomy atmosphere which provides a fake chance. To feel the 'five steps of acceptance' by yourself. To fail with seeking out the ending you want but find it's brother which has to be accepted. To find a symbolism there where it is not. Not to find a symbolism there where it is. To dive into melancholy. To imagine your plotting in which you will believe. To recall that what was forgotten.",
