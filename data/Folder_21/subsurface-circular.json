    "About the game": "MEET THE LOCALS, PICK UP THE LINGO A detective stationed on the Subsurface Circular investigates a series of disappearances among the city’s robotic working class. Collect words and phrases, then use them in dialogue puzzles to uncover the world's secrets and determine its future. Inspired by classic adventure games and modern dialogue systems, Bithell Games has created a single session story which respects your time and your intelligence. Key Features A mature, polished, one-sitting game. Developed by the award-winning team behind Thomas Was Alone and Volume. A graphical twist on the classic text-based adventure. Uses 'Focus Points', a unique vocabulary-based inventory system. Original soundtrack by Dan Le Sac.  Comprehensive art gallery featuring the detailed work that went into this world.  Unlockable ‘BithellBot’, our interactive take on a developer’s commentary. FAQs If this game is ‘short’, what’s to stop me getting a refund when I’m done? You’re browsing Steam, which means you understand the work that goes into games, and are in principle up for paying for ones that entertain you. We hope that after a bit of time with Subsurface Circular, you’ll feel good about the price you paid. Do I need to have played other Bithell games to enjoy this one? No. Subsurface Circular tells its own self contained story. Why is the game only available in English? As you can imagine, a text adventure game contains a terrifying amount of text, but more importantly, throughout the game we use the particular quirks of word ordering and double meaning in English to support the combination and recombination of threads. Put simply, other languages are going to be more than a straight translation: They’re going to need rewrites and changed design. Not impossible, but more than we could get done this time around. If the game proves successful, we’d like to revisit this.",
