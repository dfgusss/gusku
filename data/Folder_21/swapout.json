Starting with your basic weapon, you will loot and find new attachments for your gun, this can range from different bodies on the gun to different fire rates and bullet types. A new attachment known as Chips can turn your gun into a monstrosity, ranging from adding an extra barrel to your gun, to making your bullets oversized. They make the wildest guns come true. Your gun is in your complete control. You will encounter different types of enemies and explore different environments that may suit your playstyle, or test what you can do when taken our of your comfort zone. The world is procedurally generated, no two runs are the same.",
