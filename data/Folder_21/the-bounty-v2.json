    "About the game": "The Bounty V2 is a 4th wall breaking adventure which blends gameplay styles from traditional JRPGs, Roguelikes, and puzzle games, while adding a deep score system to drive the experience further. Players explore top-down levels full of monsters, hazards, secrets, and treasures. Battles are kept simple with an ebb and flow resembling the traditional style of Dragon Quest. Your character's attributes level up the way you choose; coupled with balanced gear options, you get an equally challenging, balanced experience while playing your character your way. In the Story Mode, the player selects their difficulty level, names their character (including secret avatars via codes), and begins their journey through a concise adventure across four episodes. Some levels, treasures, riddles, and monsters are shuffled in each playthrough. This adds variety while retaining the experience of learning the game and maps. In Casual Mode, the score system is disabled, and the player gains the ability to save freely, including an autosave feature. This mode lets the player enjoy the game at their own pace, and practice to score higher in Competitive Mode. Competitive Mode is the more difficult primary game mode, with each monster, puzzle, treasure, and secret awarding points. With hundreds of scenarios, secrets, and bonuses, players have a virtually endless challenge awaiting them to get the highest score. Furthermore, completing the game opens Endless Dungeon +, allowing the player to play in the Endless Dungeon with their existing character, pushing their score to never-ending heights. New to V2 is Adventure Mode. In Adventure Mode, you find yourself *playtesting* a new and incomplete nonlinear game mode. Tasked with piecing together the Blade of Legends so you can enter the castle and defeat the final boss. This blade can also be powered up by finding the seven Legendary Orbs hidden within the dungeons- but these are completely optional. Will you rush the castle as quickly as you can, or take your time finding the orbs and boosting your score as high as you can? This pushes the envelope a bit more on the 4th wall breaking side; with some pretty big surprises. There are bound to be a few laughs, but you'll have to wait to play it yourself! The Endless Dungeon is also selectable as a separate mode. In this mode, players begin with a full loadout of gear and journey through a never-ending, always-changing dungeon. This is the perfect mode to play when you want to get in a quick game but you're short on time! Also features Endless Dungeon +, which when playing on Competitive Mode, allows you to enter an endless dungeon after completing the main game, giving endless challenges and opportunities to blast your scores into the stratosphere. *A truly unique score based, fast paced competitive RPG. *Gameplay heavy/Story light. A challenging RPG that you can pick up and play. *Impeccably balanced- every player choice has equal value in strengths and weaknesses, every path has the same scoring potential. *Hundreds of secrets and fourth-wall breaking easter eggs- a true celebration in gaming culture and history. *Stylized visuals, audio, and gameplay hearken back to Japanese 16-bit console RPGs while embracing Western PC-centric designs and sensibilities. *Fully compatible with keyboard, mouse, and controller support *Free Post-launch content updates keep the game fresh with new scenarios, endless level packs, player and dungeon skins, and more!",
