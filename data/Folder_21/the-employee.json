    "About the game": "The Employee is a first-person game where you play a web developer in a big company. You applied for a job offer and today is the day, you're going to sign your contract. Want to refuse? Well, you'll go back to your appartment and you can apply again later with your personal computer. Work Once you're incorporated to the company, you'll have access to your desktop and your professional computer. On that PC, you'll be able to play some mini-games (classify files, fix bugs, calculus...). All these activities will make you earn happiness points. Fun You are bored to work? No problem, you can enjoy many things to do in the office. You can buy a soda or a snack, eat a burger or make a coffee and it is recomended to do it often or you're gonna have problems. You also have to use the toilets and wash your hands (this is important), if you're not clean and smell weird, you won't be able to use vendor machines and people will avoid you. You can also have a walk outside to play basketball or smoke a cigarette if you're a smoker (we encourage you no to smoke and find other ways to be happy). Gameplay Talk to your colleagues to know if they need something. They probably have missions for you and complete those missions will make you earn money and happiness points. Coffee A good developper drinks a lot of coffee. If you don't drink enough coffee you will be tired. If you're tired, you will be less productive, and if you're less productive, you're fired. Grab/throw There are many items in the office that can be grabbed and thrown. But some of them are 'mission items' that can't be thrown because they have a special function that you have to find. Most of the time, one of your colleague will ask you for a task that consists to find an object and/or do an action with it. Cleanliness For hygienic reasons, wash your hands often. You will find the toilets down the hall. Try to keep your workspace clean. Thank you. Controls Controls have been simplified to the maximum. Most of action can be done with left clic and right clic and you can walk with W. Story The Employee is not only a fun game about throwing things in an office, you can finish the game if you choose the right options and the second part of the game will see the player facing several emotions like sadness and revenge. If something bad would happen, would you find your way to escape?",
