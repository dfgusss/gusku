RETRO GAMEPLAY AND 1V1 PIZZA COMBAT The Final Specimen is a comedic sci-fi adventure game in the style of the classic 2D platformers of the '90s. Packed with whimsical settings and eccentric characters, this energetic, challenging title brings an exciting take to old-school gaming. The story begins when our hero, a young earthling, is transported to a distant planet. After facing sudden assault from the world's inhabitants, he soon finds out that his arrival is no coincidence. He is the only one who can prevent a nefarious alien foe from unleashing a terrible plot to rain destruction upon their home. The game's environments range from interstellar highways and sprawling cities to overgrown catacombs and creepy basements filled with enemies who want your head. From rope swings to disappearing platforms, there is never a shortage of new obstacles to navigate. And if the ability to punch your enemies' lights out isn't enough, you can always collect ammunition: your personal stash of bombs and more bombs. You are the culmination of years of alien experimentation. You are the only human who stands a chance. You are THE FINAL SPECIMEN.",
