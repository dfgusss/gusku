    "About the game": "The Girl Who Sees is a point-and-click adventure and turn-based RPG hybrid that explores WWII history and Philippine fantasy. In 1945, a village girl Quina survives under Japanese occupation. She helps a dwarf translate a mysterious scroll in hopes it will explain why she sees Tagalog words wherever she turns. Aid both human and magical, fight mythical foes, and restore balance to the realm. Choose your gameplay style: - Battle Mode: Level up by fighting in turn-based battles. - Discovery Mode: Level up by answering trivia on Philippine culture, history, and lore. This game was created through a crowdfunding campaign and through the support of the Filipinx-American community.
