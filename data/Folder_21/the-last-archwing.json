    "About the game": "The Last Archwing is a fast paced, vertically scrolling space shooter. You assume the role of Chet Brickhouse, the sole survivor of Earth's defense fleet. Pilot Earth's most advanced star fighter, the Archwing, to stop the advancing hordes of aliens from the invading Zarkhan Empire. Each level of the game is replete with fully voiced dialogue sequences that bring the colorful characters and the world of The Last Archwing to life. Save Earth together with friends! The game fully supports up to four player cooperative play, either local or online using Steam's Remote-Play-Together feature! You must fight your way through an entire fleet of unique enemies and bosses. Destroyed enemies will reward the player with upgrade credits and power-up capsules to collect. Credits may be spent in between levels to upgrade your ship's weapons, shields, and special abilities. Collected capsules will charge up the player's special meter. Charges of the meter may be spent to perform a Barrel Roll, which quickly maneuvers the player out of harm's way and offers temporary invincibility. A fully charged meter can be expended to fire the Super Death Wave, a powerful screen clearing weapon. The game has a range of difficulty levels that will be sure to challenge players of all skill levels. Looking for a greater challenge? Enter hardcore mode where you have to take on the enemy with only one life, but once that life is over your score will be uploaded to the leaderboards, compete with the community to see who can take first place! Will you take up the mantle as Earth's last defender and thwart the plans of the evil Emperor Zarkhan?",
