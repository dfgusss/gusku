    "About the game": "The Undead is a first-person shooter that takes place in a cemetery. You must fight waves of zombies and skeletons. You start off with 500 dollars. Every kill adds to your money. You use that money to open a door , buy ammo and buy guns. The ammo is located where the beams of light are. You have to open up the cement coffin and jump inside to buy your ammo. When you reach 30 kills you'll be confronted against a fearsome foe. See how long you can survive for.",
