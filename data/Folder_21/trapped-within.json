With no one in sight, she decides to escape and try to return home. As you tread through each room trying to find a way out, you learn that some rooms are trapped, but which is safe and which isn't? Can you spot/identify which room is trapped? If not, will the trap kill you or simply mess with you? Can you escape the maze or be Trapped Within?",
