Plan a good old fashioned heist using force, logic, and everything you can get your hands on across five old west towns. Tumblefire features a fully burnable and interactive environment where emergent gameplay through your choices are a pillar of design. Build structures by stacking together objects in the world around you. Use floating objects in tricky ways to your advantage. Plan out your heist and take your time to create the optimal path and execute it. Do what you have to do to destroy and steal whatever your bosses ask you to. Just be sure you don't get caught. Campaign You're a drifting pyromaniac who picks up work from shady characters to make ends meet. Before long you find yourself deeply entangled in a tale of greed, revenge, and vengeance. Starting out with some petty neighborhood squabbles, burning down an outhouse or two, you soon find yourself torching gambling dens, train stations, the mayors deed to the town and more. Upgrade your tools of the trade and the fire around you by stealing valuables and completing missions. Just don't burn your loot! Sandbox You can play in various scenes with the tools you unlock. Don't worry, in this mode you have unlimited resources. No pressure, just pleasure. Features Fully burnable low-poly environment with dozens of buildings Realistic simulation of fire Multiple different tools including torches, planks, and molotovs Campaign drenched in Old West drama with a cast of interesting characters Sandbox mode for you to roam around in the various scenes",
