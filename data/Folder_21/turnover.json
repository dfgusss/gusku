Enlist the help of Rent a Cops to help you take down patrols. Find hidden perks to help you gain the edge and increase your chances of survival. 3 difficulty modes are available to suit your play style: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

Refer to extras/CustomLevelDocumentation/index.html for details. Story In near future America, the emergence of corporate monopolies has placed a strangle hold on the economy. Among a glut of mass privatization, corporations begin contracting private military security firms to protect their assets. Setting a controversial precedent, defense contractor Grand Robotics Inc. deploys a private security firm to be their 'Mergers &amp; Acquisitions' arm. After a failed attempt to buy out competing Bartleby Automation, Grand Robotics turns to their security firm to execute a 'hostile takeover' of their competitor. The firm storms into Bartleby's corporate HQ and locks the building down. In Turnover you play Clea Holden, a Bartleby worker who becomes caught in the middle of the crisis. Coming to the conclusion that the situation is too volatile, Clea hatches a desperate plan to escape. She must find freedom, armed with only her determination to survive.",
