    "About the game": "Just how far can YOU dash? In this arcade style NES-like take on an action command based RPG battle system, join Valley and a cast of her friends, allies, and begrudged acquaintances as they challenge hordes of monsters. Each victory rewards you with just a little more distance, and a whole new wave of foes. Procedural, seed generated gameplay! If you find a seed you particularly like, you can play it again and again! Play as over a dozen different unlockable heroes, each with their own action commands and attack styles. Crazy and wild items! Rewind time with a clock! Become an unmovable, invulnerable boulder with the stone mask! Share a bunch of bananas with your entire party! Even hurl a big old rock at your foes! High scores! Laugh at your friends as you dash farther than them. Rub your victory in their faces. Diverse cast of monsters, with random upgrades! From ordinary blobs to tricky mimics, from sneaky ghosts to mighty bear chombers, the further through your dash, the more upgrades the monsters will have! Need some help? Use pine cones to purchase a contract and enlist the help of another hero! Buy upgrades from the shop and feel their power course through you! Find a hero or monster you're not yet familiar with? Check the bestiary during your turn to get a quick overview, complete with a comment from Valley! The dash continually beckons. Will you answer its call?",
