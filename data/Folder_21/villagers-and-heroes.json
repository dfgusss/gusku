    "About the game": "Enter a magical, 3D fantasy world filled with hundreds of unique locales, immersive lore, and exciting quests -- and it's all free to play. Join thousands of players from around the world, and be part of a one of a kind community. From the sandy shores of Traven to the emerald forests of Greenhaven, from the sparkling hills of Glittermore to the icy peaks of Stormhold, you will journey through a land filled with majestic sights, unusual characters in need of a hero, and you will uncover the mysteries of the Black Thrush, the mustering of the Stone Lord’s secret army, and ultimately the stirrings of the return of Mallok the terrible. Entering the tower of Mallok, you will face a villain in the guise of a charming and generous prince; another with a beautiful voice of song whose chilling notes will enthrall the unwary; Zikiti, the brood mother of the arachnid horde, the she-demon of Bandicott woods; and Egan, the Ogre Overlord of Mulgrew Swamp. These are just a few of the thousands of villains and locales that will challenge your wits and determination in your journey through the Seven Realms. Fortunately, you won’t have to face them alone! Join a village with friends, new and old, and together construct superior facilities to create magical weapons and enchanted gear. In your garden, you can raise crops and tend to your pets in order to concoct potions of power. You can forge unique, custom gear to outfit your character -- or trade with friends to help them out. And, of course, you can always put your crafts up for sale in the Auction House. Villagers and Heroes is not your typical 3D MMO. It’s much more. Come see why. Your friends are waiting for you.

Story-Driven Quests and Intriguing Lore Delve into the lore of V&amp;H! Learn about The Legendary Four – Marat, Celestia, Voltan and Calypso—those valiant heroes and the first of their classes, who came together during the nightmarish Shadow Years and sacrificed their lives to defeat the evil tyrant, Mallok, and his army of monstrosities. Light and prosperity were restored to the land, but foul creatures and twisted beasties still hunger for the darkness of old, and will stop at nothing to reclaim their savage rule of the realms. Challenging quests rife with mystery and danger await!",
