Use the Vive controller to quickly move all around the spherical field of play. Race! Collect data packets by either running over them or encircling them with your tail. Snatch them up before time expires and packets become red and infected. Capture! Get as many flying packets as you can for bonus points if you capture all packets before the wave timer expires. Collect! The more packets you collect, the more bombs you get to use. Destroy! Use bombs to destroy enemy viruses and infected packets near you. Challenges! Compete on the leaderboard in over 10 unique game modes.",
