At the place where the card falls, a warrior appears who will attack the enemy’s tower or the nearest enemy himself. The range of the card’s flight depends on the power of your throw. The further the warrior appears from the card, the longer the reanimator will fly to revive him. When enemy warriors are coming you can shoot at them from a bow, making damage. Besides you, your side towers of the Princess shoot at enemy warriors too. You need to destroy the central tower of the enemy to win the battle.
