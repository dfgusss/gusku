    "About the game": "STEP INTO A LIMITLESS UNIVERSE Touchdown in the World of Twelve and set off on a great adventure in WAKFU, an original massively multiplayer online role playing universe where humor goes hand in hand with action-packed, tactical battles. Climb Mount Zinit in search of Ogrest, the fearsome ogre behind the cataclysm that devastated the World, or mark your own path across the archipelagos where the denizens of this world feverishly work to rebuild their once mighty nations. Become a warrior, politician, merchant, or craftsman, but whatever you choose... IN WAKFU, EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON YOU! Tired of brainlessly running through the forest pressing 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, on every monster that jumps on you? Discover our turn-based tactical combat system, and develop a more creative strategy to defeat monsters that will keep challenging your tactical skills. No standard knight, ranger, mage and cleric here. Discover our 18 classes, each with their unique set of skills and gameplay. From Foggernauts, the robot wreckers, to Xelors, masters of time, you're sure to find the character that's right for you. Live exciting adventures, explore lots of unique dungeons, and complete hundreds of quests that will offer you to live a real adventure as a main protagonist. You’re here to save the world, after all! Respawn is a lie. When you kill something, you’d better replant it, or you might accidently wipe out an entire species. Our unique ecosystem feature will give you complete control over mobs population. While others offer you houses, we give you worlds! Haven Worlds! Join a guild and acquire your own little piece of the world, to build and develop just as you wish. Don’t worry, in the Haven Worlds there are houses too, and so much more! NPCs are so yesterday… Write your own destiny and join the political dance of your Nation. Become Governor or one of his ministers, and make decisions that will impact thousands of players. The choice is yours: decide if you’d rather be a democratic, peaceful leader, or a tyrannical conqueror!",
