    "About the game": "Wavy Trip is an arcade scoring runner game. You fly along a wavy tunnel avoiding obstacles and without touching walls. Passing through the rings you get points, touching the border of the ring you get one point and passing through its center two points, respectively. Also along the way, you collect coins to buy new skins. In flight, you are constantly pulled down and holding the left mouse button you fly up, so you need to go through the tunnel. Over time, the gameplay speeds up and you have to try not to lose.",
