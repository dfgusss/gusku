    "About the game": "In a world where magic is Queen, people lived happily and safely under the protection of the ten guardian goddesses. Out of the unknown came a powerful demon who brought trouble upon the world, and all the goddesses got captured and locked away. Evil creatures started to take hold of the nearby villages and threatened the inhabitants. Zia is a little girl who lives in a village in the mountains with her parents. When she was younger, she discovered by chance a spell book and started to practice magic. One day, an old wise man came from the mountain and asked Zia's parents for shelter for one night. At the dinner table, he told Zia about the existence of several spell books spread around the world. Zia got very interested and begged her parents to let her go and look for these books to learn more about magic spells. During her journey, Zia will discover the trapped goddesses. Now is your chance to help her rescue the goddesses from the evil creatures by casting magic spells! The battle system uses magical formulas based on symbols that you learn throughout the game, during the battle you must use the arrow keys to replicate the magic spell formula and cast it to hit the enemy. Each enemy type is more sensitive to certain magic than others.",
