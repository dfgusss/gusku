    "About the game": "THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS THIS GAME IS CHALLENGING AND DOES NOT HOLD YOUR HAND AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT IT TO. PAY ATTENTION, PACE YOURSELF, AND TAKE YOUR TIME. THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS. WATCH THE VIDEOS ABOVE, IN GAME, OR JOIN THE DISCORD. THIS GAME DOES NOT SUPPORT KEYBOARD AND MOUSE. IT IS DESIGNED AROUND A GAMEPAD. IN THE MEANTIME YOUR OTHER OPTION IS TO REQUEST A REFUND. I WON’T GET MAD ;) CAPITAL LIST LEADHERBOARDS - The primary goal is to get a high score, however the only way to keep your score is to extract with it. You cannot play till death. If you die, not only do you wipe your current score, you risk the chance of wiping your leaderboard position as well. How you ask? The lower your health the higher the bonus the greater the risk. Every time you extract your score is marked. Why you ask? Why not? SPLIT SCREEN SINGLE PLAYER TWIN STICK RISK ‘EM UP - You will be controlling two ships simultaneously. The devil is in the details. The left side is invincible, however shooting and moving consumes your LINK. In order to restore it you must recover MATERIAL on the right side. MATERIAL multiplies your overall score so use it with absolute discretion. On the right side you are recovering resources and will need 12 PARTS to extract and mark your leaderboard position. Don’t doubt yourself. Push yourself. You will be rewarded and you will be tested. TEARS - Each Tear consists of new challenges with hella bonuses attached to them. Focus, overcome, and survive. If you want a challenge you came to the right place. #arcadeIsNotDead",
