    "Release date": "Apr 3, 2014",
    "About the game": "“I know what you’re thinking: Why keep getting up, day in and day out, even though your life is going nowhere?” Notorious: Widely considered to be one of the bleakest and best-written experiences in indie gaming, Actual Sunlight challenges you to confront the life of Evan Winter: An overweight, lonely and severely depressed young professional. Fear the words, not the reading: Presented almost entirely in text, a mixture of sharp observation and pitch black humor captures your interest from provocative beginning to shattering conclusion. Prepare yourself: Actual Sunlight is a uniquely unforgettable adventure that will etch itself into you as one of the most difficult, haunting and beautiful experiences you have ever had as a gamer. Key Features An intense, heartbreaking story with themes of video game addiction, unsatisfying work and miserable solitude. Beautiful, original pixel and CG artwork invokes the streets, offices and sanctuaries of Toronto, Canada. Dark and moody original music sets a proper tone for the brutal indifference of real life. Important Notice Due to explicit language, Actual Sunlight is not appropriate for players under the age of 18. It also deals with extremely mature themes, including depression and thoughts of suicide. Similar to other forms of art that tackle these issues, Actual Sunlight can be an extremely powerful emotional experience – before downloading it, please first consider what your reaction to a book, film or piece of music in a similar vein might be.
