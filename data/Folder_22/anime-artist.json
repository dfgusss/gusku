    "About the game": "Ready to become an Anime Artist? Have you ever tried drawing those sexy anime characters? Now you can! Anime Artist lets you Sketch, Color and Collect anime artworks. Practice makes perfect! This is your ultimate chance to become an Anime Master. Coloring is the part that brings your art to life. But remember, make sure to choose the correct colors and of course to use them in the right spots, or you'll risk running out of time! Your art is ready, and your model girl is absolutely stunning! However, while her clothes are really nice, what if there were... fewer of them? After coloring the picture, you'll be able to check out a more spicy version of your art. Awesome! (Free 18+ DLC required). Of course, things are going to be challenging sometimes. You'll need to draw and color enough of the artwork, or the next stage will not unlock. Moreover, some pictures will be harder than others, and there will be three degrees of success for each one. For those who will find the challenge too tough, there will be two different ways to get help during the game. Can you successfully draw all the artworks in the game? How fast can you do it? Complete the collection and fill up your gallery! We plan to continually add artworks to the game, both free and via DLCs, in order to give you the best value over time possible! As our ultimate goal we will be adding mod support to our game! Imagine uploading your own art and sharing it with your friends; sounds good right?",
