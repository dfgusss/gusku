    "About the game": "Apocalypse: 2.0 Edition is an extremely fast paced shooter, which mixes several modern game mechanics into the classic zombie survival experience. This includes an economy; item looting; item management; character quests; character stats; attachments; and much more! Every feature from the original game has been completely re-done from scratch in UE4, and with over 17 content updates there's plenty of content to keep you going. Including 9 maps (5 variants each); 3 missions; multiplayer (optional); performance mode (120+ FPS @ Recommended); and an economy. There's also all the latest tech integrated, including DirectX12; Vulkan; and more. With an upcoming Soundtrack created by Jak (Link Below). Many thanks for checking out apocalypse's Steam page, don't forget to have a look at my twitter account, my news feed, or the community hub for development updates. Disclaimer, there's currently no costs in this title and it won't change, this means no micro-transactions; no one-time fees; no subscriptions; etc. I purely run this project as a hobby :) Soundtrack Producer -",
