With access to this device, get ready to make decisions in the president's place. But be careful with the device, since your decisions can have consequences! You always have to balance the favour of the people and the elites likewise. You also have to balance your budget, your debt, your gold and more.

Ministers, activists, lobbyists, your neighbours, the deep state, contract killers and even gold-loving aliens. But at the end of the day, you make the decisions. Most of the time at least. About the game: This is a decision-based resource management game. Balance your resources and be aware of the sentiment in the population. Get more and more power to unlock more individuals, making it more and more complex as you play. Just like in the real alternative life.",
