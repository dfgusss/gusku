    "About the game": "When I wake up, a dark and eerie shape towers over me...standing still... and it moans, “Black Shadows are watching you”, before suddenly evaporating into nothingness... BlackShadows is a survival horror game. You'll assume the role of a young scientist who is fighting against her most terrifying nightmare. Explore creepy rooms, keep your cool in the strangest of atmospheres, and make sure to find all the keys if you want to escape before it's too late! Are you brave enough to venture further? This is your one warning: Stay away from Black Shadows... ' Super game! I love the atmosphere! First game I’ve rated a 5. Great Job 😀 ' From Karakins Games on Gamejolt ' Awesome game! the atmosphere is really amazing! 😀 5/5 Great job! ' From Poweryan on Gamejolt ' This is a pretty fun horror game. Batteries are key because if you run out of light you are totally boned! It adds to the tension that the flashlight dies so fast. You just have to run headlong into each and every terrifying hallway because hesitation means less flashlight power. It's well worth the $3 ' From Evilpeopleinc on Desura ' Game looks amazing! The atmosphere is tense...I like it. Can't wait!. ' From CrazyCahill on Steam Greenlight In order to run properly the game, you'll need : DirectX 9.0 or later : -us/download/details.aspx?id=35 Microsoft Redristibuable C++ 2010 or later : -us/download/details.aspx?id=5555",
