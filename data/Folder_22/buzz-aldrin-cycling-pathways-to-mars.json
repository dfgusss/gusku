    "About the game": "Buzz Aldrin wants to be remembered for more than just 'kicking up moon dust.' He wants his legacy to include laying the groundwork for a permanent human settlement on Mars, and he has a plan. As NASA prepares to send the first humans to Mars, 8i and Time Inc's LIFE VR have collaborated with the celebrated astronaut and historical icon to create a one of a kind virtual reality experience. In the world’s first holographic legacy VR project, created by 8i, viewers will have a unique opportunity to ‘meet’ the astronaut through his hologram today, and future generations will be able to experience Aldrin's legacy, long after mankind has made the journey to Mars. Dr. Aldrin is an American astronaut best known for piloting the Lunar Module on the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, and one of the first men to set foot on the moon. While it was a historic achievement, he wants his legacy to include laying the groundwork for a permanent human settlement on Mars, and he has a plan. In Buzz Aldrin: Cycling Pathways to Mars, journey with Dr. Aldrin from his landing site on the moon to Mars as shows you first hand his plan for inhabiting the Red Planet. To create the hologram, Aldrin was recorded by 8i using volumetric capture and proprietary technology that brings photorealistic holograms of humans into virtual, augmented, and mixed reality in an easy and scalable way. The environment was created by 8i in collaboration with Loot and with stunning visual effects from FuseFX, and is appropriate for all ages. It was produced by 8i in partnership with Soylent.",
