    "About the game": "CLT is an art-house tarot card game about the idea of female sexuality. Its gameplay is centered on a tarot deck of 24 rorschach-esque cards. Every card’s design was hand-painted. The cards are linked to each other, and function like a maze of interconnected memories. The goal is reaching a non-existent 25th card, which symbolizes reaching a sexual climax, thereby ending the level. The game is intended to be non-erotic. The Rorschach motif is not a coincidence: like its trailer (which contains no explicit sexual content) the game contains nothing but abstract imagery and soundscapes. It also contains no actual readable text (formally, that is). This was done as a protest against the idea that games are meant to be nothing more than infantilized escapism: any distribution platform that chooses to censor the game because of its adult content does so in bad faith, as it doesn’t really exist outside of the eye of the beholder.",
