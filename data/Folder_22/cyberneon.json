    "About the game": "This game takes the classic match-three concept for a spin. Each matched tile will paint the board with player’s color. Whoever paints a majority of the board as first wins. Two players can battle each other but also one player can play with an AI opponent. The game features a cyberpunk-inspired futuristic setting with 3D graphics, 5 distinct locations, 3 difficulty levels and 3 different game modes ranging from tactical turn-based to hectic real-time gameplay. You and your opponent can make moves at the same time. Will you be faster, or will you yield in defeat. Every turn, you have a limited time, but you can make as many moves as you want. Every turn, you can only make one move so think deeply to gain maximum possible advantage. Be careful though, because the time limit exists! Combo make you win faster. Use special ability to make a difference.",
