The sheriff and his assistants drove out to investigate the scene, but managed to only report themselves being attacked by a group of people who had went insane. He asked for reinforcements before the connection with him was lost. You are an ardent gunsmith who just loves some good shooting. By the whims of fate, you are presented with an opportunity to help your hometown deal with uninvited guests, all while doing the thing you enjoy the most. Complete “adventure” and “survival” modes with the help of different kinds of weapons. Fists, cold steel, three types of firearms and explosions are at your disposal. In addition you can shoot having guns two hands at once. Climb ropes and slide down the cableway. Wipe out zombies and other monsters by knocking them out, mutilating different parts of their bodies, but be careful, they change their behavior depending on your actions. Hone your skills with different weapons at the shooting range. Collect the artifacts in different rooms in the abandoned house and place them in the right place, while keeping your eyes peeled for prowling hordes of uninvited guests. Find an underground passage in the cellar, clear it from a host of abominations and slay the Spider boss to get outside. At the factory, you will have to find a canister, fill it with fuel from a reservoir, while fending off zombie attacks, and then refuel the car to continue your adventure in the forest. Traverse the wood through the hills and marshes to discover a plane crash site with weapons and try to survive to get to the final showdown. During the finale stage in the abandoned house, you need to survive six waves of zombies, monsters and boss fighting with the help of all possible weaponry and unlimited ammo..",
