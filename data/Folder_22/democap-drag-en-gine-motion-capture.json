    "About the game": "DEMoCap allows to do Motion Capture using VR equipment for example for Game Development. There are various advantages to this technique compared to other MoCap techniques: Less expensive equipment Quick to equip actor for performing. Does not require large rooms build especially for MoCap. Allows actors to see the scene in which they have to perform. Capture motion in real time without post processing. Capture any count of characters and interactions between them no matter doing motion capture as single person or a group. Easily re-take captures of individual characters without re-taking all. Allows capturing complex characters (body, tails, wings, additional arms, u.s.f.) DEMoCap is build using the Drag[en]gine Game Engine. The resulting captured animations are usable directly in the Drag[en]gine Game Engine or can be imported into Blender3D for editing. Using Blender the captured animations can be used for everything Blender3D can be used for. DEMoCap uses the original armature/skeleton without modification. The captured animation is directly usable in-game. Using Motion Transfers DEMoCap supports various kinds of armatures/skeletons. You can capture humanoid characters, beastly characters, tails, wings, extra arms, and more. You can also capture First Person Hands for first person view oriented games. Using VR you can recreate the relevant parts of your game scene. This allows your actor to perform more natural and animations are better fitting to your game scene. Define precisely where your animation origins are located in-game. This ensures captured animations are properly positioned and oriented without the need to post-process them to fit into your game. In short DEMoCap accelerates the animation production allowing for higher quality animations to be done in less time. DEMoCap is Open Source. The GitHub repository link can be found at the home page. To use DEMoCap you need SteamVR and Drag[en]gine version 1.10 or higher. Links to tutorials and documentation can be found at the 'Online Manual' link in information box. (0.x are Early Access versions but already usable for productive use)",
