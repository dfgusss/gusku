    "About the game": "Dreadnought Sol places you in the shoes of a Sol Defense Force Dreadnought fighting for survival against insurmountable odds. Humanity has been flushed out of the known space by alien resistance who opposes humanity's industrialized growth, and it's your job to take it all back. Fight through procedurally generated scenarios from a top down perspective with beautiful 3D graphics. No journey is the same and neither is your way of playing it. Plan ahead, gather supplies and make the best run you can. The campaign starts with the SDFs fleet on it's last legs. Once a sprawling civilization, humanity is now the resistance. Its your job as the last Dreadnought's commander to lead the way back into the Inner Colonies before the time window closes and the fleet is cut off. To fight the alien horde you'll need to use all the weapons at your disposal. Jump galaxy to galaxy, improve your ship and pave the way for the SDF's fleet. Remember time is of the essence. Godspeed commander.",
