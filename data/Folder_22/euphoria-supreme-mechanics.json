    "About the game": "Supreme Mechanics is a first-person puzzle game combining elements of social fiction, detective and horror with deep philosophical insight. The players will have to crack some grim criminal cases by exploring the world around them, rediscover the mysterious identity of the protagonist, cross the borders of inherent dangers and formal logic and create their own vision of time and history. BECOME A MYSTERY HUNTER A true hunter always trusts their gut instincts. They see moments of doubt as a waste of time as the path to the truth lies clear before their mind’s eye. It’s an intricate network of barely visible strings and links between other people’s secrets, mysteries and motives… You just have to pull the right string which will lead you to the solution. Become a hunter whose primary weapons are his mind and heart. COMPOSE YOUR VISION OF THE WORLD FROM BITS OF INFORMATION The main feature of this game is the unusual mix of sci-fi, social fiction, detective and horror. Each genre presents a unique story; the players may freely combine fragments of information from them all to create their own versions of this world, its history and the causes of main events. The identity of the protagonist is a mystery itself, and you’ll have to approach the storyline like a puzzle to solve it. FOLLOW THE STORIES OF THOSE WHO GOT LOST IN THIS LABYRINTH BEFORE Each and every person who had passed through this world before the protagonist came had their own vision of what was going on. Each and every one of them left some clues. The data that you’ll eventually gather might sometimes be inconsistent and controversial, but there will also be similar or even duplicate bits of valuable information. Trying to make any sense out of all this is hard, but the process itself will definitely bring you closer to the truth. CATCH A SOUNDWAVE Your mysterious benefactor created a special mix of background sounds to set the mood for thought. All the mysteries will surely give in if you immerse yourself in the music and let it stimulate your subconscious. Clear your mind of doubts and trust your intuition.",
