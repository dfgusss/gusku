    "About the game": "FriendZoned Archer is an action adventure game inspired by the classic NES Zelda. There is complete freedom of exploration, hidden Areas, hidden dungeons and key items to help you ease through the open world. The combat focuses on shooting and combos and the key items can interact with enemies, world and bosses thus drawing inspirations from the sandbox nature of open world games. You would think that nothing is more sad than the grief of your waifu being kidnapped by monsters and trapped far away inside a dungeon, But, multiply that sadness by 4 and you have the story of our Archer whose all 4 waifus are kidnapped by 4 monsters of the underworld of Albagooniya land. Play the role of a brave Archer who sets afoot in the land of Albagooniya to save his waifus from Monsters, And try to make more waifus there just in case!
