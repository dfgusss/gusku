    "About the game": "Future Pool is a futuristic and dynamic variation of 8-ball pool. Players take turns to fire a glassy cue-ball at a cluster of balls on a circular pool table. The first player to knock out all of their balls plus the black 8-ball is the winner. Play against a choice of computer opponents on a choice of table designs, or play against a friend on your PC. You can also compete in a 6-player tournament, and any player can be human or computer. Control the game using mouse or keyboard or an X-Box style game controller.",
