    "About the game": "A soft gel and a hard tank. Two things combine to make a 'Gel tank'! Jump, shoot, climb walls, and seize boarding weapons. Defeat the swarm of enemies and conquer the stage with simple actions! You can use the jewels you pick up along the way as currency to buy skills in the shop and customize your character! You can collect the captured creature 'Nekodoru Fuin' and combos that go up when you defeat enemies with no damage. Collect achievement badges that can be earned by fulfilling conditions in a stage. You can also collect achievement badges that can be earned by fulfilling conditions in the stage, as well as time attacks that are performed with limited skills. The story is colored by the intercepted enemy communications along the stage path. Experience the seemingly lurid worldview with your own hands! The 16-bit retro-style graphics can be selected from the options screen. You can experience even more nostalgia with a cathode ray tube style filter! You are welcome to make, post, and distribute videos of yourself playing this game, as well as fan art and other fan activities!",
