    "About the game": "A graveyard on the hills - damp, cold and desolate Its namefather lost but not it's nameplate A new resident arrives on shoulders ever so leisurely As father throws ashes to ashes looking kinda weary Last arrival drew the final straw They wanted to rise but didn't know how An underground meeting took place nobody could have known Voices turned to screams as the dead were overflown Dusk got shattered with with raging moans and groans As the cursed graveyard got covered with restless souls They will face a single obstacle to bring on the doom A graveyard keeper sworn to stop them and a magical shroom Info Graveyard Shift is a FPS with unique game mechanics and a mise-en-scène that mixes both toonish and horror elements together! Yes, we did it. You are fighting against restless ghosts and liches. They revolt, because too many graves are dug in the graveyard, whose keeper is you. Your purpose is to re-kill the undead! Your only friends are mushrooms, those you use to make mushroom bombs. Gameplay Your ammo is elemental mushrooms, there are 5 different elements of mushrooms those you collect from the ground. You create bombs with those elemental mushrooms (2 Fire, 1 Water, for example) using number keys 1 to 5. Your enemies also have elements; enemy’s element and the elements of your mushroom-bomb determine the damage you deal. For example, you deal more damage to a Fire ghost if you prepare a bomb with Water mushrooms. There are 2 types of enemies: Normal ghosts and liches. Normal ghosts are melee attackers, they use claws. Whereas, liches throw you stones and they are much stronger than normal ghosts. We have 2 game modes: Waved and Survival. You fight against 10 waves of enemies in the first. Survival lasts as long as you are alive. There are 4 power-ups: Slow Time, Shield, Mushroom Magnet and Infinite Mushrooms.",
