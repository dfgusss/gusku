    "Name": "Haunted Gas Station",
    "Release date": "Oct 16, 2019",
    "About the game": "After a vehicle accident, a man is forced to check a nearby gas station for help, unaware of its ghastly resident. FPS Indie Horror where you use your phone's flashlight to help navigate the property, look for a key and interacting with the environment while trying to find a way to get back on the road. Just a classic low-quality indie horror game for a throwback to the earlier days of cheap games. Think of this as playing out a short creepypasta.",
