    "About the game": "You are embarking on a fresh start. It is your first day of work as a housekeeper at one of the most luxurious apartment buildings in the city. However, before you can power up the vacuum cleaner for the first time, a mysterious person informs you that you will be making a lot more money than you were originally contracted, but instead of cleaning apartments, you will be demolishing them. At first, you hesitate, but then you realize how this much money can change your life. Housekeeping VR is a Virtual Reality game for the Vive and Rift. It is a race against the clock as you completely destroy luxurious apartments in an attempt to locate hidden information and objects for your boss. Throughout the game, you will amass an arsenal of tools and weapons to help make your job easier. If this job does not seem odd enough, you will quickly begin to realize that something in this world is not right, and the search for the truth about your mysterious boss, and the company he represents will consume you.
