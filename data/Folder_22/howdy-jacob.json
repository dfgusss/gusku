    "About the game": "A dystopian 'find the hidden pictures' game with full-motion video of puppets, and you are right in the mix of it all! You play Chandler, the showrunner for the state's most popular propaganda TV show: Laughsail! You and your puppet co-stars have been called in on a Saturday because the show has killed off another cabin boy, and you need to make sure the training program for the new actor is up to scratch. You'll deal with egos, confusion, and some tired friends, but you're used to it. And besides...anything for the state.",
