Journalists, other politicians and leaders, justices, even common voters, they will all react to the situation.

What will you choose – peace or war? Make no mistake, the fate of the world rests on your shoulders. How should you respond – jokingly, seriously or ironically? Different options can help you make allies, but also enrage your previous supporters. Be careful with words and make sure that you don’t neglect any of the prominent groups or important people… or do and deal with the problems later. Follow the narrative and react to events. Talk to your advisors, receive visitors and make decisions. There are no wrong answers... unless there are?

An excellent entry in social media can be the key to a great popularity among the public or a nail in the coffin for a careless person. Your actions have impact on the world and even the most innocent post can ruin someone’s career! Use the most well-known social media platform - Screecher. Screech about your plans, attitude, call somebody names or maybe praise the voters. It is entirely up to you how you want to come across in the internet – as funny, empathetic, factual or maybe weird? Being the president you have a will and a power to create your own image and write schreeches to your liking. But remember - there are always going to be responses from other users. Prepare for a public backlash! Touch people’s hearts with your writing abilities. Create the most compelling speeches and statements to achieve your goals. Want to calm the enraged voters? Show the party that you’re the most efficient president? Raise everyone’s spirit with a resignation speech? All of these can be done with a proper composition. Receive the title of the most charismatic leader ever!... ...or fail and make things even worse by being tactless. But hey, at least you had some fun writing about that salad you’d eaten in the Supreme Court! No teddy bears allowed. Everyone must stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. You cannot say a bad word about president. See? This is the real power. Create executive orders that will change people’s lives. Throw your weight around when it comes to guaranteeing the rigid rules or put the freedom of the Americans first. Reject the acts that don’t appeal to you and check what will happen then. Outline new borders of democracy with your abilities, but remember – no one is untouchable. YOUR REGIME STARTS NOW",
