    "About the game": "InfinitasDM - Create, Organize, and Play Campaigns for Pen and Paper RPGs. InfinitasDM is an Atlas, Lorebook, Battle Map, digital RPG tabletop all in one. All completely game-system agnostic for any genre and any RPG system. Unlike other 'digital tabletops,' InfinitasDM takes the power of digital tools and brings them to the physical table. Create and control your campaign from your PC/Mac while sending an additional Player's View to a secondary display. For even more immersion mount or project the Player's View display onto your gaming table and use physical miniatures and set pieces to enhance your gaming experience. In addition to creating and playing content from your Windows or MacOS computers, campaign files are also compatible across the iOS and Android versions of the app. This allows GM / DMs to use tools like: Digital Maps (Import existing maps or create them from scratch within InfinitasDM) Fog of War Documents (writing, viewing, and organization) Player tokens Map Links that connect directly to documents and other maps, and more All without forcing everyone to play from individual computers over the internet.",
