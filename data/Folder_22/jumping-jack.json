    "About the game": "Originally released in 1983, this classic arcade-style platformer for the ZX Spectrum from British developers Imagine gave players the thrill of 20 increasingly-challenging levels. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Gameplay To complete each level, Jack must jump up through the gaps in the 8 layers. Gaps appear at random, and move across the screen, so you must time your jumps carefully. Later levels introduce more and more zany hazards to dodge. You'll soon see how addictive and challenging this can be. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
