You’d do anything not to become the cuisine du jour, Feline Nigiri. But it’s not about you. It’s about saving thousands of other hastily evolved cats, enslaved in gladiatorial games aboard the 1950’s leisure cruiser, the Starliner Fairbrother, a generation ship overdue for the promised land of Alpha Centauri. More importantly, it’s about saving the one you love, LeChat, held hostage to rein in your rebellious tendencies. Today is the day Kitty steps up, the day Kitty flips the script, the day Kitty rises as a champion, a hero, and a savior. Kitty nigiri is a VR Danger room puzzler that challenges your wits and dexterity in its trials. Hours of training that will stretch your mind, tickle your senses and get your heart racing. You play as kitty the engineered hybrid cat thrown into a life or death battle of will and cunning. Each trial demands more and more of kitty, lasers, deadly obstacles all work to turn kitty into what the audience really wants. But kitty isn't in this just to survive, a resistance is brewing. With your trusty chopsticks at your side, you will teleport, surf and maneuver your way to chase sushi, dodge lasers, solve puzzles and save kittens. Be the cat, chase the sushi, save the kittens.",
