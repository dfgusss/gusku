Well designed skills and spells: Fighters own a variety of martial arts movements, not only basic attacks. All of the arcane spells and divine spells of caster classes are greatly improved, too. About graphics similarity with another game ToME4: We purchased and used a tileset of monsters/items from the Norwegian artist Raymond E. Gaustadnes (Shockbolt). He made another tileset for ToME4. So, both tilesets share the similar style and a few same tiles. Thanks to the Open Gaming License (OGL) from Wizards of the Coast : It has been stated explicitly by Wizards of the Coast that anyone can make a computer game using the open game content under the terms of the OGL. The OGL can be found in the OGL section of their official website, or the in-game Wiki system. In order to apply a set of rules designed for a pen-and-paper game to a computer game, many rules in the OGL had been adjusted or improved.",
