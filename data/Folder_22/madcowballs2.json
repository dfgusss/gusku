A filter are applied depending on how many levels you have finished in that game. Next the 145 different kinds of bricks are speard out over the grid. The upgrades As you finish a level you will gain a skillpoint that can be used to unlock power ups and upgrades. Unlocking a different kind of ball will make it possible for that specific power up to spawn when a brick is destroyed. For each 10.000 points earned in a single level there will be a bonus skillpoint (Get the multi bonuses). Playing the game on a high difficulty will also add skillpoints before the first level. With no upgrades the game works nearly as old classics but it can easily be changed by the player with the upgrades. This may change the game from casual to more of a action shooter. Cow progress Spin the ball, collect multi bonuses, destroy robots and complete other tasks to unlock all 8 difficulty levels and secret option menus.",
