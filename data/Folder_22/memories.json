When their apartment is destroyed in the fallout of a bombing and her daughter becomes fatally injured, Ess struggles with dwindling options as her daughter draws closer to death. After discovering a strange, underground world beneath the city of Beirut, help Ess explore it's secrets as she tries to find a way to save her daughter amidst the growing chaos.
