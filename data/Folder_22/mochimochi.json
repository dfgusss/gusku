    "About the game": "Help Suama stretch and zoom through four bite sized dreamy dessert inspired worlds in an effort to finally reunite with her love Mochi! With a simple one button control scheme Mochi Mochi provides a relaxed but ever-increasing level of challenge throughout its short and welcoming 2D adventure. Go and get those kisses! Features 20 levels gradually unlocked through collectables, allowing players to tackle level order according to their own preference. Levels center on swinging Suama to Mochi while making sure to avoid smacking into the celling, hitting yourself on the floor, or slamming paw first into any other dangerous obstacles trying to stop you from your kiss.",
