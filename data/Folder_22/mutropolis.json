The pyramids, the Mona Lisa, The Fresh Prince of Bel Air – forgotten. Forgotten by everyone except Henry Dijon and his ragtag team of archaeologists. They left Mars to dig up lost treasures on the wild and inhospitable Planet Earth. Life is sweet, until Henry’s professor is kidnapped, and thing start to get... weird. Join Henry on a freewheeling adventure through the ruins of our civilization. Ask questions like, “Who was this Sony Walkman? And where did he walk?” Unearth extraordinary relics, rescue Professor Totel, and be the first to enter the legendary city of Mutropolis.
