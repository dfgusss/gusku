    "About the game": "NEMESIS DISTRESS is a unique multiplayer Sci-Fi horror experience that aims at creating unforgettable, cinematic moments. Remember – this is NOT a shooter, in Nemesis you are not the hunter. You are the PREY. What you can hope to achieve is to survive and complete your secret objective as well as main mission. But beware – in multiplayer experience you are not playing a full co-op. Any other player MIGHT be a traitor and will aim at sabotaging you. Sneak your way around the ship, find useful items, take advantage of the noise mechanic and all the tricks around the ship. NEMESIS DISTRESS comes out in Early Access 15th of June and as all our games, will be developed together with a community. Wishlist now and don’t miss the launch! Key Features: True Horror experience We wanted to craft a really thrilling environment, where every sound and movement around the ship will get you on the edge of your sit. There are different types of enemies, with the most dangerous Adult, that can one-shot you. Unique semi co-op You will need to find a fine balance between collaborating with your team-mates (as otherwise you will not survive) and not trusting them fully, as some of them might have some nasty secret objectives. This creates an interesting dynamic and add a bit of extra layer on the horror experience. Noise management Since the alien species on the ship is blind, you will need to be very careful about the sound that you make. But you can also use it to your advantage - throw items to distract enemies and sneak past them… … or just use flamethrower to scare them away. Fresh items idea Since Nemesis is not a shooter, don’t expect too many weapons. Instead, you will have a different “arsenal” – noise detector, hacking tool or good-old pipe will come in handy in various situations.",
