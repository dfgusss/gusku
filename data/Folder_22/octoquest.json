    "About the game": "The year is 3045. Humanity has long since collapsed due to rising sea levels, and now octopuses rule the open seas. Life was simple for a sentient Cephalopod like yourself until you stumbled upon a mysterious mushroom growing in a nearby cave. Now there is a voice inside your head beckoning you to find and consume more of these magical mushrooms. Experience a cerebral journey through the ruins of mankind set to a bass-friendly soundtrack with musical contributions from Emancipator, Caerus, AB200, Kept Blue and Ceratops of Your Infamous Harp. There are 12 caves scattered across the land, each posing a unique challenge. You'll need to encounter at least 8 of them in any order to win the game. Easy to play! Explore a familiar game world inspired by your favorite retro games. Find and collect mushrooms and other resources to level up your natural abilities. Learn to shoot ink, regenerate health, stun your foes, and much more. Just be careful out there and make sure you get plenty of rest: if you have a panic attack, you'll wake up where you last slept.",
