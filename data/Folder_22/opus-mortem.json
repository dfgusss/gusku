    "About the game": "In Opus Mortem you will play the role of Death. Test your reflexes while trying to redirect souls to their respective destinations. Don't worry if it's a bit hard at the beginning, every work gets easier with time and experience! Use the souls you harvest to buy powerful upgrades that will make your job easier. Being the Grim Reaper was never so fun! Between sessions of work you will be able to read the cruel forms in which the last human died. Be sure to read them all, many of them will surprise you and make you feel shivers. Use the keyboard or mouse to redirect the souls to their respective destinations. W, left click or up arrow for good souls. S, right click or down arrow for bad souls. Neutral souls must go to Limbo so you have to let them pass.",
