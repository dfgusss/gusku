    "About the game": "As the city burns and the countryside is engulfed by the epidemic, the living are increasingly alone and forced to live with this new reality. Monstrous beasts and disfigured remnants roam freely with their numbers increasing rapidly, slaughtering everything in their path. In the opening chapter, Lydia finds herself separated from her fellow survivors and all alone. After fleeing into a large manor estate to escape the relentless horde, her only goal now is survival. She must explore the manor, locate supplies and find a way to wake from this nightmare. But somehow... she knows her fate is already sealed. Outbreak: The Nightmare Chronicles is an episodic unforgiving survival horror experience that takes place within the Outbreak universe. Death lurks behind each door as you fight to survive with the limited supplies at your disposal. Search rooms thoroughly and make the right choice when to fight - or flee - from the monstrosities. Featuring classic hardcore survival horror gameplay in a directed single-player experience, you'll need to stay on your toes to stay alive. You have a limited inventory and you'll need to leverage supply caches to store your equipment for use later. Saving your game is also highly restrictive and you'll need to locate the means to record your progress as you explore.

Story Mode: Survive through a classic single-player survival horror experience. Battle Mode: Tough as nails action mode where you scrounge and fight to reach the exit. Cinematic: Experience your last moments through fixed cameras and beautiful environments. Explore: Search rooms and read logs to find keys and solve puzzles to survive. Fight or Flee: Engage threats directly or run away to safety in another room. Classic: True hardcore classic survival horror with a limited inventory and deadly foes. Progress: Saving is limited and restricted. Find floppy disks to record your progress. Storage: Manage your limited inventory by finding and storing items in caches. Difficult: Play across multiple difficulty modes, including the one hit kill Nightmares mode. Defense: Utilize numerous firearms and melee weapons against the undead.
