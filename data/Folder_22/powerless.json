    "About the game": "The world was all but destroyed after the walking sickness wrought havoc on mankind. You managed to stave off the worst of the outbreak by quarantining yourself and are now on a mission to purge those infected by the disease. Do you have what it takes to overcome the zombie horde, or will you, too, succumb to it and take solace in the sweet release of death? You have your choice of game play: Survive as long as you can against the zombie horde Neutralize the zombie threat by purging them all Test your skill by defeating wave-after-wave of increasingly deadly zombies Choose your area as well - will you engage zombies in the big city, an arid wasteland, or the remains of a mysterious industrial building? The decision is yours, but each environment brings its own danger with it so pick wisely. Your weapons will be your best friend and your only chance of survival. Take out zombies using your trusty 1911 or shotgun, or amp it up with automatic weapons and your rocket launcher. Don't get too trigger happy, the last thing you'll want to do is run out of ammo...unless you know how to cheat the system. Aside from solid, fun game play, you can also read the e-book! When not immersing yourself in live-action zombie killing, transport yourself into a world filled with danger as you follow a group of college kids through their own waking nightmare. The book is distributed along with the game.",
