    "About the game": "Robot City Stadium is a competitive multiplayer disc-combat sport focused on skill, nuance, and mastery. Competitive: Online multiplayer against friends, enemies, strangers, casual acquaintances, romantic interests, and even people from elementary school who for some reason just sent you a Steam friend request! Natural: You'll jump and dodge, block and throw, score points, and annihilate your friends with the natural effortlessness of 'being there'.  No obscure or uncomfortable teleport mechanics here- RCS was built from the ground up to take full advantage of room-scale VR. Finessed: RCS is a competitive game, so when you throw your weapon it has to go exactly where you expect, just like throwing a frisbee.  That's different than 'goes where you want'- there's no aim-assist here.  The precision of the amazing Vive controllers means that what you throw is what you get.  It's up to you to bring the skill. Nuanced: Twist your wrist as you release a throw to add some spin for curving trick shots.  Collect and expend 'spark energy' to give it an in-flight nudge and edge past a barrier or sneak in a hit out of left field. Varied: A selection of unique arena layouts and features keeps the action fresh and interesting. Not-really-all-that-intimidating: Experienced players are going to beat inexperienced players: that's just the nature of a skill-based game.  Fortunately, we've got friendly AI bots who are happy to train you without the attitudes and platitudes :) :)",
