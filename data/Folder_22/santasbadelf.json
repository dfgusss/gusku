    "About the game": "Help Santa with his Christmas preparations. All the presents are gift wrapped and ready for delivery on Christmas Eve. But one of Santa's elves is being naughty, he’s trying to steal a present for himself. You need to keep watch and tap the screen if you see him escaping with a present. This will warn Santa and the present will be saved. This simple touch game builds into an adrenalin pumping experience as your reactions are tested to the limit. Can you catch the Bad Elf or will you be fooled by the good Elf who dresses so similar? The game speeds up as time passes so you’ll have less time to react. One wrong tap and your score will be depleted by a third! Santa’s Bad Elf is a great game to play while you wait for 25th December to come along. Operation mode: Click the left mouse button holding a gift to escape the elf",
