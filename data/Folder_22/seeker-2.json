    "About the game": "Content: Over 50 levels Test your speed with an all-new timer and challenge your friends to see who is the fastest. Leaderboard system with a weekly refresh Why I made this game: I made this game because I wanted to expand on Seeker my first game released on this platform. I took the base game and expanded it by having more levels but keeping the core gameplay the same. I added new levels for everyone to enjoy and explore. I wanted to see if I could make another great game for everyone to enjoy. What this game expresses: Seeker 2 features a relaxing story where the player can enjoy playing the game without worrying about competition. Seeker 2 is a great singleplayer game where the player can take as much time as possible to explore old and new islands. The Content for Seeker 2 will have more updates than Seeker. I want to keep growing Seeker 2 over time with new levels and a new system that this game hits milestones. This will either be small or large updates. The game is for those who want to relax and enjoy a video game that is easy to pick up and fair. Overview of the game: Seeker 2 like the original Seeker in terms of gameplay value and fun. Seeker 2 is a stress-relieving game where you can play for the story or seek out adventure and discover the map. Seeker is about a stranded alien named Alfie who needs to find five stars to power up the spaceship. Help Alfie find the stars and get back home! The game is set on an island where Alfie is set up for an adventure to gather the stars of power. Alfie is from another solar system and in his solar system, the gravity is much denser than our own. Alfie can use this to fly around the level looking for the stars that are on the ground waiting for him to pick up.",
