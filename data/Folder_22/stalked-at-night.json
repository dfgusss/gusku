Later,you wake up from a car crash,not exactly knowing where you are.Before crashing you saw some big animal crossing the road,and then following you for a while.Right now your priorities are to get out of this place. Features Simple but enjoyable gameplay. Multiple endings. Big enviroment. Tense atmosphere of fear.",
