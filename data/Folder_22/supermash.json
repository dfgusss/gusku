    "About the game": "In SuperMash , you're an independent video game store clerk who's found a special magical game console. It spews out retro games with crazy randomized titles, mashed-up gameplay and objectives, and even authentic bugs - all of which you'll get to play! Including elements of multiple classic game genres, from Action Adventure to JRPG, SHMUP to Classic Platformer, every mashed boot-up is an unexpected surprise! EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED! – Glitches, goals, and obstacles change up the gameplay, so you never know if you're headed to an easy win - or an near impossible challenge! CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMES! – With Dev Cards, you can customize elements of each Mash, like enemies, players, mechanics, and environments. Keep playing to collect them all! THE POSSIBILITIES ARE ENDLESS! – With genres including Platformer, Action Adventure, Shoot ‘Em Up, Metrovania, Stealth, and JRPG, there are all kinds of wacky - sometimes wonderful, sometimes scary - ways that gameplay, bugs and objectives can randomly combine. CHALLENGE YOUR FRIENDS! – Share each Mash’s unique code with a friend or streamer to see if they can succeed where you failed—or impress them by completing their “impossible” Mashes!",
