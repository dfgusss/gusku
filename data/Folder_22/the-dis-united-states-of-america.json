The Dis-United States Of America is a single player card game where you play 1 of 9 Political Factions to control the future direction of the USA. Each Faction has it's own Card Deck which you either play against your opponent's hand or use to gather resources from each US State. Each Card has a specific action when played such as controlling a resource or blocking another Faction in a state. By the end of the game, the Faction controlling the most US States wins the game. The Factions: Celebrities - they gather their adoring fans. Corporations - they turn everything into money. Criminal - they steal from other Factions. Ecologists - they want everyone to Go Green! Government - they try to impose control on other Factions. Liberals - they want everyone to seek peace and love in the world. Nationalionalists - they believe in the Star Spangled Banner and Uncle Sam Religious - they want the country to live by the word of God. Socialists - they want the workers to own the means of production.",
