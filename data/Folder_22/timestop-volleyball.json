    "About the game": "Timestop Volleyball is a casual adult-only sports game. You are competing against world class beach volleyball players on a tropical beach. Normally you wouldn't stand a chance, but luckily you possess a mysterious power to stop time - for everybody else except you. This ability should increase your chances of winning - but what else would you do with such power? ;) This game consists of volleyball matches with varying difficulties, and cutscenes in between levels. Your progress is saved as you unlock new content, so you can replay previous levels and cutscenes any time later. Controls: Move - WASD Vertical Jump - Space",
