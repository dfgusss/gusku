    "About the game": "Tiny Bunny Is A Non-linear Horror Visual Novel. We're planning to release the game as 5 episodes ; Three of them are already out for you to enjoy. Everything falls into slumber when winter comes, but not this forest. There's something wandering its snow-covered paths, lurking behind black trees and taking whatever it considers due. It leaves behind bizarre rumors of voices, calling you into the thicket, of faces, looking into your windows, of mysterious prints in the snow and... a bunch of 'child missing' posters. Those, who have heard the voice of the forest, are beyond help. Their only option is to sink deeper and deeper into the cold embrace of horror to face their final choice in that icy darkness: to stay alive or to stay human? The story takes place in a quiet, unremarkable village lost among the Siberian forest. The protagonist, Anton, had recently moved there with his family and was almost immediately forced to witness and participate in a chain of unsettling events. It's a place where children go missing. The police are powerless, search teams are combing out the forest, but they find no traces. Why, then, is Anton repeatedly coming across prints, bloodstains, and scraps of clothing? It almost feels like someone is putting up a show just for him. He is haunted by nightmares at first, which grow more and more frightening and bloody every night. They also grow increasingly real ... and beckoning. ✔ A fascinating horror story that will remain in your memory for a long time. ✔ Every choice you make affects the story. ✔ Stylish graphics made in black&amp; white. ✔ Original scary soundtrack will pierce you to the bones. ✔ Disturbing, oppressive atmosphere. ✔ Horrifying secrets. Warning! This game contains offensive language and scenes of physical and psychological violence. Proceed with caution!",
