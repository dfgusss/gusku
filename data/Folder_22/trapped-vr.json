    "About the game": "Kidnapped by a mysterious figure, It's up to you to solve the puzzles around you to escape your containment. Trapped VR is a VR puzzle game that focuses on how the player interacts with the game world. To win you must solve the puzzles surrounding you to figure out the secret code that unlocks the container doors. This game is a test of my skills in developing a VR project, so it isn't a fully completed game but it has enough gameplay included to still be fun!",
