    "About the game": "Vektor Z brings fast and furious retro space blasting action to Steam! Blast your way through endless waves of asteroids and enemies to write your name among the stars for all to see! Vektor Z offers both relentless action and vibrant visuals that is certain to have you playing again and again! More than just blasting asteroids: You'll travel through seven different sectors of the Vektor Z galaxy, each presenting its own unique challenges. Learning how to succeed in each sector as you progress through the levels is half of the fun! Each sector will give you tips on the basics before you spawn your ship there! Along the way, you'll come across golden stars that can be collected and either saved for later upgrades or used near the end of your game to buy extra ships! Should you run out of ships at the end of your game, and you have accumulated enough Valor Starz, you'll be offered an option to use some to buy another life. But decide carefully, because any Valor Starz you keep will always be saved when you exit the game and can be used to buy upgrades that will save permanently to aid you in your future games! Valor Starz can also be used before or after each game to buy new colors and ship designs to get your preferred 'cooler' look so you can play in style! Original, exhilarating music along with unique custom drawn art make Vektor Z an unforgettable gaming experience for both old school and new gamers alike! --------------------------- IMPORTANT NOTE: This game is NOT a 'twin stick shooter' and has controls seen below. If you play this game expecting twin stick shooter controls, you're likely to be disappointed. --------------------------- KEYBOARD CONTROLS: W key: Thrusts you forward in the direction you currently face A &amp; D keys: Rotate your ship Left and Right respectively LEFT MOUSE BUTTON: Shoots, Hold down or mash repeatedly to fire faster shots RIGHT MOUSE BUTTON: Hyperspace gets you out of harms way and teleports you to a random location on the screen (No protection vs landing on an asteroid)",
