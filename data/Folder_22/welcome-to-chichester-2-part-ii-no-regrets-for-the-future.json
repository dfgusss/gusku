    "About the game": "About This Game This visual novel continues from where Welcome To... Chichester 2 - Part I left off, but you don't need to have played the previous version in order to follow the story - a recap is available if needed The Story Taking place on the second day of the protagonist's holiday, who wakes up with a nasty headache, which is not helped by the presence of the protagonist's 'nemesis' - the megalomaniacal, kleptomaniac and cake mix loving Grendel Jinx. Whilst waiting for breakfast to be served, talk to turns to how you both met and eventually the conversation veers into a period where your budding 'friendship' was nearly permanently severed. Suffering a string of defeats by Grendel, following by an unauthorised beating by her bodyguards, the protagonist's time is spent in the local hospital wondering what went wrong. Eventually coming to a very undesirable conclusion, the protagonist's secretary is tasked with finding out whether the protagonists' supposition is correct or not. Meanwhile, Grendel gets news that her bodyguards have been killed, and with all evidence pointing to the protagonist, she sets out for revenge.
