    "About the game": "Xpraize Beta, the first game developed by the indie game company RedefineArts Inc., is an innovative game that allows you to play a tabletop role-playing game in VR. The game is available in PC and VR versions, and in this VR version, you are the Player. Player, embark on an adventurous journey in a world where the Game Master, a participant from the PC version, has become the director. You can perform realistic magic chanting using the voice recognition system, attack with weapons, and perform any other free actions. You will indeed feel the possibility of a new type of game. The distributed scenarios are online multiplayer for up to 5 players (4 players and one game master). All players except the game master participate via VR. We are including an introductory fantasy scenario called “Dragon Descendants.” We hope you will experience the fun of Xpraize through this scenario first. The additional scenarios will be updated regularly after the game’s release and distributed as DLC. The “Game Master” version is offered free of charge, so you can discuss it with your friends and decide who will be the Game Master before you start playing. Or you can go into a game and find a Game Master looking for players to play together. 'Xpraize Beta for GameMaster' /",
