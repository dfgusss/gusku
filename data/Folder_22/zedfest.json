    "About the game": "Welcome to Zedfest, the goriest game show ever created! Up to 4 Players work together to complete objectives while killing Zeds with lots and lots of visceral gore. The Zeds are mentally defective creatures created by worthless biologists, built with an A.I that´s even more shitty and designed by underqualified engineers. Some DNA used was taken from animals such as pigs and horses for that extra enjoyable meaty experience. They have the sole purpose of trying to stop the contestant from completing their objectives and die for entertainment. Making them the perfect material for the show. SINGLEPLAYER OR MULTIPLAYER - No friends? No problem. You can play just as fine by yourself. But you sure will have a lot more fun if you had friends. ONLINE LEADERBOARD - Compete with players from around the globe! Statistics such as current wave, difficulty, zed-kills and total Score gets uploaded along with your Steam Username. CLASS AND CHARACTER SELECTION - Choose between 5 classes! They all have different attributes and weapon-loadouts. More than 30 weapons, grenades and equipment pieces are available at Early Access release! GAME MODES - Lure Zeds into the Shredding Machine and watch their bodyparts fly all over the place, Escort and defend Lennart while he's doing something important or collect and destroy the Snus virus in Objective Mode Or Hunt zeds in classic Horde Mode! Invite your friends and try to reach as far as possible! PERSISTENT BLOOD - Shoot the limbs off the zeds and watch the Blood squirt all over the place! The blood persists throughout the game and will never disappear. PERK CONFIGURATION - Different perks for different play styles. Do you want to be a Narcissistic Doctor and go with a self defense build, or help out your teammates by going for a multipurpose 'janitor' build? ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - Powerful Zeds with different melee and ranged attacks. They may work as a group so be careful, or not.",
