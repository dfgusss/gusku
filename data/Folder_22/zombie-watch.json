    "About the game": "Welcome to the world of Zombie Watch! You are one of a few people who survived a virus that has infected most of the population and turned them into flesh-eating zombies. They may be dead but they are not resting in peace and they will come after you. Take on the challenge of survival in a harsh and brutal environment and prove you can conquer them all. Zombie Watch is a top-down, open-world survival game that will take you to the post-apocalyptic world, where you are going to encounter many zombies and wildlife. Gather, mine, scavenge for resources and build a self-sustaining base with defenses to fend off the incoming zombie hordes. Craft or find weapons, armor, medicine, and much more. STORY You wake up in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by bloodthirsty zombies that are after you around the clock. They can smell you from the distance, hear every step you take if you are not careful, and will make you their one and only target once they spot you. While living in hiding or fighting for your life, you also have to attend to your basic human needs. It would be a shame if you perished from starvation or cold.
