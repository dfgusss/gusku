    "About the game": "You are the main character who, by a tragic coincidence, died in a car accident and now his soul wanders through Purgatory. Until one day he is not given a job: to find other souls who will sign a petition to be sent to Hell. The hero happily accepts the position, as the reward will be the opportunity to move beyond this forgotten place, or at least make it more spacious, since Purgatory has long been overcrowded. AfterLife Work is a 3d arcade game with a first-person view, a time runner where you run around the Purgatory location and have dialogues with the souls of the dead, asking them to sign your petition. Someone refuses, hoping for ascension and forgiveness, and someone agrees, out of boredom, indifference or humility. But do not forget: your time is limited and therefore you cannot talk in vain with wandering souls. Game Features: - 3d pixel art - Atmosphere - Music",
