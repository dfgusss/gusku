    "About the game": "A new type of tactical RPG title that flips the script! Slimes, the weakest of RPG enemies, have the ability to take over enemy units and fight! [Summary] This is a strategic turn-based RPG, but it is Slimes that you control. Slimes can take over an enemy and control them in battle. For example, a Slime can utilise archers, or use magic if they take over a magician. They can even bewilder an enemy with a bribe if they take over a merchant. In addition there are various kinds of Slimes: Some of them can warp. Some of them can improve the abilities of the possessed enemy. And many more... Each stage poses key strategic questions. Which Slime will you use on each enemy? How will you take them over? For example the element of a Slime is very important for a capture. This is a tough game, too, so you cannot win by charging in recklessly - tactics are vital. The appearance of this game may be lighthearted, but a big challenge awaits! [STORY] The world was about to be ruined. The brutal humans arrived and almost took over the whole world. They burnt the forest, polluting the water and the sky. They were tyrannical, almost ruining the land. And they threatened the Slimes that offered little resistance; they did not have great power and merely waited for extinction. Then the Slimes realised they could take over the human bodies and use that strength against their enemies. The Slime counterattack began.",
