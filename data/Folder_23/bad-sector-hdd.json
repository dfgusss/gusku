    "About the game": "Bad Sector is a game about immunizing a data storage device while a virus works against you. The virus' abilities expand as you progress, from blindly hopping between nodes to actively following and interfering with your immunization attempts. On top of that, you're working against the clock to reach a minimum immunization percentage before each round ends. Bad Sector: High-Density Disk Edition introduces collectible power-ups, tougher enemies and an endless survival game mode.",
