    "About the game": "$3500 High Score Tournament &amp; (CLAIMED)$5000 BOUNTY! (STARTS FEBRUARY 25TH, 2021) Be the first to the kill screen, or be one of the top 10 scores standing by September 5th, to win a cash prize! More details at ! JOIN THE CASTLE KONG DISCORD!! WATCH TWITCH STREAMS! Castle Kong is Drowning Monkeys homage to what we consider the best game ever made: Galaga. Anyways... What makes the golden age of arcade gaming so fun is a simple concept: 1 coin (Meaning no restarts or additional lives. there are no actual coins on the PC version of the game), 3 lives. play till you die or hit the kill screen, and set a high score. And that's what Castle Kong is all about. Just like the game it's based on (Probably not Galaga), CK will be a ruthless, 4 stage, 22 level romp as you play PauperBoy, a young kid who sets out to save PrincessGirl from the evil clutches of BaronMan. Unlike it's predecessors, we leverage the power of connectivity to host tournaments (with a championship!), verify high scores, and have a global leaderboard. And As Always, if anyone's interested, a kill screen is coming up.",
