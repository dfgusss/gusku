Full-body tracking is not required, VR is not required. You can find more detailed information on what custom avatars can contain and what the requirements are in our documentation. Worlds You are enabled to create your own, fully immersive worlds including interactable objects. Scripting &amp; Game modes (not yet available) ChilloutVR is built modular, allowing everyone to create interactive worlds with interactable objects or even full game modes - all using our in-house scripting toolkit 'Newton' (not yet available). This way we allow creators to create game modes like Trouble in Terrorist town, various kinds of coop tower defense games or even MMORPGs in ChilloutVR. The only limitation is your imagination and the players computer performance.
