It's extremely easy to pick up and friends can hop in and play a couple quick sessions without committing too much time. At its best, CHRONO showcases the tension between fast paced kinetic gameplay and anxiety inducing bullet time. CONTROLS left stick to aim, a to jump, x to shoot, and right trigger to slow down time. COOL STUFF: -five different colored maps -quick turnaround game time -low skill floor, high skill ceiling -controller support -minimalist and clean graphics -up to TWO players! ** LOCAL MULTIPLAYER ONLY ** ** REQUIRES 2 CONTROLLERS **",
