    "About the game": "Circuit City is a relaxing city builder game set on the surface of a circuit board. As USB cords and thumbdrives connect to your board and issue Algorithm commands, your data agents will carry them out on the board you've designed. As they work, they'll sing along with the working components to generate a unique song, just for you! Relax as your tiny digital friends do all the work, singing as they go! All you have to do is make sure they have the facilities they need to get the job done right! Execute actual computer science algorithms, bit-by-bit, in your circuit board city, or write your own with mod support! Research new components to unlock more advanced algorithm requests to seek out better rewards and resources for growth! Assign advanced specialist roles to give your agents a focused power or two... at the expense of disqualifying them from other jobs.",
