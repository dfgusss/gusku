    "About the game": "This 1-8 player party game drops players into riotous robbery scenarios where the goal is to collect as many valuables as possible and get back to the escape van before time runs out. Pick up loot and load it into the van to make money. Play smart by balancing many items at once for much bigger score multipliers. However, the higher a stack gets, the more wobbly and difficult to control it becomes. Rival crooks are out to ruin your plans and will hit you with items or dash into you, sending your stack sprawling around the room. If that’s not enough, each player also has the option to jump into the van at any point and make use of various gadgets such as dropping anvils, making earthquakes, spinning doors, placing banana skins, causing power cuts and lots more. Watch out for the guards too. They will cause you to drop your stack if they catch you. The Vault opens with 30 seconds to go in each level, providing access to a special item that is worth a potentially game-changing amount of points. Solve mini environmental puzzles in each level to get access to a one-off bonus safe. Then break it open by throwing it about to release the valuable item inside. Steal everything except the walls in various themed levels: a Jewellery Store, an Ancient Temple, a Lost Mine, a Speedy Highway, and an Underwater Paradise. A range of different game modes provide new ways to play for hours of fun: Free for all - grab as many items as possible before the timer runs out Last Crook Standing - knock down the other crooks by dashing and throwing items Teams - work in teams to grab the most items First to 25k - the first Crook to earn 25k wins Stack race - the first Crook to stack 10 items at once wins Stack the logo - stack pieces of the Crooks Like Us logo in the right order to score Customisation options are available: Change your hairstyle and colour, or choose to wear a funny headpiece to make your Crook stand out from the crowd.",
