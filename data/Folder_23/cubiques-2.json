    "About the game": "Cubiques 2 is the sequel of our acclaimed indie game 'Cubiques'. In this new sequel multiple cubes invade this simplistic but very challenging world. Every movement must be well thought out since each movement can affect multiple cubes in the environment. 'Sometimes things don't have to be complicated to be a good puzzler, and Cubiques looks like it might use the right side of minimalism.' Pocket Gamer 'If you enjoy minimalist puzzle games on your phone, you'll probably enjoy Cubiques. The art style goes for a Monument Valley kind of aesthetic.' Touch Arcade 'A minimalistic puzzle platformer reminiscent of Edge.' AppAdvice Features: * 70 unique and beautiful puzzle levels. * Beautiful black and white 3D isometric design. * Beautiful graphic design. * Simple keyboard arrow controls (WASD or arrow keys for movement). * Ability to scroll through already played levels providing you a way to track your best score. * Localized in English, Spanish, French, German, Romanian, and Italian. * Unique and relaxing music. * Menu fluid animations. Thank you for playing and supporting an indie game developer. Dilmer Valecillos",
