    "About the game": "Hello User, You might already know us since the previous program WPD . In this project our goal is to create the best tool for quick Windows customization! Quite ambitious considering there are dozens of programs like this already out there, ha-ha. Yet we still have a couple of aces up the sleeve. DashboardX includes an identical privacy module as in WPD , plus many new improvements that are already available or planned for release. Here are a few of them: UI We think that we have made a pretty cool interface, and, of course, we will continue to improve it. Presets Yes, now you can create and load presets directly from the main menu. Favorites A category where you can add frequently used switches. Search When you have a huge list of switches - search is simply necessary. Observer Keeps track of changes to privacy settings. For example, if you disabled something in the DashboardX , and then this setting was enabled again (outside the program), the next time you start the program Observer will highlight this setting in orange. That’s pretty cool, right? Tweaker (Shipped) A separate section for all your non-privacy settings. Constructor (BETA) Probably the coolest feature allowing you to add your own switches! *This feature is in beta testing on the Experiments tab, after that Constructor will be available on the Privacy and Tweaker tabs. Also: Hidden (Shipped) Ability to hide non-used built-in switches. Fast load (TBA) We plan to significantly reduce the program loading time. Workshop (TBA) The Constructor will support Steam Workshop. And most importantly, DashboardX , like WPD , works through the Windows API, leaves no traces in the system, and all settings are reversible (unless otherwise specified in the description).",
