    "About the game": "DepthQVR_AQUA is a fun, engaging, immersive ride &amp; casual gaming experience, a layered experiential environment filled with intuitive interaction, story immersion, and exhilaration. This novel application of virtual reality technology simulates a traditional indoor amusement ride on which passengers aboard a guided vehicle travel through specially lit scenes that typically contain video, animation, sound, music, game interactives, and special effects. We support Steam VR and 'Desktop' (non VR) gameplay modes; 'Desktop' is supported via Keyboard/Mouse and Xbox Controller. The AQUA themeology is a gaming skin, a stage dress that sits atop our evolving and entertaining game mechanics. The addition of optional motion simulation technology transforms DepthQVR® into a realistic ride experience for out-of-home PC Café, Entertainment Attractions, Brand Experiences, and Educational Attractions. The ride's immersive participatory nature, playful ‘natural-touch’ interactivity, and exhilarating body motion surprises and delights viewers of all ages, sparking lasting memories.",
