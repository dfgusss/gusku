You can add some style to your PC with your favorite animated backgrounds and not have to worry about the lag. DeskScapes uses its own established cloud-integrated library, WinCustomize. The in-app feature offers an easy-to-use browsing and navigation experience so you can find the animated or static background you want. Similar to the Steam Workshop, WinCustomize contains all community submitted artwork. DreamMaker Pro is designed to make it easy to make your own animated backgrounds. You can start with an image of your own or select one that comes with the app. When you're done customizing, DeskScapes will convert the file into a Dream, which will allow your PC to play the animation as a background. Add animated objects like clouds or lightning bolts, use brushes to apply overall effects like darkening at custom intervals, apply text while utilizing a variety of fonts, and so much more.",
