    "About the game": "A powerful (but easy to use) branching dialogue editor designed for story-driven games like RPGs and Visual Novels . Create complex non-linear data structures in seconds, no programming experience required! Works with Unity, Unreal 4, Godot, Construct 3, GameMaker Studio 2 and many more! DIALOGUE DESIGNER in a nutshell: Create non-linear stories Design in-game cutscenes Write branching conversations with multiple choise answers Control your dialogues and cutscenes with variables and conditions Create simple visual scripting systems Organize your characters and variables in databases Export to / Import from a single JSON file No license required. Pay once, and it's yours forever (along with any future updates). ----------- FEATURES: LIGHT-WEIGHT AND EASY TO USE The editor was created for non-programmers. It is easy to understand and navigate. It is also fast and lightweight - it runs smoothly even on less powerful PCs. BEAUTIFUL INTERFACE Minimalistic, highly usable interface. Two themes available: Blue and Dark . DATABASES The editor includes a characters database and local variables database (strings, integers, booleans). They are incredibly helpful in organising the dialogue and keeping track of player's progress. SUPPORT FOR MULTIPLE LANGUAGES Change the dialogue language by selecting it from a drop-down menu. There are no limits for the amount of languages you can use. EXPORT TO JSON FILE Export your dialogue with one click to a JSON text file. JSON files are simple text files, which are easy to read by a human (one like you!). In it, each key is assigned a set of values, for example: character: 'Matt', message: 'Hello!', is_happy_to_see_you: TRUE That way it is very simple to import into your favourite game engine or framework, most of which already have lots of tutorials and plugins for importing JSON files and creating dialogues using them. AVAILABLE NODES (input types): Show Message - Shows a dialogue message Wait - Pauses the dialogue for a given amount of time Execute - Executes a line of code Condition - Takes different paths based on a condition Chance - Has a chance of taking one of two paths Random - Takes different paths at random Repeat - Repeats a part of the dialogue x amount of times Set Variable - Changes a local variable Comment - Used for organizing the dialogue. The above usage of each node is just a proposition, you can easily repurpose each node to suit your needs. ----------- See the documentation if you need more help or contact me and ask a question!",
