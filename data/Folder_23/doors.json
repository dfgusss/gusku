    "About the game": "Bacon. Doors is an atmospheric first person logic game where you traverse a strange world in search of bacon. Designed for hardcore logic puzzle fans, everything is based on one simple concept. Use logic to determine where you will go - some doors lead to bacon, while others lead to death. You will be tested - but you will stop at nothing to achieve the ultimate reward in life: Bacon, and maybe begin to understand where you are. This is a short indie game developed by a one-man-team. Inspired by Limbo, The Stanley Parable, and the Portal Series, Doors attempts to bring something new to the puzzle genre. Website: /",
