As gamers, we search for experiences that aren’t possible in our daily lives. With F/A 18 Carrier Landing, we’re able to bring the armchair pilot into the cockpit of a fighter jet.

The F/A 18 cockpit is modeled with accurate detail. Reach out and touch the throttle, manipulate the flight stick, flip switches, and more. Your landing will be graded based on the weight of the wheels at landing, the distance from the center line, your approach angle, etc. Your score will be posted to the global leaderboard, can you rise the ranks?
