    "About the game": "You were in a situation that many post-graduates found themselves in, degree on wall, parent's house, everywhere seem to think your degree is just as useless as you do. The uniquely disparaging Quarter Life Crisis has came to you in full force, and you have been left with nothing to do.. And when university has set us up for unreal expectations of the future, there's only one thing left to do.. Grad School. Through insane luck or divine magic, you've received your acceptance letter to Vanaheim Home of the Vanaheim Institute of Magic and Technology There's only one problem, you're distinctly lacking in the magic department. In fact, this is the first time you've become aware of magic's existence. The internet as a whole was a huge inspiration for this game, We tried to set out to do something new that hasn’t been done in visual novels before by giving people an open world and focusing on character types and personalities that people really see in the modern day, instead of typical archetypes. We aren’t afraid to talk about issues like mental health, toxic masculinity, issues of self-identity and discovery, and the more complicated nuances of relationships. The candid and straightforward nature of the game is part of the reason I decided to reach out to you. The people who play the game really connect with it, and I want to have more people take a look and hopefully get the same impact from the game that the game and the community around it had on us. If you have any questions about the game, we have Steam Discussion page. FEATURES 300,000 word+ Story A true open world with free travel, leading to a different play through every time. Seven complete character arcs with over 20 endings Complete soundtrack with over 30 unique compositions Over 100 unique illustrations.",
