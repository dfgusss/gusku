Keep up with the fast pace and adapt yourself to the rules of each mini-game. Choose your street hero and destroy your friends in each game to become the King in the Streets. 1) Start a game with your friends. 2) When the game starts, elbow your friends. 3) In the middle of the game, stand in front of the screen to stop them from playing. 4) That’s it! You won! We promise you a 100% win but we are not responsible for the loss of friendships. Also, do not forget : No holds barred in the street. - Local Multiplayer : Play as one of the street heroes and dive into fun and dynamic couch games in free-for-all or pair up fights in 2v2 in the streets of Neo City. - Lots of mini games : 5 exciting mini-games alternating each round!
