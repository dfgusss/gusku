    "About the game": "Filthy Lucre is a tactical stealth HEIST game that gamers can play in single player and co-op, both split screen and online. With 15 missions across 5 locations, there are 30+ upgradable weapons and gadgets to unlock. Missions can be approached in a variety of ways. Stay low, in cover, silent as the grave with a hand-full of throwing knives, or try planting a remote mine and waiting for the right moment to hit the trigger… just don’t forget to clean up after yourself and move the body before it’s found! Every session plays out differently based on your actions, once you’ve started to bring on the heat, enemies will react and respond with brute force, so make sure you get out before the net closes in. Work together to accomplish the perfect heist! Players can equip items like the noise maker that can pull guards off their patrol routes to give them an opportunity for a silent takedown. In co-op, a well-timed diversion can allow players to sneak up on an enemy and take them down leaving a friend free to grab the loot. Set against backdrop of a gritty and crime wracked London, all missions are available at a glorious 60fps, in single player, local co – op and online. Filthy Lucre has full keyboard, mouse &amp; gamepad support, along with comprehensive Steam support including Achievements and Trading Cards.
