    "About the game": "You lose if an enemy reaches the bottom of the board. You win by clearing the board of enemies. Learn the rest of the rules within minutes of playing. Simple... ... but deep . 50+ handcrafted levels that require careful positioning of your heroes, proper sequencing of attacks, and the occasional stroke of mastermind insight. Play levels one at a time or all at once, as a break in the middle of your day or as a Saturday night marathon. You can even play Grimante in between other games! Created by a solo indie dev with a goal of making a niche genre more accessible, Grimante reduces tactical combat gameplay down to its addicting, puzzle-like core.",
