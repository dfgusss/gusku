    "About the game": "Groov is a frenetic dual-stick shooter that makes you the conductor of an intergalactic jazz fusion orchestra. Every action in Groov has a musical reaction, and with three unique modes, randomized music, and powerups that slow down the song (and your enemies), no two playthroughs are ever alike! This indie console classic, which earned praise from outlets such as IGN, Destructoid, Edge Magazine, VentureBeat, Official Xbox Magazine, and others, has been updated with achievements, global all-time and monthly leaderboards, and many other improvements!",
