    "About the game": "This ancient galaxy is under attack by the mysterious 'Apparitions'. They are huge interstellar monstrosities which threaten to consume the world. Your people will not surrender. Using a planetary warp-engine, you force your entire planet out of orbit, away from your familiar Sun, and into the darkness. Your enemy is out there - confront them head-on! Your planet is controlled using cards which you collect throughout the world. Build a deck of powerful weapons, shields, and other surprising and powerful effects. Ingenuity and resourcefulness will be the key to your victory! Rewrite your cards! Improve your deck even further by re-writing your cards! The game's unique crafting system is used to fuse cards into each other, allowing you to create unexpected synergies! For example, you can insert one card's text into a blank space on another, or you can carry a powerful bonus from one card onto another. In addition to cards, you can also upgrade your planet by finding unique tech which can provide additional synergy and firepower. The game world consists of procedurally generated maps of stars and clusters. Death is permanent – you start from scratch each play session, to explore the countless interesting possibilities that exist in the game.",
