A story-rich horror game with immersive stealth mechanics. Discover the lies and secrets of those who took everything from you, and restore an old kingdom to its former glory.

You're a prisoner, and you've never been here before - you won't find hints or guidance, maps or map markers. Depending on which secrets you find, you will end up with different endings.
