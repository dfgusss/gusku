    "About the game": "Six transmedial filmproducers, designers and storytellers decided to take the innovative transmedia theory to the game industry. The gameplay of this Indie puzzler is something players probably haven't seen before. The experiment and goal was to create a transmedial game and Highlight is the proof of concept. The proof of concept will take about half an hour to finish. In Highlight the player walks around inside of the head of Roos Deelstra and at the same time search around in her Instagram feed. The player will need Instagram to find the answers to the in-game puzzles presented in Highlight. The player will see two sides of Roos Deelsta during the adventure. The way she portrays her life on social media and how her life really is. Projectmanager: Sven Nagel Graphics: Marissa Vollema, Sanja Flonk Story Design: Tim Veenstra, Dennis Drijver Social Media: Guironey Coffi Programmer/Developer: Sven Nagel Actress: Daphne de Vries (Instagram has not promoted or influenced the game whatsoever.) (Everyone is absolutely free to use the content of Highlight or the instagram page: 'roosdeelstra' in any way they want.)",
