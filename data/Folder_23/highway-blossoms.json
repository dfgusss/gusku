    "About the game": "Highway Blossoms is a short yuri kinetic novel set in the American Southwest. After an old gold rush miner's journal is discovered, supposedly detailing where he hid parts of his stash, a nationwide craze begins as would-be prospectors try to solve its clues and strike it rich. Amber couldn't care less. Wandering the desert in a recently-inherited motorhome, she mourns the loss of her grandfather - indifferent and unaware of the hunt happening around her. It's not until she meets Marina, a young hitchhiker lost in New Mexico that the girls get swept up in the rush. At least tens of words, maybe even hundreds. Although the last word count puts it around 90,000, so expect 6 or so hours of reading. Grand, hand-painted vistas of actual landmarks in the western United States, all in glorious 1080p detail. A huge soundtrack featuring the works of Smoke Thief, Jake Abernathie, Able Kirby, and other friends of the team. Sounds right at home on your in-dash cassette tape player. Accessibility options for days, including the ability to skip through everything in less than five minutes. But who would wanna do that? Achievements, although to be honest, they might be stretching the definition of 'achievement.' Alternate silly content for second readthroughs that was written by the programmer with little to no oversight. This may or may not have been a good idea.",
