    "About the game": "Juicy Combat Out-boost your enemies, use gravity to your advantage and hyperspace-dodge through projectiles when things get too hairy. Endless Loot Make your jet stronger and stranger by gathering some of the 250+ currently available passive and active items. Use over 90 randomly modified weapons against your opponent, including aerial melee options. Fierce Opposition Engage zone specific enemy types in air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. Confront 10 distinct bosses and try surviving beyond that in endless play. Master the base game, then push your piloting skills even further in 12 different challenge modes. Developer Comments/FAQ What do I do in Hyperspace Dogfights? Mainly you fly a jet in a 2d environment and blow things up. You'll also complete randomized goals in order to finish individual waves. In-between waves you'll buy items that modify your jet in various ways. Zones end with random boss encounters. Difficulty is pretty harsh, you'll probably die a lot in the beginning. But each subsequent run will play out a little different. Throughout the game you'll unlock additional items to find on later runs. The game is fairly light on story, but you can piece together a narrative from item descriptions and combat chatter if you choose so. Feature list? - Juicy, impact-full and tense 2d air combat, framed in a weird sci-fi universe - 5+ player jets to fly, all coming with 2 alternate starting loadouts to unlock - 200+ different passive items, some providing simple bonuses, some completely changing how your jet behaves - More then 90 sci-fi jet weapons, including beam weapons, explosives and aerial melee options - 50 active items used for offense, defense or utility - Strong focus on synergies and weird jet builds. Most items will interact with others, be it in positive and negative ways. All passives can stack with themselves. - 7 zones with distinct enemy composition to explore - 10 bosses to die against - Various wave goals: Hunt ace pilots, strafe ground targets, perform recon scans and more - 12 late game challenge modes that can be freely combined with another - Colorful pixel art, powered by the Pico8 palette - An adaptive soundtrack with combat and menu tracks, consisting of 14 tunes by ENUIT and Ole Toensen (available as dlc) - Persistent unlocks with lots of items in the loot pool from the get go, but some things only unlockable through the endgame - Finished runs can seamlessly transition into endless mode if you choose so - Steam cloud save, cross platform I found a bug?!? We did a year long alpha but there is still the possibility that some things slipped through the cracks. Please report your findings in the steam forum or contact me on twitter or through the games' discord channel and I'll look into it. Thanks! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 Stefan Widany – Sleeper Games",
