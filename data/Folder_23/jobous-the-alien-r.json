    "About the game": "Travel trugh space with a big laser gun, and lot of wacky enemies and obstacles. Jobous the alien R is an addictive space shooter with a cute alien named Jobous. its just like an old-school arcade space shooter , but with an insane difficulty. the goal of the game is to get from point A to point B without crashing in anything or anyone. luckily its many power ups to help you stay alive. This is the type of game you will never complete. It is so hard that not only will your hand sweat. It will also fall off in the process . you will cry for your mother and praying to god, just to complete one level. Are you up for the challenge? (in other words a rage game) STORY: The story is sweet and simple. Jobous and his wife is living the dream in outer space. When suddenly ( dramatic music ) his wife want some new shoes. Oh no she is going to use all their space money (jup she is kinda a money spender). Jobous Immediately panics. What should he do? Jobous takes his ship and travel after her. Can he save his wife from spending all their space money on shoes?",
