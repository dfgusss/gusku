This war, that has ravaged Hell for over two centuries, spread to Earth some time ago. Johnny, the son of the old Satan, yet paradoxically, a freelance agent for the good guys, is seeking redemption for his centuries of evil deeds. He's been sent to stop the diabolical plans of the new party in power coming true. Johnny fights his way through the front lines of both sides to reach the grave of the original Satan, who is entombed there, but not quite dead...
