    "About the game": "'Morning light' is a brave knight, their castle was under siege by monsters, the castle food can no longer support the people's life, for the people he had to stand up to look for food outside. The Forest Knight is an adventure game. Players need only 'mouse click' to control the knight to jump to avoid the monster. You must be flexible enough to survive the monster and get as much food as possible. Being hit by a monster will lower your hit point, and when hit zero the knight will die. There is no way to attack in this game. All you have to do is avoid it. The movement patterns of monsters need to be explored by the player himself. It's easier to find patterns. I hope the players can get more food for the people. Maybe you'll find some unexpected surprises in the game. Maybe we will find more beauty in the casual.",
