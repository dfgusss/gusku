    "About the game": "Immerse into a colourfully ambient space, effortlessly glide through each world, and find your moment of Zen. Featuring 320 handcrafted levels Unique meditative gameplay Multipul input methods, mouse , controller , touch Over two hours of play time Over 1 hour of original music Breathing session Cloud sync Visual narrative ‘ Instagrammable ’ content to share Designed specifically to manifest relaxation and well being Inspired by the Zen calligraphy practice of Ensô, where every day you paint an uninhibited ink circle on a blank sheet of paper. Expressing a physical moment of reflection, focus, and freedom of flow. Kanso is carefully balanced to invoke the flow of this calligraphic practice as a unique gameplay experience. As you move around the circular forms, avoiding the Koi like Daemons, you will also find this flow, this moment of Zen. Navigate through ten worlds and explore over three hundred levels. Each level with a different circular shape to follow and guiding energies to avoid. Move with each guiding energy, a Daemon following its own distinct movement pattern. Some follow you, others avoid you, all of them moving in predictable paths that gently draw you into a tranquil gaming experience. Along the player’s journey they will encounter our breathing session, a place where the Ensô breathes along with you while calming music is played. Inspired by Resonant Breathing, the practice of slowing your breathing rate to approximately six breaths per minute. Slowing your heart rate variability, and resulting in a calm, de-stressed state of mind. I created Kanso to be a place of beauty and refuge from the noise of daily life. To bring players of every skill level into a meditative state of flow. Into an immersion of a calming experience. I hope you'll join me and find your own moment of Zen . :Dave",
