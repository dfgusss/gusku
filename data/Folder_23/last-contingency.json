    "About the game": "Welcome to a pre-release of Last Contingency! A post-apocalyptic based Survival game gearing towards Survival, I like the idea of a unique survival game that will hopefully build into something that will change the 'Survival' Genre &amp; flourish into may new &amp; creative ideas! Last Contingency has amazing &amp; great features you can explore throughout the game &amp; continues to be worked on. - creative building whether it be a shelter, box or a beautiful ranchers home! - crafting tools, weapons, clothing etc. - Zombies &amp; animals - inventory management Help us grow &amp; let us know what we can do as we like to listen to our community &amp; take their ideas into consideration as well! This game as mentioned is being pre-released so there's so much more to come! - new types of animals to harvest and use their materials for multitudes of things - more entities &amp; items to enhance crafting experiences &amp; building - gun crafting, which uses gun components &amp; materials to craft weapons making it a little more difficult to get to that end game experience. - team system - and much, much more!",
