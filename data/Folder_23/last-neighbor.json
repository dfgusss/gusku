    "About the game": "You play as a young thief who broke into the wrong house, he thought the place was empty because he saw the owners leaving with suitcases, but there was still somebody in the house. It could be dangerous so you have to get out fast. But the house is kind of weird, every door and every window is locked, it feels like a cage. Maybe the owners were trying to keep somebody locked down. Your main goal is to escape the house as fast as possible by unlocking doors and solving puzzles.",
