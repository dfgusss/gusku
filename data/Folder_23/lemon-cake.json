    "About the game": "Repair your bakery with the help of a friendly ghost! While the bakery might initially be broken down, overgrown and even… haunted?! Don’t worry! You’ll be able to repair, furnish and decorate every room in the bakery. As you unlock these upgrades, new features will be available to make it easier for you to run the bakery. You might even be able to convince a certain friendly ghost to assist you in the store and serve customers! Grow fruits &amp; take care of your animals in the greenhouse! The best baking ingredients are homegrown! Gather honey from your beehive, raise a cow to collect fresh milk and adopt a few chickens to add eggs to your recipes. You’ll also be able to grow trees and plants to harvest a variety of fruits… But don’t forget to water your plants and brush your animals, or else you’ll soon run out of ingredients to bake with! Mix recipes &amp; bake pastries in the kitchen! You’ll be able to mix ingredients together to prepare all kinds of recipes, including baked pastries, candies and frozen desserts! Once the kitchen is rebuilt, you’ll be able to bake up to three pastries at the same time… But don’t forget your pastries in the oven for too long, or else they might start burning!! Serve coffee and sweets to your customers! Be sure to serve your customers quickly and keep your window display well stocked so you don’t miss out on any order! Serve coffee to impatient customers to keep them around the bakery a bit longer… And build an adorable cat cafe to make everyone’s day brighter! Learn new recipes and select your daily menu! As you gain experience, you’ll be able to expand your recipe book and prepare new desserts! There are over 40 pastries to make in the game, such as cookies, donuts, cakes and candies. You’ll be able to select up to six recipes to include in your daily menu every day. Get bonuses and avoid penalties by crafting a balanced menu for your customers! Manage your schedule and get ready for the lunch rush! You’ll have time to prepare your bakery every morning before opening the door for the customers! This allows you to relax in the morning and get ready for the day at your own pace. Once the doors are open though, your customers will keep you busy until closing!",
