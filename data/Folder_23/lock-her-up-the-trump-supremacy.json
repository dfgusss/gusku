    "About the game": "In this super fake and politically inaccurate parody, you and your best friend play as Presidents Trump and Putin in an epic struggle against the New World Order AI Robot takeover! Lock Her Up: The Trump Supremacy is a fast paced survival shooter that pits your Presidential nerves against the endless ambitions of Madame Hillary and the Globalists. Trump and Putin will take on wave after wave of globalist robots in various locations around the world including the White House, the Alamo, and Moscow. They'll need to utilize the weapons available to them (handguns, M4, Minigun, and Sniper Rifle) to deal with hundreds of enemies. Will they survive each onslaught and finally be able to Lock Her Up? You don't want to miss this Co-Op experience filled with hilarity, out of context audio clips, and exploding globalist robots! '10/10 Perfect Presidental Game, No other game like it. ' -ColtonDReviews Online Co-Op Can we make this game Online Co-Op natively? No. Can you PLAY this game Online Co-Op? Yes, via Steam Remote Play Together. We've tested it and it works - keep in mind, though, the 2nd player will need to use a controller! And if you, as the 1st player, have a controller plugged in &amp; the game is set to 'Keyboard / Controller' mode, you'll need to unplug your controller otherwise the 2nd player will default to your controller as opposed to the one on their PC. *Thanks to PsychoBird on SoundBible for the sweet Eagle sound!",
