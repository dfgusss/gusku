    "About the game": "SONIFACE LAB VERSION While in the Lite version you can modify only one Maze, the Lab version lets you add as many new Mazes as you want. Further it provides up to 3 visual outputs and surround sound arrangement. LAB ESSENTIALS VISUAL INTERFACE &amp; SPATIAL SOUNDSCAPING The Lab version provides a special Visual Interface, to create sophisticated geometric shapes and play live with up to 3 separate designable outputs. Another essential feature is the integrated surround sound output to extend your Sets to 5.1 and 7.1 speakers and create spatialized soundscapes. MAZES: ARRANGE YOUR SOUNDS One Maze point can be Grid-Synth, Sampler and Rhythm at the same time. By the use of several Mazes, each one can be taken for a certain sound element. The Mazes list allows switching Mazes on/ off immediately, same as the instrument channels in a DAW. PATTERNS: PROCESS-ORIENTED WORKFLOW Every session starts with the first pattern. A Pattern includes the current Mazes on the screen, their on/off values, the tempo and the Grid type. The way of composing follows the process of cloning and transforming the first pattern, or adding a new pattern to start from scratch. MAIN FX &amp; RECORDING The main audio effect controller comes up with a Filter-Echo, Filter-Reverb, Flanger &amp; Reverser. The Main FX gives easy options for live improvisations, for Pattern transitions or session recordings. THE BASIS THE GRID The main synthesizer in Soniface is related to a Grid. Spread across the screen, each line is related to a tone. Grid types differ in the number of tones. Use multitouch to activate the Grid-Synth. In addition, the Grid visualizes certain instruments and effects. GRID-SYNTH: SOUND &amp; SHAPE A simple finger tap on the Maze point in the centre will give you access to the Grid-Synth Sound Interface. The controller points work in relation to their arc and radius e.g. Wave for volume &amp; frequency. Each controller can be automated. COLOR &amp; CHORDS The Color Interface defines the pitch of Grid-Synth, the Bass Synth and the Granular Harmonizer. A ring around the 24 keynotes is a sequencer. SAMPLER: EDITOR, LIBRARY &amp; SEQUENCER The Sampler provides recorded soundspaces and instruments, which can be looped by In&amp;Out points and sliced with the Sequencer. By activating the GridSound function a Sample becomes the base of the Grid-Synth. SAMPLER: GRANULAR SYNTH Extending the Sampler module the Granular module lets you generate and model new sounds out of samples. Therefore it’s sliced into small audio grains to organically stretch the sound endlessly. RHYTHM: SEQUENCING &amp; MODULATION The Rhythm Interface is for drum loops and bass lines. Different quantisation options allow to set various rhythms. The sound modulation offers controllers to create a hybrid sound of drum sample and synth. RHYTHM: BASS-MODE, SOUND FX &amp; ENVELOPES By turning on the BassMode button the sequencer switches and bass notes can be placed. The Bass envelopes provide the change of volume, filter and pitch. The effects section provides high- and lowpass, echo, chorus &amp; distortion. HYPERFACE CONTROLLER: GRID-SYNTH, SAMPLER &amp; RHYTHM The Hyperface can be used by multitouch for sequencing drum steps, dynamic envelopes, filters curves &amp; audio effects at different sequence speeds. BLUETOOTH &amp; ABLETON LINK Soniface supports playback via Bluetooth devices. Ableton Link can be used for synchronization with other music apps. ABOUT MAZETOOLS Developed by Stephan Kloss since 2011, the apps combine music and technology in artistic practice. Following a musical approach that focuses the process of making sound, many enthusiasts pushed the project with feedback. We look forward to the future and more Mazetools! ECTOPLASTIC LAB Stephan Kloss and Jakob Gruhl met in 1999 as HipHop and electronic music enthusiasts. Since 2013 they have been doing independent research on music, art &amp; technology. The Mazetools development is closely connected to music music projects &amp; sound design, generative art, VR development as well as giving workshops.",
