    "About the game": "Militia is back with more bite-sized strategy that evolves to match your skill! Rank up in both Push World and Beam World by using creative combinations of Militia to beat back the ruffians that challenge you! Militia 2 features a host of intriguing new Militia and dastardly enemies, spread across two distinct and fascinating Worlds. In Push World, you'll cleverly reposition allies and enemies and dunk them into the water with a satisfying splash. Beam World has players reflecting magical beams with various interesting effects to help and hinder friend and foe alike. Militia 2 is designed with clear and transparent rules for both your units and the enemies so you can spend your time focusing on your tactics rather than memorizing complicated rules. Brought to you by the makers of Solar Settlers, Minos Strategos and Axes and Acres. Praise for Militia 1: '[Militia] might be the best single player strategy game I've played this year.' -Keith Burgun (Lead designer of Auro, Dinofarm Games) 'Militia is potentially a true star for strategy gamers.' - PlayPlayFun 'Really digging this so far. It's like a party-based Hoplite.' - IndieGameHunt (Game Jolt editor) Steam Reviews for Solar Settlers: -'[Solar Settlers] strikes the balance between casual fun and strategic gameplay.' -'...a deep and challenging strategy game I would definitely recommend.' -'An absolute gem of tactics and strategy, in a tight little package of awesomeness.' -'This game is one of the best designed games I have played.' -'Surprisingly deep gameplay and heavily addictive!' -'Every game from BrainGoodGames is now a must buy on release day for me.'",
