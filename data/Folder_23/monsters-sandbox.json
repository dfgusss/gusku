    "About the game": "Main game In 'Monsters sandbox' you will find several small locations where you can try game modes such as wave mode, object defense, deadly combat, cooperative play in random maze. During the game you get points for which you can buy weapons for the next matches. In the multiplayer game can simultaneously participate up to 4 people. Mechanics The game has a detailed model of damage to the enemy. For example, hit the legs of a zombie and he will crawl for you, hit into the hand and the monster will lose his hand. This distinguishes the game from other games and shooting becomes quite interesting. The game implements a simple inventory system - you can find and pick up weapons or ammunition and throw it away by sharing your weapon with a friend. Сonsidered gameplay and relatively small spaces of the game will not let you get bored!",
