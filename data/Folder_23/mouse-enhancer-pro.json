    "About the game": "Mouse Enhancer Pro helps you entirely kill mouse acceleration and get raw linear input that is enforced, when you disable enhance pointer precision in windows It’s not entirely disabling acceleration. Turn off mouse acceleration and force linear input in seconds Smart revert allows you to go back if you don’t like the changes Zero curve input which allows you to be precise Removes annoying windows filters on your mouse Kill mouse smoothing filters that add annoying velocity to your mouse The tool enforces relative input and disables mouse smoothing. This means input will feel 1:1 and have no delay or change depending on your flick or movement speed, it can be really bad for FPS games that require absolute accuracy. This tool can be great for general computer use, games or even graphic artists that need pinpoint accuracy. Leaving mouse acceleration enabled or not entirely disabling it could lead to: Feeling like your mouse is slower than your aim Jittery slow input Mouse moves differently depending on movement speed Great for games and software such as: Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Overwatch PUBG Fortnite Apex Legends Fortnite Rust League of Legends Rainbow Six Siege Realm Royale Graphic Tablets Graphic Illustration And anything else you can think off. Improve your precision in seconds!",
