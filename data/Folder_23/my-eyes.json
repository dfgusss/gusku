    "About the game": "In My Eyes , you may have lost your head, but it's never to late to make things right. Right? Use your mouse to aim and shoot your new found powers of laser vision. It's that simple. Work your way back up to the top of the cave systems where your body awaits you. It may seem simple, but even sitting still for too long comes at a cost as the heat from your laser vision builds up in your head. My Eyes may look like a silly, casual, physics game, but it is much more grueling than it might first appear. My Eyes is a casual physics climber that dives into the reality of impulsive decisions, enduring consequences, and personal responsibility. -Experience the thrill of having laser vision, and also...being a severed head! -Use your laser vision to take flight though six beautiful maps with danger looming around each bend. -Manage the pain of shooting lasers against the build up of heat from not shooting them. -Enjoy the soothing insight of your head's inner dialogue juxtaposed against it's pain filled screams. Take aim, take flight, and shoot your way to redemption in this absurd, yet simple, point and click, physics climber!",
