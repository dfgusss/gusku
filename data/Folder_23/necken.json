    "About the game": "Necken is a simplistic roguelike that let's you explore the deepest parts of the Swedish forest. Take control of the people lost in the magical forest, gather resources, craft your equipment and fight your way through the randomly generated adventure. The forest is full of animals, soldiers and mystical creatures, and neither of them wants you around. Key Features Generated forests - There's no way you'll find the same spot twice! Permanent death - A small mistake can take a few minutes before it kills you. Minimalistic controls - So few buttons to learn. Almost annoying. Crafting - Make sure you always have the gear you need to fight your way to the end. Turn based combat - Tactical decisions without being swarmed by nasty boars. Unlockables - Which trinket will enhance your playstyle? A basket? A hat? Who knows. Resource collection - Hoard so many different rocks. Unlockable characters - 3 characters with 3 variants each.",
