    "About the game": "Night &amp; Day is a unique puzzle platformer. Help Night and Day navigate each level by solving puzzles to progress to the next room. Night dies on contact with light and lives in the shadows. Only Night is strong enough to push objects. You manipulate switches, buttons, boxes, and grow vines to open up paths which allow both Night and Day to move around. One day, they embark on an adventure of friendship and cooperation. Their actions can influence the other. They must work together to achieve a balance between shadow and light for as long as possible.",
