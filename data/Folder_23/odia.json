    "About the game": "The demonic forces of the ODIA are invading... and you are one of them. Many of you may fall to bullets and flame, but your task is sacred. Take the cathedral, ascend the citadel, and bring judgement down upon those that have sinned. GENUS Inspired by the early first-person shooter games, ODIA recreates that experience, combining it with a slower, more deliberate pace of gameplay to test your patience and skill. MILATARIS Wield the treacherous bone-rifle in one claw, and your rusted shield in the other, as you march across the battlefield on your crusade. Fight the staunch Gottheim alongside your brethren to complete your sacred task. EXPISCOR Scour the land to unlock your march forward, while the people of Gottheim defend their homeland at every turn. Secure the keys to victory by slaughtering them like animals.",
