    "About the game": "Plastris is a puzzle game about filling in all cells on the screen. Two differently shaped tools will come to your aid: the first one is used to fill in the cells it overlaps and the second - removes everything from the ground it touches. It is a hyper casual experience, aimed at people who want to simply sit down and relax. You can skip any area you don't like and revert performed actions as many times as you wish. Complete puzzles at your own pace and engulf yourself in a calm world, filled with pleasant music. :) There are a total of 195 puzzles in the game and you are free to determine their order. The difficulty of aforementioned levels ranges from 'easy' to 'slightly challenging', which makes Plastris a great introduction to puzzle games, even if you have never experienced this genre before. Last but not least, Plastris itself is a mystery to be unraveled. Everything in the game is represented with the help of intuitively recognizable symbols, which can be easily understood by players of any age and nationality, but don't expect to see any text in it! :) Come challenge your mind today!",
