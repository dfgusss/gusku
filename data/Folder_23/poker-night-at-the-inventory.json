    "About the game": "***Not Compatible with Mac OS 10.8.x and above*** Prepare for a different kind of poker night in a very different kind of club. In Poker Night at the Inventory, you'll deal with Penny Arcade's clever, cunning Tycho, Team Fortress 2's hulking Heavy, Homestar Runner's self-proclaimed 'awesome icon' Strong Bad and the hyperkinetic 'rabbity-thing' from Sam &amp; Max. These characters come together in ways some never thought possible, in a setting few would have predicted. Unlock new TF2 items by beating The Heavy, Max, Tycho, or Strong Bad at high stakes games of poker. The Enthusiast's Timepiece: Tycho's favorite timepiece (equippable by the Spy) License to Maim: Max's Badge (equippable by all classes) The Lugermorph: A second chance at Max's personal armament (equippable by the Scout and the Engineer) The Iron Curtain: The Heavy's first love (equippable by the Heavy, obviously) Dangeresque, Too?: Strong Bad's styling glasses (equippable by the Demoman)",
