    "About the game": "Play as Terence Lebrun, an investigative journalist working on an investigation far too big for you. You've been investigating the activities of the Local Tax Administration and Regulation for months, with many plainclothes soldiers entering the building and not leaving for several days. You receive a call from your source in BLARI, and it's time to go and investigate on the spot: it's a disaster. What you find on the spot has nothing to do with taxes, the situation has changed and now you have to get out of the building at all costs to avoid getting caught. In this horror game with graphics inspired by the PS1 confront the entity before it gets too strong, surround yourself with the right people to get out alive! An original and very open independent survival game. A stylized graphic style inspired by the early PS1. Choose your ending, you decide who to help and who to kill. Explore a large map and multiple zones. Escape the entity's grip, find its weak point and exploit it. An exciting original sound track by Neku Sheyen from the Starrysky group.",
