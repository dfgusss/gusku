This powerful software guides you through the process from beginning to end, giving you practical and legal information to make the best decisions for you and your family. Quicken WillMaker &amp; Living Trust is the original will-writing software, created and updated regularly by Nolo’s experts. Make living trusts to spare your family the hassle and expense of probate. WillMaker also includes health care directive, durable power of attorney, final arrangements, letters to survivors and much more. Will-Writing Software The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues.* Making a will rarely involves complicated legal rules. If you’re like most people, you won’t need a lawyer. With good do-it-yourself materials, it’s not difficult to make a will that takes care of basic concerns, such as leaving a home, investments, a small business, and personal items to your loved ones. With Quicken WillMaker &amp; Trust 2020 you can: Revise and update your will at any time Appoint guardians for your children and pets Name an executor (or ‘personal representative’) to carry out your wishes Appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people How Do Living Trusts Avoid Probate? For many Americans, a significant goal of estate planning is to avoid probate. A revocable living trust, unlike a will, offers a fast, private, probate-free way to transfer one’s property after death. Although a living trust is not a complete substitute for a will (it doesn’t allow you to name a guardian for a child, for example), it is definitely a more efficient way to transfer property at death, especially large-ticket items such as a house. A Living Trust will ensure that your property bypasses lengthy and expensive probate proceedings. A living trust is about as easy to prepare as a will. Do-it-yourself and save hundreds of dollars on attorney fees. Durable Power of Attorney A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your “agent” or “attorney-in-fact”) will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made, and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. You can also give your attorney-in-fact authority over your digital assets. Health Care Directive or Living Will Spare your loved one’s difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions. Includes a health care power of attorney and a living will. Final Arrangements Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more. Letters to Survivors Use the Letter to Survivors to leave your loved ones detailed explanations about your decisions. For example, you may want to let them know why you made certain gifts or named a person to be your executor. You can also use your letter to leave some general thoughts about your life. *Documents reflect the laws of your state – estate planning documents are not valid in Canada, Louisiana and US Territories",
