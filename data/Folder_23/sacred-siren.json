You’ve accepted your fate and now await being pulled down into the depths as punishment for your foolishness. Then out of the haze of the torrential downpour, the sky begins to open up, shining down a deep purple light revealing a mysterious island not too far off in the distance. You quickly head towards the shore to avoid capsizing… Created By: Nanoshrine/Jameson.T - @nanoshrine Music By: ᔕᙡᓮᙢ ᔕᗢᘎᒪᔕ - @SwimSouls Assets From: UE4 Marketplace, CGTrader, free3d and Turbosquid.
