Each puzzle here has been lovingly hand-crafted by Mark Goodliffe and Simon Anthony, the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic. They've even included their own hints on each puzzle to help if you get stuck. Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship. Features: 40 hand-crafted levels 5 new levels every month for the first year (a total of 100 levels!)
