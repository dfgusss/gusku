    "About the game": "The opulence and prestige of Shanghai attracts the greatest talent from all over the world to compete and battle their way to the top of the corporate ladder. You begin as a rookie, looking for clues on how to survive the wild paper jungle of your office: you'll face treacherous middle managers, venomous co-workers, and more, on your own, personal journey to the top. Will you become king of the jungle, or stay just another paper pusher? Get ready to start your first day at the office, with all the pain and glory that comes along! Key Features: Story Shanghai Office Simulator is a story-driven game where your actions have consequences and the story develops accordingly. You start out as a 22-year-old college graduate who has just landed his first job. The time has finally come for you to take on projects, deal with co-workers, and battle the “demons of your mind”. 'Mind Demons” The psychological issues of the office environment are personified as mind demons who will come to haunt you throughout your career. These include interesting and funny characters such as: Card Battles “Time management”, “Overtime” or even “Work overnight” …. Utilize these career survival cards to battle against your Mind Demons. Obtain new cards by mastering skills taught by seniors, from leisure time self-study or through self-reflection. As you grow your deck, you will be able to unlock special combos which can give you an advantage against harder enemies as your career progresses. Relationships Manage your relationships with a broad variety of interesting personalities such as “Fangirl”, “Copycat”, “Prude”, “Goof-off Guy”, “Flirtatious Assistant”, “Mom”, “Dad”, etc.… And as your relationships improve, you gain an edge over the ever-returning Mind Demons. And who knows, maybe you will even find someone to marry? Just don’t try to marry your dad… that would be weird! Inheritance System If you are so lucky to have a child, you will be able to pass on all your knowledge and valuables, so when you start playing as your own child, you can take the lead at the very starting line. - Now get ready to enter a journey into an office environment full of strange coworkers, see yourself ending up in weird situations, and learn some funky skills that you may or may not be able to use in real life!",
