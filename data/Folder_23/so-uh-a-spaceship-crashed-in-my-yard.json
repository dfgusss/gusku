    "Release date": "Aug 6, 2018",
    "About the game": "A spaceship named Aria crashed into your front yard! Now it's up to you to find the parts she needs to escape Earth. The gameplay is a 'walking simulator' type game with a little bit of light puzzle solving. Takes 20~30 minutes to beat. Meet and talk to NPCs. Find and combine items to get the parts Aria needs to return to space. 100% free. One ending to choose from. Parental discretion is advised due to some strong language and a weirdly large number of jokes about pants. History We originally made this game during a frenzied weekend gamejam in 2014. I rediscovered it on my hard drive in 2018, and released this new edition with achievements, bug fixes, and other improvements. It's a small game, but I hope you have as much fun playing it as we had making it!",
