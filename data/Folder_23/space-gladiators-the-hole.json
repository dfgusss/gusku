    "About the game": "Fight your way out of a planet prison in this 2D hand-drawn roguelite platformer! You've been captured and sent to entertain aliens as a gladiator in a faraway planet called Tartarus. You will have to advance through randomly generated biomes with deadly traps and monsters blocking your path. Choose your opponents in the arenas, beat them for items and coins and you might be able to earn your freedom! This is a prelude version in which you'll have to escape the first area of the game called The Hole. Tight and fluid controls that allow you to dodge and fight enemies without taking hits - the only ceiling is your own skillset! Fight your way out of the first area of the game through hundreds of hand-crafted rooms. (full game: 3 areas, hundreds more rooms) 20+ enemies and 1 boss to beat (full game: 50+ enemies and 10 bosses) 140 items including pets, weapons and trinkets that unlock new abilities for your characters. Pop your heart out to heal yourself, throw meatballs or fire a laser gun. (full game: 360+ items) Play as the first 2 characters of the game, including the infamous space potato. (full game: 8 characters) Customize your runs by choosing harder paths if you're feeling confident or easier ones if you're on the brink of death. High risk, high reward.",
