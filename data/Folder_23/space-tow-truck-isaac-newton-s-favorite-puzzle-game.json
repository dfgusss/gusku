    "About the game": "Hello space traveler! Use the laws of mechanics to get out of trouble! Control gravity, orbit around black holes, master parabolic trajectories, and more! Here is an example of the kind of puzzle that you will have to solve : With this game created by a physics teacher, physics and puzzles are intimately linked! Each game world covers a different physics concept like position, velocity, acceleration, etc. You will challenge your kinematics skills while using : a Spacetime Vortex to repair your car a Teleport Beam to change your position Dual Portals to make displacements an Antimatter Impulse to change your velocity an Electric Impulse to apply a delta-velocity to your car an Advanced Laser Beam to control your acceleration a Gravitational Wave Beam to control gravity a Patented Black Hole Technology to apply circular motions to your car About the lore of the game, completing each level will reveal the history of science in the level selection scene. As you progress, you will also know more about the Moon, its craters, its seas, and the space landers that dot its surface. Finally, the 7th world of the game is dedicated to women in science (out of a total of 1600 craters named after scientists on the Moon, only 32 are women!).
