    "About the game": "Recalling the straightforward and addictive challenge of 8-bit classics, Squad Killer puts you in control of a retro arcade experience with a little modern flair. Graphics are presented in pixelated two-tone style but offer a touch of detail, customization and precision that pushes beyond the limits of its inspirations. Adjust the color palette, choose between multiple play modes, purchase upgrades and overcome unpredictably shuffled stage order with each run! The objective is simple – clear all enemies from the rooms you enter, obtain a key and proceed to the next level. But victory is far from certain as new types of enemies aim to end your run and a boss encounter awaits every five stages. Kill or be killed! Take each one down quickly and strategically to collect coins and buy power-ups to stack the deck in your favor. GAME FEATURES: - Jump, shoot and collect coins as you turn each room into a pixelated massacre! - Throw grenades to clear enemies faster! - Flip tables to hide from enemy fire! - Knee slide through bullets and enemies to avoid damage! - Play through 20 levels with each run, shuffled to keep you on your toes. - Unlock Boss Rush to challenge all the big baddies with no help from power-ups. - Try your hand at Stacked Deck mode to start with 7 random upgrades. - Adjust the distinctive two-tone color palette to suit your style!",
