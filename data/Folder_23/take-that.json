    "About the game": "The inspiration for making the 'Take That' is derived from when I play a lot of shooting games, I often must go through login, selection, matching and many other complicated processes. It took a long time to finally begin to experience the core content of the game. Why is it so troublesome!? Sometimes, like my lunch break, I just want to play a quick game. So, I decided to make a game without so much nonsense and can quickly start the game, a shooting game but like mobile games can be opened at any time to relax. Fast-paced shooting game, can quickly play the core content, this is the core feature of this game! For now, the game has four modes: Quick Mode, Endless Mode, Story Mode and Mini-games Mode. Quick mode would be the main mode. Features of quick mode It can be started within seconds Three difficulties for each map Maximum 5 extra waves Three enter-points can be chosen Hire bounty hunters to help you Story mode has a completed story-line with little animation films for each level. Endless mode is a new mode where players play on a much larger map and clear battle points. Enemies drop items and so on. There are also three different mini-games playable now. If you like to know more about mode intro, you can check the update blogs. I have post few blogs to intro more detail about this game.",
