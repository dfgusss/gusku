    "About the game": "Tangledeep combines the 16-bit graphics and polish of classic SNES-era RPGs with elements from roguelikes and dungeon crawlers to create a magical experience for players of all skill levels. Trapped in underground villages with no memory of the world at the surface, you must survive an ever-changing labyrinth to discover what lies above. Experience rich, tactical, turn-based gameplay as you explore a sprawling dungeon that’s different each time you play. Tangledeep features a customizable job system and hundreds of collectible items that allow you to approach each playthrough in a totally new way! The Setting For hundreds of years, people have lived in the safety of underground settlements and villages – where the only route to the surface is “Tangledeep,” a mysterious and ever-changing labyrinth. With memories of the surface world long forgotten, you set out for the labyrinth to discover what lies above. With each floor – full of magical beasts, ancient automatons, bizarre environments and hybrid biomes – the mystery grows ever deeper… Key Features Experience finely-tuned, procedurally-generated and handcrafted gameplay as you fight challenging monsters, complete quests, and collect rare items. Master deep, tactical turn-based combat across 12 unique jobs with over 100 skills. Choose between three game modes – including Adventure Mode, which removes the pain of permadeath. Capture nearly any monster in the game and raise them in the Monster Corral as a pet, or breed them with other monsters! Make your experience easier, harder, or just plain wackier with over 10 included Game Modifiers Share some of your progress between characters by using the banking system and planting magic trees Explore ITEM DREAMS, randomized mini-dungeons where anything goes, and power up your gear! Take in the scenery – comprised of beautiful 16-bit graphics and carefully handcrafted maps! Relax to a beautiful soundtrack inspired by the most legendary RPGs of the SNES era, composed by award-winning composer Andrew Aversa – joined by Hiroki Kikuta (Secret of Mana), Grant Kirkhope (GoldenEye 007, Civilization: Beyond Earth), and Norihiko Hibino (Metal Gear Solid 3, Bayonetta) Participate in daily / weekly challenge runs and compare to your friends with Leaderboard support!
