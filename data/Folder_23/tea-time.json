    "About the game": "Attention Tea Drinkers! Bad guys have stolen the world's supply of tea and it's up to you to stop them! Choose from two characters - Polly, an extroverted and excitable girl, and Esther, an introverted but loyal girl - each with two powers to choose from to assist you, to try to get the tea back. If you play your cards right, they might be joined by a third, unlockable character to boot! This is a high-score focused game, in which you try to collect as many falling tea items as possible. You'll travel through five different stages, each with obstacles that will do their best to put a stop to you, either by keeping you from collecting items or by claiming enough of your lives to make you game over. Aim for as high a score as possible, and submit your scores to the Leaderboards to see how you stack up against others!",
