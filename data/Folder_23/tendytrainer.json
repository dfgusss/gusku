    "About the game": "Practice save selections. You can choose where shots go (example: high glove or low blocker), and the shot speed (easy, normal, or hard). Or you can go with total random shots. Challenge yourself with drills. There are a selection of drills that challenge you to improve positioning and make more saves. Face a realistic shooter. All shots you face are created with animations from real shooters. See puck perspective replays. After a shot, you can watch the replay from the puck's perspective. This is great for seeing your positioning and what holes were there. Customize your settings. You can adjust where the shooter is and if they should move. Both normal and righty modes are supported. With TendyTrainer, you'll never be limited by ice time.",
