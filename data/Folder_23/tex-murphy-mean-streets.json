You've been hired by the beautiful daughter of a university professor to uncover the facts about his death. As you begin your investigation you uncover the deaths of several prominent members of the scientific community. Are these deaths coincidental or is there something more sinister going on? And which characters could have a motive? Could it be J. Saint Gideon, former head of British Intelligence? Could Frank Schimming, president of the largest surveillance company in the world be hiding something? Or what about Sylvia, the professor's daughter. Is she as innocent as she seems? And why is an infamous Detroit hit man in town? You'll interact with more than 27 digitized animated characters who respond to questions, bribes, and threats. You'll rummage through offices, warehouses and factories looking for clues. With out innovative 'tree' system you can search without typing. Use your Lotus Speeder to fly to major cities along the West Coast. This land/air vehicle is a full 3-D solid fill flight simulator. Stunning 256K VGA graphics combined with RealSound produce a software experience close to real life than has ever been achieved before. Some characters actually talk and respond to questions.",
