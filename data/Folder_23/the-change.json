    "About the game": "'In this game you can't do whatever you want' 'The change' is not a game. I mean, it is an indie game which wants to set a thought in your mind and in which you will be bound to go only ahead. Look forward. This game is a third person. Without 2018 graphics, indeed, but which wants to impress by words. Listen to me and discover the message behind the game. 'The change' is more like a story. A story which needs to be understood. When you'll buy this game, don't expect a very long gameplay, as this is my first game. I will grow along with my games.",
