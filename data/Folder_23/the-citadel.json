Hub areas serve as respite if you find the episode to be too difficult. ・Completely skill based: no cheap Hitscanner, all projectiles. You live as good as you dodge. ・Huge enemy variety and diversity. From axe throwing cultists, to suicide drones, to mecha tanks, and flamethrower troopers. Kick the Opponent into Lava! ・Light-weight enemies can be kicked and stunned. Get your positioning right, and you can also make them fall into a bottomless pit or lava. Upgradable Weapons ・Some weapons can be upgraded or switched to superior versions. Gibs! ・Enemies explode into chunks of meat or metals when they die. Ouch! Optional Features: Leaning and Weapon Jam The Citadel contains numerous optional features for added replayability and difficulty. ・Leaning can be enabled in a option menu. Dodging is not the only way to avoid the enemy fire. ・Weapon condition features can be enabled in a option menu. ・Automatic weapons can be jammed in the middle of a battle, and they will be eventually broken.",
