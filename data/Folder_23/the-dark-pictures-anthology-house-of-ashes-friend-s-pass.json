    "About the game": "The Dark Pictures Anthology is a series of standalone, cinematic branching horror games where the decisions you make in the game determine the story you receive. House of Ashes is the third game. In House of Ashes, at the close of the Iraq War, Special Forces hunting for weapons of mass destruction unearth something far deadlier – a buried Sumerian temple containing a nest of unearthly creatures. To survive the night below, they must forge a brotherhood with their enemies from the world above. Don’t play alone – invite a friend and share your House of Ashes experience. The Friends Pass works on a single save game and allows you and a friend one full playthrough of House of Ashes. A Friend’s Pass allows anyone who has purchased a copy of House of Ashes to invite a friend to complete a playthrough of the Shared Story mode for free. Your Friend’s Pass is a one-time-use key per game, so be sure to invite a friend that you can count on in those life and death moments. This new Friends Pass application will allow you to easily grab your Friend’s Pass Invite Key and will also be used to play with the invitee of your choice if you haven’t used a Friends Pass previously.",
