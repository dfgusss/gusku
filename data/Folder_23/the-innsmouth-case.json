This mysterious assignment takes you to the remote fishing village of Innsmouth, where nothing is what it seems… Save the girl, solve the case, survive Innsmouth! The Innsmouth Case is a detective adventure in the style of an interactive book inspired by the fantastical works of horror legend H.P. Lovecraft.
