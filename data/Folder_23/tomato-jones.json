    "About the game": "It is just a red tomato with a stupid hat. He tries to look like a cool tomb raider, rolling and jumping all over the maps. Help him find all the treasures in the mystic castle or watch him die...in many painful ways. THE GAME Tomato Jones is a physics-based puzzle/adventure game. It combines the classical gameplay of an RPG platformers with the skill driven game style of the ball rolling games. Your goal is to collect all coins and the hidden golden artefact at the end of each level, while avoiding various dangerous traps, obstacles and enemies. The game is crafted in the atmosphere of 'Indiana Jones' movies, while trying to be as funny and humorous as it can be. Take a look at the features: FEATURES 20 beautiful and challenging levels Great looking 'soft body' tomato physics World map / actually I'm not sure why I've done that thing. :) / New approach to camera movement and viewing angles Fun soundtrack and SFX Super cool gameplay Tons of ketchup And hey...you can also drive mine carts ;) Tomato Jones 2 and 3 are much more harder and advanced than their predecessor and we strongly recommend also playing those games, if you like what you see here. / / [/i]",
