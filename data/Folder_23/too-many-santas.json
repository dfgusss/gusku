It's simply TOO MANY SANTAS! Can you watch all of them and run the store at the same time? Or will you be caught up in the sweet Santa romance? Too Many Santas! The short visual novel where YOU get to date Santa Claus! And Santa Claus, and Santa Claus, and Santa Claus... Sexy Santa.

Is he the answer to your prayers? Sleepy Santa. This Santa is pretty tired, but who cares? His beard is AMAZING! You could watch it all day long. If he needs a nap that badly, he can be YOUR cuddle buddy... Sassy Santa. Hey, who let this guy in here? Sassy Santa is always ready to dish out insults and put-downs to everyone who comes by. Can you rein in his sharp tongue, before he scares away all your customers? Sad Santa. Poor Santa is sad, and you're determined to figure out why. Everyone should be happy at Christmas! Maybe your love will be enough to cure Santa of the holiday blues? Secret Santa. Part spy, part jolly old elf, Secret Santa is all business. He's extremely busy on an important mission, but he refuses to tell you what it is. Will you be the one to crack his secrets?
