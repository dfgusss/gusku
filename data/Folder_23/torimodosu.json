    "About the game": "Torimodosu is a first person action/exploration game. Taking place in a sacred land that has been over run with an invasive force from the west. In dark times like these you rise from your deep slumber. It is your purpose to reclaim this previously peaceful land and remove the darkness that comes with these invaders. You awaken in a group of mysterious islands that have become isolated from each other over the centuries. Reconnecting these islands through ancient gates is an essential part of moving forward. Accomplishing this task requires traversing steep cliffs, deadly enemies, and cursed waters. All taking place in a fully dynamically lit open world during day or night. As you further explore the islands you may find points of power that you can absorb to grow stronger. Bring a sword to a gun fight. Not only did the invaders bring firearms with them, but their presence alone has rekindled a darkness that was thought to have been sealed away. Using supernatural agility and deadly katana skills is the only way to rid the land of darkness.",
