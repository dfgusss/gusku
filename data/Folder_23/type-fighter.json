    "About the game": "Run as far as you can by typing words to jump, fling arrows, slide and swing your sword. The more correct words you type the faster you run and the more complex the words get. - Jump pits and crates. - Shoot monsters with your bow and arrow. - Slide under rocks and pillars. - Crush monsters and crates with your sword. It's game over if you get hit by a rock or fireball. It's also game over if you fall in a pit or stand still for too long. Don't stop. Don't Die.",
