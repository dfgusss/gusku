You build small boats for trading and big ships for taking over more islands! However, you are not the only one with big dreams. Your ambitions are contested by 3 other pirate captains: Your relationship with each of them can influence your chances greatly. Once one of them becomes fully hostile towards you, the captain will come out with their flagship and attacks you. Defeat this boat and they will be wiped out! You will need to defeat each one of them to win the game.
