    "About the game": "As orphans, Jenn and Tristan's life path brought them to a mysterious scientist, who took them in and cared for them as his own children. But one day, he disappeared under very odd circumstances. While searching desperately for him, the duo found a hidden cellar and the Moon Gate portal, transporting them to a dangerous parallel world where goblins thrive. Your adventure begins as you fight to bridge these two very different worlds. ● Play a dynamic &amp; deep side-scrolling RPG beat‘em up as Jenn and Tristan, solo or in co-op, as you explore the four unique biomes of the goblins' twisted world and the stylish world of the humans. ● Customise your combat gear by unlocking &amp; upgrading hundreds of weapons, armour sets and accessories, to save the world as you know it. ● Unlock unexpected story paths as you fight your way through dozens of epic dungeons, hordes of enemies and over 20 fearsome bosses in the goblin realm. ● Young Souls combines the classic beat‘em up and story-rich role-playing genres through a beautifully crafted story, and in a world crafted with stunning art direction. Fighting goblins is not as easy as fighting the weight machine at Happy Fit. Combat is punishing and demanding, but you'll be rewarded with loot chests, which will help you forget the injuries you suffer on the battlefield. There are tons of possible combinations that vary the stats of your equipment, weapons and the gameplay of your character. Adopting an attacking, defensive or balanced strategy is easy for anyone who dares venture to the land of goblins. Brawling with enemies obviously means epic boss fights that will make you sweat. Young Souls is a journey between two worlds, each one full of experiences and encounters that will shape the character and fate of our heroes. After a well-deserved nap, you can hit the gym at Happy Fit and improve your statistics to gain more strength, resistance and stamina. If you're not too stiff, make sure to pay a visit to Solid Sneakers to get yourself the best kicks in town that will give you style and boost your characters' stats on the battleground. Teen Spirit shop is also open to those who need a makeover or just purchase a cool hat that fits with your brand-new sneakers. When you are done with having fun, it's time to kit yourself out from head to toe and enter the world of goblins – the place you want to be to bash some skulls and find the professor. Mobs of enemies will be waiting for you with spears and swords in the vain hope it will be enough to stop you...",
