    "About the game": "Beat Boxers is the world's first Rhythm-Fighting game, in which champions from the world's best musical genres battle it out their quest to win over the crowd and steal the spotlight. The idea is to feel like you are not only in a fight but in a performance. It's not just fighting to the music, its fighting WITH the music and using it to 'beat' your opponent. In this one-on-one contest of skill, players prove which musician reigns supreme on stage!! The closer you hit to the beat of the song, the stronger your attacks, blocks, and throws. Keep up the rhythm and out-maneuver your opponent. Who ever pleases the crowd and fills the performance meter first wins! You can also import your own songs and play to the music.",
