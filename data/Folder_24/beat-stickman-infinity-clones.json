No one knows who created it, and why? Stickman can not feel pain or anything at all. Stickman cannot die too, it just can be destroyed and re-created immediately right after, again and again. And lastly, Stickman is cursed to be tortured forever, its destiny is to be beaten endlessly…well, until the end of space and time.
