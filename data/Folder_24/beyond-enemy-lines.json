Make sure to use all available tactical elements and gadgets to decide the struggle in your favor. Use your knife, a silenced pistol, the map computer or even a whistle to distract guards and strike from the shadows. Or grab an assault rifle and a shotgun and go the offensive way! Unlimited Solution System All missions are designed in an open way. There are thousands of routes, so make use of your equipment to find the most efficient way of completing your mission!
