    "About the game": "BirdGut is a hand-drawn 2d puzzle-platformer set inside the internal organs of a bird. A bee hatches in the hive, but something's wrong. Born different from the others, the bee is exiled from the hive and forced to survive the world on its own. That is, until a bird attacks and eats it. But that's only the beginning... Inside the bird, all of the bugs that it eats are brainwashed and put to work in fantastical, mechanical factories that exist in the place of its organs, except for the outcast bee, whose very disability prevents them from being brainwashed. The bee takes it upon itself to destroy the massive bird from the inside out, and free all the enslaved critters within. Features: A curious hand-drawn art style, with plenty of quirky moving parts A wealth of unique environments to explore, each with their own special obstacles and puzzles Physics-based fun, and classic platforming A diverse cast of insect characters Three separate endings to choose from Hidden Secrets in every level 22 achievements to collect Giant worms",
