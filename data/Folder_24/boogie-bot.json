    "About the game": "Boogie Bot is a fast and challenging survival platformer about getting in the zone and finding your groove. Every mechanic in Boogie Bot is designed to keep you moving. Bot-Tom’s battery (health) is constantly draining, so Bot-Tom must keep going and collecting CDs to replenish this fuel. Bot-Tom has an energy supply called the boogie meter, which fills as Bot-Tom runs to the right or drains when he stands still. Bot-Tom is able to use this boogie energy for special abilities like slow motion, air-dash and healing. If the boogie meter reaches a 100% charge then Bot-Tom can BOOGIE DOWN, going invincible for a short time while his speed increases drastically. Bot-Tom can also wave jump, which converts battery life into upward momentum. Many of Bot-Toms abilities shoot sound waves that can harm enemies above, below or behind him.",
