    "About the game": "Brain Meltdown - Into Despair is a platformer game with a unique concept, where you need to control two characters by yourself. (This is not a co-op game!) Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot. – Charles Chaplin To clear the basic difficulty level of Brain Meltdown - Into Despair, you may play 2~4 hours and try 300~500 times. It is no wonder you die several times in this game. So, do not despair in any circumstance. At first, you would feel difficult to just move two characters at the same time but after hundreds of times of despair, you will find two characters happily hopping over our beautiful map! Into Despair is also a fun game to watch others streaming their gameplay! In our game, there are several serious obstacles that may hold back players, but in the eyes of viewers, those obstacles look not that serious...well, they look so easy peasy lemon squeezy! Viewers might scream, 'What an idiot! Why die there!' Never be afraid of trying this game! Even my mother cleared all stages after hundreds of times of trial. Give this game as a gift to your friends or favorite streamers!",
