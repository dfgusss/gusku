Choose between a variety of skins for your character. Customize your character with a variety of weapons. Choose the actions for your character. You can then use time control to pick the perfect pose. Dynamic lighting controls. Control camera position, zoom, depth of field, and fog for the perfect cinematic shot. STUDIO is Early Access and so has some rough edges and there is a long list of features we would like to add. I look forward to hearing your feedback so we can build this studio together! Support us with in-app-purchases:)! DX11 card required. In order to unlock ray tracing and path tracing features, Nvidia RTX is required.",
