    "About the game": "Chipmonk! is a retro-inspired Beat 'em up starring chipmunk warriors! The gluttonous gray squirrel has stolen all the land's food stores, threatening the forest’s inhabitants with starvation. Embark on a perilous journey as a chipmunk martial arts master — Grey, Cheeks or Red — as you battle a multitude of foes in a heroic attempt to recover the stolen food. Are you nutty enough to take on this venture? 1 - 2 player local co-op: Go it alone or team up with a friend. 3 playable characters: Play as Grey, Cheeks, or Red - each possessing their own strengths and weaknesses. Multiple game modes: Embark on the classic adventure, battle an endless onslaught of goons, and more! Retro pixel aesthetic: Look at the size of those pixels! Easy to pickup: See how far you can get mashing buttons or master an assortment of more advanced moves. Beat 'em up nostalgia: Inspired by classic Beat ’em ups such as Golden Axe, Battletoads, and Streets of Rage/Bare Knuckle. Go nuts and fill your cheeks! NOTE: Controller or 2-button mouse recommended",
