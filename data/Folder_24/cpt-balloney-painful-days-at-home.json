    "About the game": "Play as a former captain (of a space ship) on the run in the frist part 'painful days at home' when your ship crashed and you had to hide inside the home of some unknown guy. Enjoy a gameplay with no hassle, as time doesn't matter here, promise. Just combine items you find to make your way back into space. This is a promotional shortgame where you can expect a playtime of around 25 mins . But it heavily depends on you. If you're a hardcore progamer, experienced in all historical p&amp;c adventures, this is a simple walkthrough for you. If so, be our guest and consider yourself a patron of the next part, which shall have a playtime of 10-20 hours estimated. Your comments will greatly help us making a much more accurate guess about that as well. For the not-so-hard coregamer, just enjoy clicking around and guess what to do next. There are some hints and some 'hidden' items to combine. Have fun and post your thougts about it, as they will influence the next part quite a bit which is planned to come this year. What's in the game: *graphics *animations *sounds *music *story What's not: *lootboxes Medium important note: Be sure to check the 'manual' included, especially about using the inventory by clicking the top black bar in the game... !",
