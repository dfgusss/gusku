    "About the game": "Cube Chase is a short but challenging 3D platformer; your primary goal is to reach the glowing golden cube while avoiding lethal and non-lethal obstacles. Challenge your reflexes, navigate obstacles, dodge guards and pass checkpoints to unlock new areas. Cube Chase is a simple but fun, quick and addictive game, designed when I was 12 to learn programming, after years of Minecraft command block creations. Use Z or W (forward), Q or A (left), S (backwards), D (right) and spacebar (jump) to move. Key Features Lethal obstacles send you back to your spawn point: Guards Spikes Chasers Reaching one of the other glowing colored cubes sets your spawn point there and unlocks a new area. Reaching the golden cube unlocks the next level, (harder of course!), 5 in total. Dev Notes I started making this game when I was 12 as a fun way to learn more about programming and game design. I worked really hard on it for about a year, and was tempted to polish it more, but I’ve moved on to other projects so just want to release it here for my friends to play. I previewed it with my youth group who loved it, and I appreciate their encouragement - thanks everyone =) I’m now 14 and while this game is far from perfect I poured many hours into it, I hope you enjoy it!",
