    "About the game": "Cypress Inheritance: The Beginning came out in 2014. We went through a lot of changes after the launch and added two fairly large areas that made up the three chapters of this first game. We did have some issues to address and have done this as well as improved greatly on what is currently available. However, because of the way it initially came out, we did not see the results we wanted and certainly want the game to be what it was supposed to be. We have been working to rebuild this entirely in UE4. We have gone through a lot of changes in the company and this has taken longer than we expected but we are still working to complete and get launched. We are confident we will get the game to where it is an exceptional experience, very engaging, with replay ability because of design. . In our rebuild in UE4 we are also adding a considerable amount of additional content with several changes to the game play. CITB when done will be what was intended, but dramatically improved, with using the benefits of UE4 and many additions to the game play. We also are making tremendous changes to all the art , UI, characters and overall flow of the game. Additionally we are adding achievements and trading cards. You can view some of the current game screen shots in rebuild at the bottom of the page: A few of the newer features will include: • 1st and 3rd person perspectives, your choice. • You will have choices on clothing and the ability to change while on the mission. • A very strong inventory system. • An in game map system with scrolling ability, as well will be upgrade-able. • Detailed weather system that does effect the character and achieving goals. • Rebuilt in UE4 • Re-shot and new in-game cinematics • Complete overhaul of SFX and FX systems • Completely new assets including character, animations , and props • New Context based diegetic UI/UX • Redesigned AI for a more challenging and engaging experience • Additional localizations • HTC vive support • Oculus rift support • Steam controller Support • Steam Achievement’s • Steam trading cards • Steam Cloud save We will also be localizing in multiple languages to give the user a much better experience.
