So at level five, you will have 5 abilities during an attack. One new ability will unlock with each new level. A PvP building improves your abilities when attacking an enemy forest. There are several buildings and even creatures in the game designed to play only against each other. There are 8 heroes in the hero pool at the moment that you can encounter in your forest. One of the heroes becomes available for attacks on enemy forests for three weeks. This hero is available for attacking an enemy forest: Other Side Improve and destroy Anything in your forest can be destroyed or improved. You can improve anything in your forest after each enemy raid, from trees, mushrooms, and buildings to heroes and creatures. During battles, when a creature is directly involved in the fighting, it gains experience. Your creatures and heroes, as well as your main character gain levels in this manner. They gain 5 skill points for each level and possibly even new abilities. Scrolls, weapons, items, plans, resources, and phials All inventory items are divided into six types and all six types are available only during the game session. After killing monsters, certain items often drop. They can be one of six types of resources, mana phials, health or experience, plan for a structure, one-time use magic scroll, summon tornado, trap, or something else. At the moment, there are a just over a hundred items drops in the game. The forest Even mushrooms and trees have a purpose in your forest. Trees can be used for more than just protection and barriers. They are very important. For every tree in your forest, all your objects, including the main character, can evade physical damage by a certain percentage. Mushrooms affect the ability to evade magic damage. Many heroes become stronger next to trees or mushrooms, and some can even heal themselves by destroying trees. Important: Remember that if the number of trees in your forest falls below 30, you will lose the game and have to start over. Heroes and Higher beings At the moment, the game has 8 heroes and 3 higher creatures, similar in nature to heroes, but do not require any resources (creatures or heroes). Your heroes, like the rest of your creatures, can gain experience in combat. They acquire a new ability at every other level. All characters patrol your forest. The first hero arrives after reaching the fifth level. Heroes: Imp, Otherside, Witch, Orc Traveler, Mishka, Making Money, Kaba and Winterstale. Ancient, Evil Mushroom and Warlord. The first two creatures do not require creature resources. If an Ancient is a very expensive creature that costs a large number of resources, Evil Mushroom costs just 50 mushrooms growing in your forest. Also remember that one elder is available to you at the very beginning of the game. the Ancient and Evil Mushroom do not patrol the forest like your heroes and can obey your orders outside of combat. Both have full view of the forest. Accordingly, when battle begins, they attack the closest target. In the case of the Ancient, of course, only if it is awakened. The Warlord is a PvP-exclusive creature. You can summon him only by attacking other's forests. Dark Forester is made by a single, obsessed developer.
