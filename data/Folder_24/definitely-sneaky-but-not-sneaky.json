    "About the game": "Definitely Sneaky But Not Sneaky is a top-down action-stealth game consisting of a multitude of compact, difficult levels. Hack, slash, and shoot everything in your path using anything at your disposal. Throughout the game, earn points to unlock different weapons, items, and skills that you can combine into your favorite load-outs! Action-Stealth gameplay Most levels allow you to approach them in different ways. You can either sneak into each situation and slowly take out your opponents, or you can run in and try to beat the level as quickly as possible. New survival mode Need something else to do after playing the Classic mode? Try out the new Survival mode! Endure never-ending waves of enemies, purchase upgrades with kills, and explore the larger maps made just for the occasion! Level editor with Steam Workshop integration With the built-in level editor, create all the levels you can see in the CLASSIC mode and more! Build your own levels, string them together into level packs, and share them with the Steam community via Steam Workshop. Download others' published packs to play for yourself. Controller support With both keyboard/mouse and controller support, you can play the game whichever way is more comfortable. May it be keyboard and mouse, a PS4 controller, or an XBOX controller, all you have to do is plug-and-play (..and go into the options menu)! However, it is important to note that the game will play better with a controller. Local multiplayer 4-person local multiplayer is also supported with the ability for mixing different control types (one player on a keyboard, another on a PS4 controller, and a third on an Xbox controller, etc.) in order to get as many people playing as possible. Use Steam's new Remote Play feature to play with other Steam users with just one copy of the game! Play the entirety of the game with some friends or play solo, it's up to you!",
