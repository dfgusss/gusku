    "About the game": "** New LARGE update coming in 2022 ** We have stayed in EA for this long to wait for an equilibrium in mainstream VR now we have this we are working on a BIG update for this game. Bringing the graphics to 2022 along with gameplay to a lot higher standard. Welcome to Demonic Guest VR. Player position should be sorted out from current update, if not please let us know! NOTE: It is important with the HTC Vive to stay within the blue circle in the headset for the best experience DGVR is designed to be an horror experience, this means there are NO controls, you enter the game a look around and try to survive the night. Created in VR for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift we put you in the room, where things are happening and there is nothing you can do about it!. The story : You wake in the night, strange things have been happening around your house and you have no idea what is lurking, is something coming for you? you have no idea. Tonight is the night, you are locked in your room what will happen, is there an escape? so many unanswered questions and so little time. The experience is in Early Access at the moment and runs for around 8 minutes. Although this time is short we are committed to updating on a regular basis adding new content. In each update we move closer to adding controller support and a means of physically moving around the house essentially creating 2 games for a low price. We would like to thank everyone who has purchased this experience and welcome any reviews good or bad as its YOU who will help shape this experience and upcoming game.",
