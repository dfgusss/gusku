    "About the game": "Dungeon Raider is a hardcore endless hack 'n slash runner with RPG elements. You play as an adventurer lost in time and space, with enemies and traps behind every corner. Explore a seemingly endless tunnel full of mystery and death, find mythical creatures, many foes, and few friends! You can unlock different weapons so you can proceed further easily. What more do you want? 'If I can beat this game, so can you!' - One of the people who made this game. Each monster has it's own battle style and way to be defeated. The rest is adaptation and anticipation. The story is irrelevant as it happens in all time and space. But it will get clearer some time in somewhere.",
