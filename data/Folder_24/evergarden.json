    "About the game": "Lose yourself in an endlessly satisfying puzzle game set in the midst of a mysterious forest world. Transform your garden by combining plants into strange new forms, and unearth deeply hidden secrets as you become engrossed in the game’s calming rhythm. Wander into the forest and help bring it back to life with the help of Fen, your creature guide. Evergarden may feel familiar at first, but you will discover it is like no game you have played before. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q: What type of game is this? A: Evergarden is an “evergreen” puzzle game, set inside a narrative adventure. We’ve spent years developing the core puzzle game to be accessible and relaxing, but also very deep and strategic. On a basic level, you’ll combine plants on a board to create more valuable items, and grow your garden within a turn limit. The game holds a lot of secrets though, and most players will spend months mastering the strategies required to get a great score. This portion of the game also has a leaderboard. Beyond the garden puzzle board, there lies a mysterious forest environment to explore, with its own puzzles and progression. You’ll use the stones that you earn by playing the core puzzle board to solve puzzles, and unlock new “songs” which add depth and fun to the puzzle board. Q: How long is the game? A: The core puzzle game is “evergreen”, which means you can play it repeatedly and keep mastering it, without ever truly “completing” it. The adventure game portion will take most players 10-15 hours to explore, and there is also a daily challenge portion with a new procedural puzzle to unlock every day.
