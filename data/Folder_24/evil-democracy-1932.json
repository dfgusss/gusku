The elections to the parliament changed virtually everything... Chamberlain managed to become the winner in England just to give both Austria and the Czech Republic to Nazis without even trying to fight! At the same time, Nazis were able to win the elections in Germany. It was the moment when democratic elections could change the entire fate of the world. About the game. You have to become the leader of a political party. Your key goal is not to allow your main competitors to win the elections. Did someone mention a national socialist as the chancellor? No way... Not on my watch! You are the one to choose measures, which will lead you to the cherished goal. Will you use only truly democratic ways and approaches? Will you rather go to the limit? Print newspapers, write articles about the competitors, send your promoters, summon assemblies of the party members, start protesting and implement legal doctrines. In addition, there are always methods on the fringes of the law... You can use such efficient things as ballot-rigging and political racketeering. In fact, you are the one to create the image of the party leader.
