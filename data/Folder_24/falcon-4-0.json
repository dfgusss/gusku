Only the makers of the acclaimed Falcon 3.0 could launch a new era of flight simulators. Falcon 4.0 breaks the sight-and-sound barrier with its cutting-edge graphics, realism, dynamic campaigns and multiplayer gameplay. Only MicroProse could push the envelope to offer accurate topographical terrain, detailed radar and weapons simulation, hyper-realistic flight models and stunning visuals. Features: The realism in Falcon 4.0 is as intense as the vapor streaming over your leading edge flaps when you crank on the Gs. You'll recognize your Dogfight team members by their aircraft markings. Of course the guys on the other teams are ready to paint little bull's-eyes over them. At the heart of Falcon 4.0 is the real-time campaign engine, tested and approved by actual F-16 pilots. Falcon 4.0's detailed, accurate topology and stunning graphics break new ground in the world of modern military flight sims. In Falcon 4.0, you'll discover an enormous range of aircraft and ground units - all in chilling detail. Steam Trading Cards included!",
