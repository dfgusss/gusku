The mechanic is simple; eat smaller feesh to get bigger, and avoid being eaten by bigger feesh. Certain feesh have special abilities; Red ones make you smaller, and the jellyfeesh can sting you. Survive long enough, and you'll evolve! But try not to get naturally selected. And watch out for sharks. Some feesh are more rude than others. Observe the behaviors of the different types of feesh to find out what they do! Or just find out the hard way. Uses Steam Leaderboards! See how you rank against other players in the food chain Controller support! Or the game can be played using just the mouse! 2-4 player competitive mode! Chillout mode! Just chill and watch the game play itself in this ambient mode. sharks Originally made for the Ludum Dare 48 hour game jam!",
