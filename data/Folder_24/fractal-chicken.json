    "About the game": "In Fractal Chicken, you will explore worlds that are connected to each other through portals, all the while fighting the Demon Lizards. The first world is Earth-like, and allows you to begin collecting combat equipment. You can also start basic production from gathered materials (grass, dirt, stone, trees) to maintain your food supply and build other useful items. In your exploration, you will find portals to other worlds with alien terrain and harder enemies. Fight and build your way through these worlds, decide where to build your main base, and enjoy exploring the boundless worlds of Fractal Space, domain of the Fractal Chicken! * Infinite Voxel World in all directions, fully editable. * Multiple worlds to explore! * Weapons and item upgrades - feel your character get stronger and wiser! Kill lizards! * (basics working) Start a production chain to keep up your food supply and build items useful for combat! * Use equipped 'cooldowns' to float over terrain or fly a helicopter! * Options to make the game easy for noobs! * Immense wisdom from Fractal Beings, especially the most glorious, the Fractal Chicken! * Mostly open-source. Make your own world algorithm! Make your own game!
