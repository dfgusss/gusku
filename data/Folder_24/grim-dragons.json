    "About the game": "BE THE DRAGON! Slay peasants, eat livestock and burn villages! It's time to teach those pesky humans who's at the top of the food chain! Become a glorious DRAGON and terrorize the countryside in this exciting action-adventure game! Join Cyril, the Red Dragon, in his quest to oust the human vermin from his roaming grounds. There's only one thing standing in your way: an army of humans led by their Heroic Defender of Mankind who is... another dragon! (more to come on this in a future release...) Due to the limited content, the CURRENT PRICE IS 50% OF THE FINAL GAME PRICE. Early adopters will get this best price! The price will be raised over the next few releases. Check out the progress on facebook: / Why did I make this game? Well... I really wanted a game where I could be a dragon. Most dragon games aren't really about the dragons at all. They're about ... people ... that's right. And people aren't dragons, are they? It's time to have a new dragon game that's about, you know: DRAGONS! What are real dragons like? They're not your pets... or your animal friends. They're wild, majestic, ferocious forces of nature. But, they're not mindless. No - they're very smart... and clever... (well... sometimes.) Real dragons have character, personality, depth. You could even say there's a little human in every dragon. ( ... or maybe that depends on their diet.) Why should you get this game? Well... if you want to be a dragon - you should totally get it! Please, don't lose this chance to eat absolutely everyone!",
