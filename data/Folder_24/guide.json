FEATURES: – Glide, burn, and jump your way through five beautiful environments as you help Fia face enemies. – Built to compliment classroom, home, and therapy discussions about positive coping skills and cognitive behavioural therapy. – Designed by a multidisciplinary team with interests in psychology, education, and games for learning. – Collect in-game sensory objects and reflect on what helps Fia to relax.",
