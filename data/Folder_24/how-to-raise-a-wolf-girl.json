    "About the game": "Story Kousaka Shuuji's life in the country is turned upside down the day he and his friend Kana find a mysterious girl in the mountains. As if it wasn't odd enough to see a girl trapped in a cage, stranger still, she has wolf ears and a tail. When she finally manages to tell them her name, Sakuraba Iroha, they learn that she's the girl who was spirited away from town ten years ago. Now more animal than girl, wild and unable to speak, Iroha proves to be a handful for Shuuji, and yet he finds himself falling in love with her fierce innocence. But the torn pages of a calendar can never be restored, and Iroha will never regain her lost years. Her idyllic past behind her, Iroha now faces forward. Watching over her, Shuuji wonders to himself: What is it that makes me want to protect you? Iroha's past is gone but not forgotten, and her future remains unknown. What will she and Shuuji make of it? Features CG Gallery - View your favorite CGs! Music gallery - Listen to your favorite tracks!
