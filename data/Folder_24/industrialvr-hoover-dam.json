    "About the game": "Industrial VR is something new in the world of VR exploration and educational experiences. Combining an innovative documentary-style approach with visuals powered by Unreal Engine 4, the game takes players deep inside the most intriguing industrial facilities in the world. Players will go inside the pipes and through the machinery, a journey that would be impossible in the real world. How does a nuclear power plant work? What happens inside an oil rig? How does a hydropower plant/dam function? Industrial VR will answer these questions and many more. The southwestern United States' Hoover Dam will be the first destination for the series. For the first time, you will be able to go inside and experience for yourself the inner workings of mankind’s most impressive engineering accomplishments. You will see into the heart of technological feats with the highest level of access imaginable. This is Industrial VR.",
