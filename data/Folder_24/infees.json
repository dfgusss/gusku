    "About the game": "INFEES The game is currently in early access, I'm still developing it (Only by one person, me), so updates may come at different intervals, and present different content, but for now INFEES has full support for its community! What's INFEES? is a single player game that currently has one game mode 'Defense Mode'. 'Survival Mode' is in development. I have really big plans for this project, I hope that I can build the biggest community that ever existed ;) You can visit my other social media to ask questions, or check out the progress on the next game update! 📞Discord: ✉️Twitter: 🌐Facebook: -106336148390685 At this moment in the game there is one map with a 24 hour cycle of the day. As a soldier you have to kill as many enemies as possible. With the money you collect during the game you can buy better equipment (New weapons, player and weapons upgrades). In the game there is one normal type of enemy (Zombie) and two types of special bosses (Dammer Statue, Monstro). The gamemode is based on a system of waves each of them is stronger and more difficult to survive. 'Survival Mode' is in development and will feature procedurally generated vegetation and structures and will be all about survival and building shelters to last as long as possible. More information about the production roadmap will be posted on our social media in the near future.",
