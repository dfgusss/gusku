For a change this time it's not about little stones, instead there are marbles, tubes, discs and lots of tinkering fun ... ' - '... If you add in the high addiction factor, there can only be one conclusion: Logical is one of the most beautiful action puzzle games for a long time - an absolute must for friends of the genre'. But away with the musty dust. It's time for Logical Now! - Many discs - One color - Many explosions ... and off to the next level! Contemporary 3D Graphics Now in 3D rendering, with lights, shadows and great explosions! Sound and Music In High Quality and Even In Stereo! Fresh Levels Newly created levels, now with even more playing surface! New Game Elements Besides the known, there are many new modules in the game. How about 'Master Mind' Turnwheels, for example? Guess which color combination explodes! Or a few switches and walls? - Let yourself be surprised! You like games like Tetris? Then try the Demo of Logical Now! But be careful! This puzzle action game is supposed to be addictive - Be warned! :)",
