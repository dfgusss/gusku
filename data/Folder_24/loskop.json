    "About the game": "Loskop is a single-player puzzle game where you are the only one to blame in the end if Loskop the Junkbot never gets to see the outside world. You are being put behind the wheel of the robot and will maybe through what is considered mostly luck and grain of determination guide the robot through the old factory and to the outside world. The obstacles you will find on the way will challenge your previously gained experience from other games and most likely give you a headache or some grey hairs. Experience a different type of puzzle solving that you arent used to. By introducing the concept of second person puzzle solving you will meet and have to interact with puzzels that you cant solve from refrencing older games. Complete levels one by one in a linear structure.",
