    "About the game": "This game is no longer under active development. What if every apocalypse scenario happened at the same time? Welcome to LVL99: AxeRage , a gratuitously violent 2D Action-Platformer inspired by the iconic pop culture of the 80's and 90's. Based in a fictional Chile, this righteously brutal ode-to-Arcades is heavily saturated with references to many of the nostalgic low-budget B movies, old school anime, and classic SNES-era platformers that we know and love. Enter the fray as Cheins Tsurya, an axe-wielding renegade firefighter who must face an unholy apocalyptic menagerie warring over Earth’s vital energy. With brute force, a little supernatural intervention by some indigenous Chilean deities, and a RADioactive dog, players must free Earth from unrelenting hordes of aliens, robots, and zombies, oh my . AxeRage will also offer 2P Mode for the players who appreciate the camaraderie of couch co-op, introducing the gun-toting Tyrius Domain inspired by Terminator’s Kyle Reese. Gameplay is a close combat gorefest full of combos, plenty of hack and slash, and more platforming than you can shake an axe at. Take out waves of baddies with a diverse array of moves like Axe Uppercuts, Dive Kicks, Slides, and some pretty gnarly Special Moves that rock a blast-to-the-past feel with some modernized digital physics. FEATURES Vivid 16-bit aesthetic reminiscent of 90's 2D games, but with modern quality. Large array of attack moves and combos. Chain combos to fill your RAGE meter and unleash devastating Special Attacks. A huge variety of enemies that keeps gameplay engaging and challenging. Get ready for some brutal boss fights! Exploration-based stages with Save rooms, unlockable paths, upgrades, items, and secrets. Fierce soundtrack inspired by Retrowave music. Gameplay heavily inspired by the hot-blooded classic action platformers. And don’t forget to keep yours eyes peeled for some nostalgic 80's and 90's pop-culture references. Nods to Tremors, Terminator, Things, Street Fighter, Dragon Ball Z, and so much more. Are you ready to kick some Axe?",
