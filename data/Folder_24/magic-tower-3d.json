    "About the game": "Magic Tower 3D is a classic dungeon RPG made with a modern 3D blocky style visual presentation. The game is a hybrid of dungeon RPG and strategy/puzzle game. As the player, you have to figure out when would be best time to fight with a certain enemy, pick up an artifact or open one of the magic doors. Despite the simple design of the fighting system, the game is still addictive and extremely fun to play. - 22 uniquely designed dungeon levels - 40+ vividly rendered blocky-style characters - 20+ artifacts and weapons - Auto save/load at the start of each level",
