    "About the game": "Magic is a wonderful thing, so why not make more? In Mana Maker, your goal is to make mana so you can conjure minions to do it for you! Along the way, you can hire people to help you with other tasks such as potion brewing, scrap collecting, minion enchanting, and wand crafting! With 12 unique minions, 4 unique hirable people, 120 unique minion skins, and so many ways to play, you're bound to have fun! But magic isn't always fun, especially when dealing with dark figures such as Cthulhu! Who I am I kidding, even he is fun! Once you conjure Cthulhu, you have the option to Ascend, which will restart your game but give you a boost to your minions as well as 250 crystals(in-game currency).",
