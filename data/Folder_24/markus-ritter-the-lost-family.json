    "About the game": "Markus Ritter - The Lost Family is an homage to old point-and-click full motion video games from the 90s. This Demo was developed as a fan project made by two people over the course of one and a half years. Our goal was to catch the lovely trashy art style from that time, overacting, graphics and dramatics that takes you back to you childhood. The game takes place in Vienna, Austria. Markus is a young man without any ambitions in life just living from day to day. However he is haunted by nightmares that don't make any sense. The only reoccuring thing is a young woman in a white dress. Who is she? And why does she seem so familiar... Are they really just dreams? In this short adventure, play the first chapter in Markus's quest to become the person he was always supposed to be. Just some important hints: Always look to the book in your mobile (right mouse click). You will also get a sound when a new task is added. And if you can't find something, hold the space bar to see all interaction points. If you wanna support us even after the kickstarter campaign you can do this here: -ritter-the-lost-family/purchase The title song (Backdoor001) and Marie's song (So Close) are written and performed by the amazing artist Tina Mali linktr.ee/tinamali",
