    "About the game": "Iris works as a Purifier, a person who helps souls of the deceased move on to the afterlife. Her fate changes after coming into contact with the Magicians, half-immortal beings who watch over the MO worlds. Interacting with them, the mystery of the MO worlds' origins will come to light. Don't be deceived by the lighthearted parts--despite the fun fantasy setting, MO isn't a world that will let you survive with something as flimsy as 'the power of friendship.' This is a story written to make you both laugh and cry. At the very least, it has a lot of puns and glasses jokes. This game has a 75% 'made me cry' rate, according to the survey. ✦ Characters ✦ Iris: The heroine. A gentle, awkward, and surprisingly brave girl who tries her best. Rieffe: Iris' kind but detached childhood friend who always worries about her. Lanneis: A strict and sarcastic person who glares and pushes up his glasses way too often. Reqieu: Used to be Iris' teacher. Serious, but gentle and low-key sarcastic. Septem: A serious, kind, and dutiful boy who likes flowers. He's kind of shy once you talk to him. Always polite. ✦ Warnings: light/moderate blood, themes of death ✦ Standalone game but with references to the other Magical Otoge games (Ciel, Anholly) ✦ Stretch goal bonus routes added for free after purchase milestones (details in the Google Form after purchasing the game) This game is a straightforward visual novel, so there's no walkthrough necessary. It will be very obvious when a choice will affect the ending. After clearing the game once, a guide will appear in the Extras that explains how to get the Good/Bad Ends.",
