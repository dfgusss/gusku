    "About the game": "The somatosensory game made with AI technology does not need any somatosensory equipment. It is enough to turn on the computer camera. Game play Red / Blue joint can touch red / Blue column; In other cases, the game fails. The speed of the column will be faster and faster. Explain It's a boring game. Don't expect it to be fun. But compared with running for half an hour, it's more relaxed to play your favorite music while moving with the rhythm. (Please play your own music.) Scoring Usually, 10 points for touching the post. If you use the same joint continuously and contact the column within a relatively fixed range, the reward will be temporarily reduced. Yes, it's encouraging you to exercise more. Be careful 1. Make sure the computer camera is not disabled. 2. If it is a laptop, make sure the power is connected, otherwise the FPS will be very low. 3. If the human joints identified by the program are often inaccurate, make sure that: (1) The color of clothes should not be too similar to the background color. (2) The human body should not exceed the middle picture area, and the best distance is when the height of the human body is about the same as that of the picture. (3) The light should not be too dim. 4. If your computer performance is poor, the current game will not run smoothly (less than 40fps), please apply for a refund in time (or wait for me to complete optimization).",
