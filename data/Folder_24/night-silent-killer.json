Main features the truth Each side has its own stand and different views on the same matter. Which side would you choose? Play the role of a defender in a routine ceremony, or an enemy who brings chaos? Learn from the words of the host and the enemy, travel in the bluebird battlefield, and make a decision. Discrimination The enemy was disguised like our friends. The most important thing is whether we can find the difference between them. The spirit of the host does not seem to be very good. Under the heavy pressure, the confused words, together with the vague message of the enemy, cover up the truth. Power The master gives you the power to attack in different ways. Use energy and strength, wield a heavy wrench, and use extremely fast missiles to clear your target. High-level being [Red Ghost] gives you [Power].
