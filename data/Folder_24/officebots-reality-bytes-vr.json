    "About the game": "You know the program: get a job, work, retire, then die. But what if you could short circuit the employment machine, interrupt the process, and escape? You’re the new hire at a dreary office, recruited after your predecessor lost his head (literally). You’re expected to keep quiet, do your work, and be just another cog in a big machine, but instead you start chatting with your new colleagues. Each of them is a robot like you, disappointed by life and despairing of ever achieving their goals, resigned to spending the rest of their days stuck at a desk and staring at a screen. However, if you can get to know your co-workers, learning about their dreams and their secret loves, you might be able to help them. In the course of bringing a little bit of happiness to a group of depressed robots, you may even discover a way to escape this dead end job and find a little happiness of your own. OfficeBots: Reality Bytes [VR] is a little game with a big heart. Explore a wonderfully weird corporate office, listen to your robotic co-workers’ stories, and help to solve their problems. Ultimately your goal is to find a way to escape, but your journey to freedom will give you many opportunities to brighten up the lives of others. A byte-sized VR adventure that can either be completed in one sitting or explored at length. Optional quests and multiple solutions give you different paths to freedom. Explore a charmingly odd virtual office and discover everybody’s hidden secrets. Colourfully chunky robotic visuals paired with an emotionally resonant story. A big collection of Steam achievements to reward exploration and experimentation. VR exclusive title for HTC Vive and Oculus Rift designed to minimise motion sickness. If all else fails, you can find some catharsis in just trashing the place. OfficeBots: Reality Bytes was initially designed and programmed by an independent solo developer. Thanks to a marketing and release grant from Film Victoria, it has now being revised, enhanced, and expanded by the original creator with the help of a small team. By purchasing this, you are investing in the future of independent games.",
