    "About the game": "When world goes end, when everything lost they life. There are only two things still moving after. Me, and her. But, we are not heroes who can save the world. This is a story about purposelessly traveling. This story has no meaning at all. By the way, there are maybe one thing not so ordinary. she is a zombie. all characters are over the age of 18. ******* I saw some people want the English version of this game, So I am trying now. But as very poor &amp; noob almost lack of everthing developer, perhaps the effect is not very good. Howevey, I'll try my best, but please consider this issue before you buy it. All the best.",
