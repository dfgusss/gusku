Watch the story unfold as you reach the end to discover the truth behind the madness. Key Features: Visual appealing retro aesthetics and graphics. Rich audio content and ambient sounds. Minimalistic interface and graphic design. Intriguing characters and mysterious storyline. Mini-Map for level overview. Dynamic obstacles and environment. Polished control scheme and movement.",
