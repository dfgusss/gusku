    "About the game": "Pirate Popper VR is our take of a Bubble Buster game set in VR. A rival captain has stolen your treasure chests! Time to take them back. You will have access to 100 handmade levels that get progressively harder, with more on the way. Use the power of VR to pick up the cannonballs and drop them into the loader to arm your cannon. Think fast and try and get back your stolen treasure before time runs out. Will you try and get your treasure chests back as fast as possible or will you try to beat your high score! Hit other cannonballs of the same color to knock them out of the level and open up a path to your stolen treasure. Be quick in deciding what cannonball color you need but don't miss! You only have a limited number of Cannonballs per level. Go and get your treasure back!",
