I guess someone has to play hero now… Pitiri 1977 is an adventure-platformer with much exploration in both world and story, and is paying tribute to its classic pioneers – not only by its gameplay, but also by its background story. A narrative, that is set in 1977 (the glorious year of Star Wars IV, the Atari 2600, the Voyager One spacecraft &amp; Led Zeppelin's “Presence”), in an imposing world, created by using hand-painted graphics, characters, solid physics and a 1970s soundtrack, gradually opened up by the player’s acquired abilities. You play as a kid with supernatural powers, whose brother has been kidnapped by an unknown evil. On your quest to get your brother back, you venture through a twisted 70s science fiction utopia that lies beyond the known… KEY FEATURES Stylish 70s Setting Story driven gameplay Metroidvania like adventure Hand-painted Levels, Characters and Objects Solid Physics engine Cool 1970s Music 5 supernatural Abilities Sandbox Level Editor (Beta) Including full soundtrack! ★★★★ Winner of the 'Content Award 2010' for Games and the Impulse XC Sponsorship 2010, Pitiri 1977 is shaping up to be a rather striking-looking game. - indiegames.com ★★★★ Pitiri 1977 is easy to pickup, feels like a familiar platformer with the added excellence of special abilities to progress through each level, and is visually appealing is almost every way – especially the fantastic cutscene. - indiegamemag.com ★★★★ An excellent platformer game that is extremely well polished and has some very creative game play mechanics. - www.clickteam.com ★★★★ A jawdropping cinematic intro and an introductory level in a beautifully handpainted suburban landscape signal that these guys mean serious business. - Adam Dobay (Klikdisc)",
