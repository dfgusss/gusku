    "About the game": "Pupper Park is a sandbox game about dogs in a park. Play as a dog and fetch balls, run around, scare frogs, and play football. Try to collect as many bones before the park closes! Note: the game is best played with XBOX-360 controllers, press the spacebar to add a second player! Features 15-30 minutes of playtime (and way more if you are really into dogs). Local-multiplayer for up to 2 players. Cool playground to explore. Lots of dogs, 1 human. Fetch balls, throw frogs, earn bones. Funny procedural animations. You can bark. Sokpop makes a new game every two weeks! Subscribe for 3$ per month at",
