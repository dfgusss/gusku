    "About the game": "A sandbox, strategy PC game where you control Reek and Havok; two devlish creatures that aim to destabilize a town through chaos and destruction. Disguised as a civilian, they can poison wells, pollute the food, start fires and disrupt supply caravans, all whilst evading the law. The town itself will try and fix the damage caused, as well as bring the fiends to justice. This is where discretion and careful planning are key! This game is a work in progress! Do be warned! This game is in early access and therefore may contain issues and differences to the intended final product. For a look at what we have planned here is our roadmap! Feel free to contact us through the community hub, your feedback and suggestions are invaluable to improving the quality of the game.",
