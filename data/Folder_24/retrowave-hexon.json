    "About the game": "Puzzle in the RETROWAVE style, where you have to solve complex and difficult tasks in order to move the hexagons so that they all fall into the luminous places on the level. Hexagons can move in one direction and move other hexagons, they can not move at all, they can jump over cells, and they can move in two directions at once. All this creates many combinations of solutions, among which you must find the right ones. Sometimes levels will throw you really hard puzzles, but everything can be solved. And RETROWAVE helps. Many pleasant tracks will calm you down while you concentrate on solving problems. And in total 100 levels are waiting for you. Can you master them all?",
