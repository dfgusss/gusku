    "About the game": "Roko-Loko into Ratozinger’s Castle is a platform-styled action game. You will explore a huge castle with several dangers, enemies and dungeons. If you succeed at rescuing the rockstars and unlocking the castle doors, you will finally face the evil boss, Ratozinger. Roko-Loko must go through several stages and face terrible threats in this very fun game, which also features the most definitive rock’n’roll soundtrack in the gaming world. Roko-Loko, the ultimate rock’n’roll fan on the face of the Earth, must enter the castle of the cruel Ratozinger, an ultra-conservative religious monster who hates rock music and kidnapped his girlfriend Adrina-Lina and several famous rockstars. The Roko-Loko and Adrina-Lina characters were created more than twenty years ago by cartoonist Marcio Baraldi, and their adventures were originally published in the magazine Rock Brigade. Two successful books featuring them were subsequently released, and then the characters got their own game for PC. This pioneering project was born from a partnership between cartoonist Baraldi and Play Systems and SGuerra Design game studios. The re-release of the game for the Steam platform is a celebration of the 15th anniversary of Roko-Loko into Ratozinger’s Castle game, originally released on CD-ROM.",
