    "About the game": "Centuries have passed after an invasion by demonic entities, and humanity is on the brink of extinction. A young detective miraculously survives a train crash, and finds himself falsely accused of being a member of the rebel group Maelstrom. As things grow more and more chaotic, and more and more people are met, Adrien's view of the world is changed significantly. Despite this, not once does he lose sight of his destination. With no train to take him, he sets out on foot for the beautiful mountain called Candlelight Tor, refusing to tell anyone why he's going. By his side is a young man who is essentially his polar opposite...and yet neither traveller wishes to leave the other's side. Sanguine Melancholia is a tactical RPG set in a dystopian future where demons have decimated the population. The only way to make a difference is to Hunt, an illegal practice said to provide a rush like no other.
