    "About the game": "You are a stranded nobody, a single soul with no outside connections that are relevant to this story. You start off in a clearing in a dark forest with nothing but a flashlight. As you look to signal for help, what you actually get is quite the opposite... Game Features Complete objectives to advance in the game Use a flashlight as a tool -- and also a weapon Achievements (It works!) Replenish your Hunger meter by interacting with the hunger pickups Hamburger - Fully replenish hunger meter Taco - partial replenish of hunger meter Join our community and discuss what you hated about the game (unless you actually enjoyed it, in which case, great!) Still in development: In-game Options Full Controller support (though not required) A proper ending (seriously, it's just an end game screen with no fun pay-off yet)",
