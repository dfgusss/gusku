    "About the game": "Help Mike survive the delirious world of Divider, through three chapters of carefully crafted traps and moving screen puzzles. Get ready for a spin you've never seen before! • • • READY TO GET LOST IN A WILD ADVENTURE? ;) In Swaps and Traps, you'll find yourself in a unique puzzle experience with cursed keys and moving screens. Divider will swap, rotate and even flip your world. • • • A Hat That Changes Everything Mike is a decent man. An ordinary one, you might say. But he is no pushover when it comes to capturing the enchanted hat from his nemesis, Divider. You see, Divider’s hat changes everything, including the position and direction of the screen. Mike’s only hope is to collect the cursed keys, and catch Divider through different locations and traps. Swaps and Traps is a fun little game, which will challenge your platformer skills as well as your eyes and necks. As you collect a key in a scene, you also trigger the main trap of the game. Portions of your screen will swap, turn and even flip horizontally and vertically to give you one unique adventure.
