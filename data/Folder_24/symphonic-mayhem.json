    "About the game": "Symphonic Mayhem is a skill and strategy game that relies on both good planning and good execution (as well as plenty of luck). Your goal is to destroy all enemy tanks, using whatever upgrades you've equipped yourself with. The key to victory is choosing upgrades that combo together well. There are many different ways to play: 1. Singleplayer - Practice up, earn money, and gain exp against AI opponents. 2. Local Multiplayer - Up to 8 people can play on one computer together using the keyboard and gamepads. 3. Online Multiplayer - Up to 8 people can play with each other on LAN or across the internet with the help of VPN's like Hamachi. 4. COMING SOON! Online Matchmaking - Get paired up with random people online to test your skill against the world's. Earnings from the game will be going towards setting up servers for this. Different gamemodes including Capture the Flag, Ghost, and Powershift mode. New Maps, Gamemodes, Upgrades, and Skins will consistently be released to keep the game evolving. This is the company's first release, so expect problems at the start. However, these problems will be dealt with as soon as I'm aware of them.",
