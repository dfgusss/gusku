    "About the game": "The Baleful Tower is an isometric roguelike that combines twin stick shooting with hack and slash gameplay for an action-packed dungeon crawler. Play as one of many different character classes and ascend the mysterious tower, collecting upgrades and overcoming challenges. Throughout the land, all was at peace, till the mysterious tower emerged from another world. From the tower spawned forth terrifying monsters which terrorize the countryside. Once safe roads are now hazardous journeys. To vanquish these monsters, and glean something of the tower's origins and, brave adventurers venture deep within, carrying hopes of fighting their way to the top. Play as one of the, currently, six distinct character classes; blending their unique abilities with a mixture of ranged and melee attacks to fight monsters from a distance or in close quarters. While each class is capable of flexible strategy, you can enhance your favorite playstyle truly by making the most of the class’ essence, a powerful advantage for dealing with foes.",
