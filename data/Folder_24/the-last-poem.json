    "About the game": "The Last Poem – The Trials of Poe is a third person Action RPG set in the mid-1800s that sends the player into the shoes of Edgar Allan Poe. Not having any success with his writings, Poe finds himself in dire straights, where he makes a deal with Bragi, Norse God of Poetry. Years later, we find Poe having found his success and forgotten about the deal made long ago. Bragi appears one late night to collect payment, Poe having fought back temporarily is now on a journey to put an end to this pact and end Bragi’s degeneracy. In the Last Poem, players take on the roll of the titular character, Edgar Allan Poe, solving riddles and a few puzzles, players will battle their way with the magical abilities they acquire to defeat Bragi and his minions in hopes that Poe can free himself from the contract he made with Bragi many years ago. Defeated enemies give you pentameters, these pentameters are used to purchase skills or upgrade your HP and Ink (consumed when casting spells). Please note that this game is inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe, the themes are similar to his works but not directly taken from them to prevent copyright violations as some of his work has been adapted in other types of media. That being said, to play this game and be successful, would require some knowledge of Edgar Allan Poe and his work.",
