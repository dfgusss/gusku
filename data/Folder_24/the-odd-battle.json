So frequency of skill usage differs among the characters.   -We have three different battle modes.(Challenge, Versus, Chaos)   -In challenge mode, you will have to beat all the waves to get its character and you must try not to die. In versus mode you can fight with up to 9 enemies that you can choose in the menu.
