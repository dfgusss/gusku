    "About the game": "AN EPIC STORY INSPIRED BY CELTIC MYTHOLOGY The first meeting between the Celts and their gods, the Tuatha de Danaan, should have been a time of celebration and enlightenment, but when negotiations go catastrophically wrong, a battle against a god leaves you near death and untethered from time! Return to a land overtaken by magickal corruptions and a kingdom splintered into multiple factions warring for the throne. The Celtic society, a complex tapestry of different religions, human cultures, and mortal and immortal races such as the Mourians, Werewolves, Goblins, and monsters threaten to tear at every seam. Will you support the immature, yet rightful, heir, or the pragmatic general in their bid for the throne? What alliances will you forge, what friendships will you foster, what romances will you pursue, and... what will you do when you are suddenly thrust into Medieval Spain? EXPLORE TWO ERAS Things look pretty different in Galicia under Christianity than it did under Celtic rule. Magic is fading, religion is everywhere, and much has changed. Where are your immortal allies now, and what has become of the souls of your mortal friends? Discover changes made to the land over a thousand years of cultural change. Could the corrupt magicks that interfered during your meeting with the Tuatha have led to the destruction of all that the Celtic world held dear? GATHER YOUR PARTY The Waylanders draws inspiration from classic RPG, opening up a world of adventure for you and your companions to explore.
