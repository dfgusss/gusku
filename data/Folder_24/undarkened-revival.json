    "About the game": "Undarkened is a wizarding survival-adventure game where you must unravel the mystery of what, or who, corrupted your homeland. Explore a devastated world alone or with your friends, find out what happened, and try everything you can to save your home. You entered a portal with seemingly nothing wrong, but when you emerged, the world and everyone you knew was gone. Explore a world ravaged by corruption. Visit the ruins of places you once knew to uncover the mystery of what happened. Investigate sites of magical importance to try and resurrect a world fallen. Craft tools to help you survive. Progress from primitive stone tools to magic-infused instruments of the now. Conquer your surroundings with your arcane acumen. Construct a base of operations that rivals even the fanciest of castles. Store your loot and build stations to aid in the creation of mundane and arcane tools. Create magical machines to automatically obliterate nearby enemies, or to streamline materials processing and gathering. Make a spell table to develop and hone entirely unique spells. Survive using only the tools on your back and your wits. Dodge scary monsters and hunt animals for food and clothing. Destroy mystical beasts to create tools and weapons of the magical nature. Revive the world you once loved. Unravel the mystery behind the corruption and do everything in your power to reverse it.",
