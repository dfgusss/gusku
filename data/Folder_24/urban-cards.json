In this deckbuilder, you'll fight against sharkmen, developers, lenders, casino gangsters... and finally, compete against the oppressing power of the Government . This is a satire themed game with 4 factions and playstyles to choose from. Oper: The realm of the millionaire CEO, the workaholic suit, and the dangerous smile of a lending shark.

This is where bitcoin fortunes are made with other people's data, this is where big brother comes to watch.
