Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Gameplay Avoid flying pickets, carnivorous fish, deadly hairsprays, and a host of other surreal hazards while grabbing as much coal as you can. Be sure to collect the bucket from the first screen, otherwise all the coal will be invisible! This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
