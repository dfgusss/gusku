    "About the game": "White Shadows is a cinematic puzzle-platformer where you play as a little Ravengirl trying to escape a brutal dystopia founded on oppression and violence that puts her at the bottom of its hierarchical social ladder. Composed of a vast network of towers rising from the void of post-catastrophe darkness into the sky above, the city our young adventurer seeks to escape is a dangerous place to be. She will have to find ways to avoid the teeth of machinery primed to grind her into dust, leap across rickety infrastructure that bridges the cavernous darkness all around and avoid the watchful eyes of guards ready to gun her down. She will travel to the city’s brightest highs and delve to its darkest depths on her journey, discovering her destiny among the last free people alive. White Shadows ’ striking architectural forms and stunning monochrome art style combine to create a place steeped in atmosphere. It’s a world where the lies of the elite are plastered across its walls, where twisted forms of entertainment are used to keep everyone in their place, and where hope seems in short supply. A visually stunning and narratively rich dystopian setting with a distinctive art style Varied puzzle platforming with unique scenarios that keep things fresh An exciting personal story combined with social critique A simple and intuitive control scheme",
