    "About the game": "Amnesiac Adventurer is a puzzle game with a twist: everything happens backwards! 'Unsolve' the puzzles and retrace your steps to restore the level back to how it originally was! Was a chest already looted, or a button already pressed? Perhaps an enemy had already been killed, or a trap already triggered? Don't leave any room for doubt! Everything you do and don't has repercussions down the line! - 25 hand crafted levels to start with more to come! - This game is mostly played backwards! Instead of solving puzzles normally, you are “un-doing” them! - The narrative choices in this game are 100% action based. Your actions determine the outcome of the story, not your dialogue choices. - Failing to solve the puzzle will affect the outcome/ending of the game. - Not completing a level properly doesn’t result in a game over, but rather, changes the narrative to fit the outcome. Greetings. We took a week off between the launch of Dying Flame, and then starting work on Amnesiac Adventurer. To be honest, we got bored and Amnesiac Adventurer started with an absurd proposition: Can we make a reverse puzzle game. Turns out, you can make one, as long as you don’t doubt yourself, and the creative process. Let’s just say we have spent too many nights awake testing puzzles and solving them until we didn’t know if we were coming-backwards or forward-going. We have no doubts that we’re going to keep you awake at night, with both puzzle solving and a story with diverse endings depending on how you unsolve the levels.",
