    "About the game": "Assignment 42 is a strategic, puzzle-based experience set in a maze of superstructure interiors. Progress by programming a robot to handle fried electrics and fires while you, with the guidance of your partner operator, evacuate every civilian and investigate who is behind the disaster. Use your robot to contain hazards and clear a path to various objectives. Each level poses a set of challenging puzzles for you to solve. Use your creativity to find new ways and guide your robot to its destination. Reroute circuits and secure a path to any remaining survivors and help them exit the danger zone safely. Program your robot to help you achieve your goals. Use a powerful node-based program editor to give your robot the brains to help you complete your assignments. Even if you have never programmed before you will pick up the basic concepts easily. Each level poses a new set of interesting challenges and puzzles. Work together with your robot to solve even the trickiest conundrums. Explore and pull back the plaster-board walls. The voice in your earpiece - Linnea - notices there’s something… off. Something extra behind the emergency, behind the thin interior walls and the servers. Something which might suggest this assignment... was no accident. You are Marcus, and as you control him and his buddying robot, it’s your objective to clear the buildings and get everybody out. And fast! Preferably at least. Strategize, check your map, and listen to your witty base operator – Linnea. Connect the nodes and program your pretty, mustard-coloured machine to extinguish the most inconvenient fires, reroute power, unlock doors and tear down walls all the while you round up anyone who is trapped and hastily guide their behinds out the exit. Explore the innards of not one, but three of 2042 Stockholm’s most impressive superstructures in this little serious, lots hilarious, self-aware near-ish future. London, Singapore, New York – when all eyes and all bets were on those bigger cities, Stockholm rose. And now… it’s beginning to fall.",
