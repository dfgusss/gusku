    "About the game": "Blind Battle Championship is a strategy turn-based tabletop fighting game , where the characters are blindfolded, so you will need to use your skills and intuition in order to defeat your enemies. At the start of every round, players have a limited time to choose up to 15 movements. When the time ends, all characters put on a blindfold and execute those movements at the same time. There are 7 different classes of characters and every one of them has unique skills with differents effects and costs. So, in every round, players must predict the position and movements of the opponents based on their skills and the environment in order to attack them. You only have one life, so if you get hit, you get eliminated. The last one standing will get the victory. You can play solo battles for up to 8 fighters , or in local multiplayer for up to 4 players . Choose between any of the 7 playable characters, every one of them with unique habilities that will be useful in every one of the 8 stages available: The Warrior , a soldier of the King's Guard, with sword, shield and bow, what makes her a very versatile fighter. The Barserker , a strong mercenary who carries a heavy axe with which performs devastating shield-breaker attacks.
