    "About the game": "It's a simple concept, get the DVD to the corner of the screen. The feeling of joy once you get it there is what makes this game so fun and addicting. Bouncing DVD: The Game is based on a bygone tech where you put silver circles into a plastic box and you could watch movies! This system was brilliant and even more so of the discovery of a feature when the logo on the idle screen, would ... one in a blue moon, hit the corner of the screen. Thousands or flip phone recordings show the moment when this very event happens. Blah blah blah, that time is over ... UNTIL TODAY You probably know what we're talking about, the old-fashioned disk screensaver that NEVER comes in the corner! Fortunately, a new era has arrived, an era in which this is all possible. The player can control the direction of the disk using the 'A' and 'D' buttons. Try to get the logo in the corner as quickly as possible and hit the top of the leaderboard! Because of the limited controls it takes real skill and even a bit of luck. This game is a free to play time-waster. Enjoy it, loathe it and uninstall it. That's what we did!",
