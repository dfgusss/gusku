    "About the game": "Why is it called 'Bring Dad Home'? Because the game was inspired by my real experience. It was at the beginning of 2019, a dark night on a high month, and my dad just participated in socializing and drank too much. After getting out of the car, what only I can do is helping him walking home. I'm not strong, but dad had a huge body. It was okay at first, but gradually became physically weak and unable to help him later. My dad fell and got injured. He was taken to the hospital immediately by me. A few days later, our team participated in the 2019 Global 48-Hour Extreme Development Competition, and we got a question about family relationships-'What does home mean to you?' So, we hit it off right away, and 'Bring Dad Home' was born. After 48 hours, we won the 'Most Popular Game Award' in Guangzhou. At the end of 2019, 'Bring Dad Home' was selected for the Indie Prize finals. We hope that this game will not only bring joy to everyone, but also remind you of some interesting memories with your loved ones. The cool feeling of attacking: Extremely game difficulty : Various Characters: A variety of equipment and props are waiting for you to unlock:",
