    "About the game": "Introducing Brotate A casual platforming game where the controls are a little different. Rotate the screen to move your character to the exit. Navigate your way around the obstacles to find a safe path to the end. Avoid Traps Avoid the fire placed around the edges of the map Keys Some doors need keys to open to progress. Find these around the map to move to other areas Portals The exit isnt the only portal. Some portals can take you to new areas, but not always take you back. Bonus Levels Collect coins along the way. You may have enough to unlock bonus levels from the main screen. Save Progress Once a level is completed, the progress is saved so you never forget your place.",
