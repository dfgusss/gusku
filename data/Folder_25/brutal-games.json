    "About the game": "Brutal Games is a first-person shooter in which you have only one task - the last to stay alive! You start the game without any means of protection, and therefore you need as soon as possible to get yourself weapons and ammunition that are scattered around the level. The battle in the game takes place on a small island that is used specifically for competitions in the royal battle. Choose a landing point, collect weapons and ammunition, stay the last one alive! A lot of blood! Large selection of weapons! Ability to shoot opponents of limbs! Choose tactics of conducting fight! Dedicated server! Remember! The larger the gun - the smaller the limbs of the enemy! After all, this is not just a royal battle. These are brutal games!",
