However, some souls have unfinished business that needs to be settled before they can reincarnate. As the player, you will assist these souls by traveling to real-world locations in feudal Japan and fighting your way through dangerous dungeons filled with monsters and traps. Key Features: Pixel-Perfect Customization – Design your character’s appearance and equipment down to the individual pixel with the pixel editor! Once you’re done, share the data to let other players add them to their own game! Magic Circle Power – With the Magic Circle system, your allies can empower and protect your character! Assign artifacts and arrange them into formations to maximize your power and abilities. Madcap Multiplayer – Team up with your friends in Co-op Mode to take on dungeons, or compete in Versus Mode to collect the most points! Speed-run lovers can also try to secure a spot in the online leaderboards by clearing dungeons as fast as possible!",
