    "About the game": "What is Crescent Hollow? Crescent Hollow is an Action RPG, (2D Top Down Orthogonal). 'As above, so below, discover the mysteries of the hollow'. Step into the world of Anthropia where you can dynamically change the world environment. Will you help the empires of the world, or destroy them? Four different classes with unique stories, and around a dozen party units to summon at the barracks. (Build your own Empire, Custom Party, Deep character stories + Couch COOP) Crescent Hollow is handcrafted from the ground up with custom art, music, sound design, and code. There are currently 4 classes to choose from: Ninja, Dark Knight, Druid, and Airship Pirate. All 4 classes have unique custom animations, have their own unique intro story, and each class has many powers to unlock. Again, all 4 characters have their own intro stories (Chapter 1). Then it leads into (Chapter 2) where all main characters meet up and come together. Real-time action combat The Ninja and Airship Pirate have 4 melee attacks to unlock and the Dark knight and Druid have only 1 (Unlocked by default). Plenty of powers to unlock as you level up. Harvest items from plants, trees, enemies, etc. Craft potions from the alchemy station, cook food from the campfire. Gather wood, stone, and ore to build your empire from the ground up. The build system ties into the main story quest, after completing chapter 1 with any class you will unlock the build mode. Dynamic airship battle system that allows you to experience real-time combat in the skies. 30+ fully animated creatures in the game, some of them can be gained via quests and can be commanded with command scrolls, then summoned at the barracks. (*not all enemies can be turned into party units) When you buy command scrolls at the barracks, and then use a command scroll, it has a 15% chance of sucking the soul of special enemies in, then it turns into a command card. From there you can summon that particular creature at the barracks. Did we mention plenty of crazy bosses to fight! Three controllable party members called 'Party Units', mix and match them, level them up. The barracks buildings can be found in any major Empire or town, and is used to summon your party units. *Each class starts off with their own unique party units that either start with them based on quest or can be summoned at the barracks. Experience combat with up to four friends local COOP. About a dozen biomes, each highly detailed and fleshed out. Multiple overworld maps. Explore the islands of the seas and the skies. The day/night cycle is connected to a global clock. There is also a calendar that keeps track of the day of each month so that events can be triggered with a future release. As day turns into night it becomes especially dangerous as there are exclusive nighttime creatures that spawn all throughout the world. Complex, yet comprehensive stat system, complete with resists for player, party and enemy.
