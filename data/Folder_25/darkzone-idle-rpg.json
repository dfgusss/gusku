    "About the game": "Darkzone is a multiplayer idle RPG with a deep gear and loot system, constant progression, co-op boss raids, and an amazing community. Relax, idle, and level up, and also find deeper RPG mechanics than your average idle game. Perfect to have in the background while working, studying, watching Netflix, or while playing something else. Your adventure as an intergalactic bounty hunter is about to begin... Join Ka’ Nuun and his newly formed crime faction, NEMESIS, in an epic quest for vengeance! MAIN FEATURES • Cross-platform • Multiplayer Idle RPG • Exciting loot and gear system • Tactical turn-based combat • Auto and Auto-2x modes for idle combat • Live co-op boss fights • Collectible pets, weapons, and charms • Incremental and continuous progression • Guilds and Seasons • Trade gear and resources with other players • Deep itemization and gear crafting • Story and campaign • AFK Progress • Skins and cosmetics • No energy system • Absolutely no ads STORY-DRIVEN PROGRESS An epic adventure with constant progression and bounties, quests, and areas to explore, all while still having a central storyline and cutscenes which expand on the Darkzone’s story. EPIC CO-OP BOSS FIGHTS Form alliances with other bounty hunters and invite them to join you in real-time multiplayer co-op battles. EXCITING LOOT SYSTEM Build your bounty hunters with awesome gear via a loot system inspired by hack n’ slash PC classics like Diablo, Destiny, Torchlight, and Path of Exile. You can’t buy Chests or Gear, and forget about an energy system. Darkzone is all about slaying monsters, farming loot, and improving your gear to design that stat-perfect build. DEEP ITEMIZATION/BUILDS Fill your inventory and stash with Rare, Epic, and LEGENDARY biomech implants with sockets, mods, and sets to be built. Every build in the game is unique with thousands of potential build combinations, and make sure you can collect all of the Unique Legendaries in the game! RARE WEAPONS, CHARMS, PETS Slay powerful enemies and jump into co-op boss raids with other players to collect all of the weapons, charms, and pets available in the Darkzone! When you find the ideal weapon, pet, or charm for your build, level it up to get stronger! FAST-PACED AUTO BATTLES Teleport in and out of combat with ease and run a quick raid or mission in a battle system carefully designed for busy gamers. Emerge from the shadow and show what true bounty hunting legends are made of. CUSTOMIZABLE PLAY STYLES Build your bounty hunters to your exact liking. You can tank, go DPS, or go for a bruiser build...all depending on your gear, mods, pets, and charms. AFK &amp; IDLE PROGRESS Hire raiders and smugglers to work for you and earn loot while you are AFK. They’ll have materials, gear and resources waiting for you when you get back. PLAYER-TO-PLAYER TRADING Use the live chat to find other bounty hunters looking to trade in real-time or asynchronously. Send and receive offers, and counter them when you don’t think the deal is quite right. CUSTOMIZE YOUR LOOK Earn and purchase outfits, weapon skins, and avatars for your bounty hunters, and don't miss out on limited edition event cosmetics. UNIQUE 2D ART STYLE Darkzone is hand-drawn from the ground up. Beautiful 2D models and bone-based animations with a unique art style that combines comic, cartoon, and realism. There are enough games that have the exact same art style. We wanted to break the mold. CONSTANT CONTENT UPDATES An active, indie, development team with unique ideas coming hot through the pipeline. Much, much more coming soon in future updates. *** NOTE: Darkzone is brought to you by an indie team. The game is still in early access, but we’re working around the clock. If you find a bug, or issue, report it and we’ll sort it out as quickly as possible.",
