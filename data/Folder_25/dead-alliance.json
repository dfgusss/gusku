    "About the game": "Dead Alliance™ is a fast-paced, multiplayer first-person zombie shooter set in a post-apocalyptic world, where former military bases have been turned into the only remaining city-states. Build your squad and take strategic control of bases across maps infected with zombies, using the dead themselves as weapons against your opposing faction. Armed with a variety of loadouts that range from guns to pheromone grenades, you'll face off against enemy armies and gruesome, human-eating killers - all while attempting to capture and control as many bases as possible. The world is a wasteland, and your only hope for survival is to use the dead...or join them. • Frenzied Multiplayer Action. Play tight-knit 4v4, Capture and Hold, King of the Hill, Free for All, Team Deathmatch and more. • Seize the Dead. Think quick and strategically use zombies to distract, disable and attack your opponents. Utilize a variety of zMods including lures, pheromone grenades, and traps to get the zombies working for you! • Zombie-MOBA. Capture your opponent’s home base to win, maneuvering between lanes in a zombie jungle. • Solo Survival Mode. Face off against endless hordes of ravenous zombies, unlocking new maps as you progress. * • Single Player Ops. Test your mettle against the undead and AI opponents across varied objectives. * • Deep Customization. Upgrade abilities and loadouts, building an arsenal of high-powered shotguns, rifles, crossbows and more. * Dead Alliance™: Multiplayer Edition does not include single player content.",
