    "About the game": "DeadSigns is a first person action game with survival and tower defense features. This single player game is under active development and early access on Steam. Bugs, missing and unbalanced features are to expect! Playable in English, French and Corsican. Survive as long as possible and defend yourself against waves of mutant plants and demonic creatures. During the day, prepare for the night. When the night comes, fight until the day’s back. Go through many nights and beat a lot of monsters with style to earn points and get better weapons. Machine guns, grenade launchers and shotguns, but also bows, maces and swords, and even turrets, bombs and barriers. Soon, you’ll be able to modify your environment and base strategically… Stay alive long and fight back to get the best score in the end! And try hard again and again to climb in the worldwide ranking. We have a Discord community to receive feedback from our early players. We’d be happy to welcome you and your ideas! Thank you for your support &lt;3 DeadSignsTeam",
