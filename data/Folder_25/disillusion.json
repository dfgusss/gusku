    "About the game": "An odd tower filled with odd characters in lands you don't remember ever existed. almost like it's a dream? A first-person dungeon crawling RPG with turn-based combat and an emphasis on interacting with the characters around you. Heavily inspired by other games such as LSD dream emulator, eastern mind lost souls, amongst others. Appear with no memory in a land surrounding a bizarre tower drawing in all life with a strange urge to climb it. Climb the tower to gain an understanding of why you are here, the higher you go, the more you may understand. Branching paths and dialog can lead to different outcomes or uncover new areas to explore. Help others on their journey to climb, and have others help you. Featuring multiple endings, and paths.",
