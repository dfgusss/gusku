    "About the game": "You are a child of Light, but how bright are your intentions? You are descended to earth by the Divinest Light. Your past is unclear, but the Light gives you strength to proceed through the darkness of void. Embrace it and try to uncover the secrets of this monochromatic world. Divinest Light is a single player experience with an emphasis on original plot and shadow-avoidance game mechanics as the character can only survive under the Light. Divinest Light implements a seamless transition between the menu and gameplay to greatly increase immersion. Also, there is almost no text in Divinest Light - just a small informational hint in the main menu. Thus, everybody can play the game regardless of the language they speak.",
