    "About the game": "eden is a 3D Screensaver (not a game) with great graphics. Discover beautiful environments: From snow-covered Mountains to a day at a sunny Beach. Please note: eden is under active development, frequently receiving updates to content and functionality to customers free of charge! In other words: It is currently nowhere near finished, things are likely to change and everything might be a bit rough around the edges. If 'Early Access' isn't your thing at all, please consider not buying this software. Features so far Lovely handmade/detailed 3D environments Music and sounds matches every level (i.e stormy wind on the mountains, light breeze on the meadow) Easy to use, even for kids (it's also safe for kids) Planned future Features Workshop Integration - make your own environments and share them with the entire community Subject to change",
