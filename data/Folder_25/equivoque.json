    "About the game": "Equivoque is a visual novelette for daring children of all ages. Bundt Kuchen is the lone apprentice in a magic shop. They believe they’ll never get any closer to the magical world than manning the cash register until one day, famous magician, Mint the Splendid shows up at the door. Preaching the values of skepticism and a critical mind, Mint sends Bundt on an undercover mission to unmask a magician-turned-fraudulent-medium, named Barnabas. Now Bundt must learn to combat their indecisive nature and ask the right questions to free the public from Barnabas’s tricks and finally get a taste of being in control...but is Bundt really the one pulling the strings of their destiny? Step into Bundt's shoes and converse with the whacky and the dangerous cast of Equivoque, and remember, apprentice, to Question Everything.",
