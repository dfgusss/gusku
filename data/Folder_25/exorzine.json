    "About the game": "Exorzine is a hide and seek game inside a dungeon. The protagonist starts in a locked dungeon cell. Exorzine is walking around the dungeon and will try to stop the protagonist from escaping. Exorzine is a half goat, half human zombie. Her consciousness consists 100 % out of possession. Only an exorcism can help her. The dungeon has many obstacles which make it not easy to escape (locked doors, gates, movable walls and traps). Some places in this dungeon are hidden. There are places around to hide (chests, wardrobes, beds, barrels and a cage). Useful items and collectables around the dungeon help you to find a way to escape from the dungeon. Find potion ingredients around in the dungeon to make a magic potion for a zombie which will give you a key for a lock that you can find at one of the celldoors. There is a exorcism book located in the game that must be found, but its required to collect the 5 swords around the dungeon before the exorcism book can be collected. When you make noises and if Exorzine hear that noises, she will go to that place. Exorzine wins when she stoped the protagonist 100 times from escaping the dungeon, but she will need 100 times again when the protagonist enters a new level. Gameplay can include jumpscares, triggered from sudden appearance of moving NPCs.",
