    "About the game": "oh hi!! are you the Prince?? the reaper?? the HERO!!?? thwap!! thwap!! i sure hope you are!! because we need SOMEONE to help us grow our trees!! thwap!! thwap!! every time we try, the TITAN Nidhogg uses them to flip out!! so we have to keep gnawing them down!! but i'm sure if you plant just a FEW trees it will be fine?? Farragnarok is a mysterious set of lands, starting with the Land of Horticulture and Essence (LOHAE). LOHAE is a peaceful tree growing simulation game with definitely no secrets. Taking on the mythological role of a Reaper of Life, you must Choose whether to destroy life, or to destroy using the power of life. You can also enjoy the demo of the Land of Mists and Trails, an 'Oregon Trail' like game where you ferry the souls of the dead to their final resting place. Future lands will include features such as: a tower defender, a word puzzle, a procedural story generator, a walking simulator, and a city building game. All will be woven together by a thread of narrative significance, sometimes subtle, gradually growing more and more relevant. Don't worry about that 'essence' bullsh**t. Who even cares about it? Not smart Players like you. The Sleeping Serpent? Never heard of 'em. Must not have made it into this version of the game. You found a flashlight? Weird. Probably doesn't do anything. Features: Fully Procedural Trees and Fruit Descriptions Plant trees. Pick fruit. Hybridize fruit and trees together. ?? Definitely no secrets.",
