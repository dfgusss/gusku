    "About the game": "A year has passed since the epic battle that decided the fate of mankind and claimed the life of the beloved Angela. Dark omens once again tell of the return of an evil presence. Ushi is the last remaining master of the ancient art of Shin-Ken, and he calls upon Tetsuo, his disciple and adopted son, to investigate some strange happenings in a faraway farming village outside the city. 16 years since the first release of an epic game like Gekido Kintaro's Revenge on Gameboy Advance. Naps Team wanted to bring back this Gekido chapter to its original players and possibly to new public to discover a timeless classic. -2 player co-op play -Different resolution modes to play and explore both the original levels and the new ones. -New soundtrack. -New cutscenes. -2 completely new game modes. -Tons of video/audio options and original against new assets options to customize your experience. -Fully configurable and fully supported controllers. -Survival mode where 1 or 2 players can proceed through a wide variety of completely new levels just wildly punching and kicking to survive hordes of enemies and tough bosses. -Rogue-like relic hunter mode where again 1 or 2 players can cooperatively explore procedurally generated dungeons to find ancient reliqs and collect them.",
