    "About the game": "You're in a tavern in the woods, but someone is a necromorph hungry for human meat. Guillotine the necromorph, or get eaten alive. Guillotine is a multiplayer game of lying and deceit, with a pinch of survival. It can be played with 4-18 players. VOICE CHAT: Proximity based voice chat. Sing at the piano, or scream for help when the necromorph is hunting you. ROUNDS: The game round has 3 phases: Gather - Run around the forest, grabbing food and resources. Discuss - The fog of death starts to rise up. Time to come back to the tavern, craft equipment and discuss. Vote - Vote a player to get guillotined. HUNGER: Necromorphs have to kill people to satisfy their hunger. Humans have to find food in the forest. Food growing plants are scattered in the forest, but most of them are located around the giant vines. MATERIALS: Materials can be collected around the map. They are used to craft items and upgrade equipment. ZEPPELIN: Humans can call a zeppelin by depositing the materials on its call table. Once all the required materials are there, the zeppelin will fly into the tavern's tower and rescue whoever gets in it. If any player manages to escape alive, it is a human victory.",
