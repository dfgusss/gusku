    "About the game": "This is johns.game, a Wasteland Survival Game. You are here on Naben, a cold desert wasteland full of criminal activity, death, and loneliness. After fighting off the people who killed your only family you find yourself having nothing left but the two hands in front of you. The world is quickly taking a darker turn. People will die, blood will lay ways to the surface of the orange, gray earth. The world will burn under your feet as the people around you fear you. You are John, a man with a cliche name and a hidden story of ethics. You don't care, you control someone with no morals and he will do anything. John... he will burn the world down, break every bone, slaughter every child, and find his truth. Do you want to know what happens in the end? John dies. Everyone dies in the end, it's just the hard truth. I am speaking to you, I just wish you would listen. Included Features: Some features that have batteries included: Minipulation; In-Depth Questing; Guns; Farming; Cooking; Fire; Death; Explosions; Deadly Shovels; Sexy Ambient Music; More Death; Towns &amp; Locations; Weapons &amp; Vehicles; Unique People; MUCH MUCH MORE!; HOW HAVE YOU NOT BOUGHT THIS YET?!; . Extra info from here down If you find a bug or have something you think would be a good fit, please feel free to message the dev directly, complain on Twitter or just post in the disscusions in the community hub. The game is moderately complicated and involves a lot of thought. There are real world aspects (for example, lighting a fire using fire, breaking a snowman gives you snow, etc.) for a slightly more realistic tone. This game is pretty community driven in the sense that if you want something you just ask.",
