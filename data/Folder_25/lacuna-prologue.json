    "About the game": "/ Lacuna: Prologue tasks you – CDI agent Neil Conrad – with investigating the murder of a high-profile victim whose death could plunge the solar system into war. Solve the first in a series of connected cases that lead you deeper and deeper into the conspiracy at the core of this captivating 2D sci-fi noir adventure. Don't forget to wishlist the full game Lacuna , which will be released this summer. Another cigarette tumbles into the abyss. The sun is slowly coming up, glistening in the sea of buildings below. I look up at the stars one last time before they disappear. They don't provide any guidance. They don't give a f*ck. I have to make this decision on my own, and very soon. Problem is, I don't know how. I've never been able to figure out why I do what I do. Not really. No more time to think. I have to go. Here's the deal You are Neil Conrad, CDI agent. Awoken by the news of a murder, you rush into a case that will soon turn your life and the whole solar system upside down. Ask questions, collect evidence, and put the pieces together until the ugly truth reveals itself... or not. No takebacks The story branches and ends based on your actions. There's no going back. Sure, you can rush your way to the end – if you don't mind paying the price. Play your cards right, and you might make it out alive. How far will you go? Some questions don't have a right answer. Will you sell out a friend to protect your family? Will you endanger a loved one in exchange for public safety? Will you keep the peace or reveal the horrible, world-shattering truth? Hungry for Point &amp; Click Adventure? While the classics were great in their time, Lacuna does away with the baggage of many adventure game tropes: Pointing &amp; clicking Platformer movement controls (WASD / controller) Selecting all dialog options one by one anyway Non-repeating conversations and choices Inventory management and counter-intuitive puzzles Immersive, story-driven mysteries Pixel hunting Optional outlines on anything interactable Story grinds to a halt at every puzzle can always be driven forward 'x will remember this' Real choices and multiple endings",
