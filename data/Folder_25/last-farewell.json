    "About the game": "The Game Last Farewell is a survival co-op game. You and up to 3 other players have sought refuge in the Town Hall of the city and barricaded yourselves within walls and a gate. From here on you're tasked with scavenging for resources, improve your defenses, and explore during the day. When night comes, the town hall will need to be defended from a wave of enemies and for each night you survive, the attackers grow in numbers... Rebuild Arm yourselves with makeshift weapons, construct defensive contraptions and device a plan of action, watch each other's backs while you do your best to last as long as possible during the apocalypse! Experience As you live and die, your soul will grow in experience, unlocking new crafting recipes and experiences in Last Farewell, which will both make your next attempt easier... and more dangerous.",
