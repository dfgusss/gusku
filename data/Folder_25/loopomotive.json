    "About the game": "Sloths driving trains? An unstoppable train stuck in an endless loop? Cars that mindlessly drive through level crossings? What the h-? It doesn't make any sense! Welcome to the colorful world of Loopomotive, a small casual game that is entirely free &amp; easy to play. There are no rules and no complex game mechanics, Loopomotive is a wholesome and relaxing game with a simply mechanic, a joyful soundtrack and cute graphics to brighten your day. Spot the curious peeking sloths as you go through 15 unique levels set in a variety of sceneries. How to play: You drive a train that is stuck in a loop and is unable to fully stop: You can only accelerate, slow down and occasionally use the emergency brake (when it is fully charged). Levels in Loopomotive are completed by either running a pre-defined number of loops around the track, surviving until the end of a countdown, or letting a number of cars pass through the tracks safely. You lose the level if you hit a vehicle and cause any accidents. Just one accident is too many. (Come on, you don't want to make the sloths sad, do you?) What you can do: Explore 15 levels with unique sceneries, from the underground to the outer space Find adorable sloths hidden in each level Unlock multiple game achievements that add replayability Pimp your ride and have the coolest train (possibly in the entire world) with unlockable custom skins",
