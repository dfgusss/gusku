    "About the game": "Can you guess the Math Expression in 6 tries? After each try you get notified if the digit is correct, if the digit is present in the expression but in the wrong place, or if the digit is not present at all; Sorry for messing with the commutative property! So 2+3=5 is not the same as 3+2=5 here (more about it on the forum); Play it daily to maximize your score! Think of it as a routine game to stretch your brain in the morning; Skimming description? READ THIS: After Rank 3, you can still play the game for free, one rank per day. Or buy a really really cheap DLC to remove this limitation; Challenge yourself in increasingly difficult expressions as you increase your rank; Track your meaningful stats as you progress; Compare your performance with other players on our worldwide leaderboard! Be sure to try out the amazing games that inspired the creation of MATH EXPRESSions: Master Mind &gt; WORDLE &gt; NERDLE &gt; MATH EXPRESSions",
