    "About the game": "ABOUT THIS GAME Welcome to Myst: a starkly beautiful island, eerily tinged with mystery and shrouded in intrigue. Journey to Myst Island and other stunning, long dormant locations - called “Ages”- and begin to unravel the mystery you have been thrust into. As you learn what happened on the island, you will find that you are playing a key role in an epic story whose ending has not yet been written. Explore deeper connections in these stunning and surreal Ages, uncover a story of ruthless family betrayal, and make choices that will affect both you, and the world of Myst itself. Cyan, the indie studio that created the beloved classic, has reimagined Myst. Built from the ground up to play both in VR as well as traditional flatscreen displays, Myst is teeming with new art, new sound, re-imagined interactions, and even optional puzzle randomization. Finally... the highly anticipated Myst 2D/VR experience has arrived! Now you can explore the Ages of Myst in a new dimension! BUILT FOR BOTH VR AND 2D DISPLAYS Designed and built from the ground up in Unreal Engine, this newly-reimagined version of Myst includes fresh takes on the visuals in every area in the game. With both VR and 2D play experiences in mind, this definitive, modern edition of Myst will immerse you in the world in a way that has never been possible before. The VR experience includes both Free Roam and Teleport modes, and supports Valve Index, HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, Rift S, and Quest via Oculus Link. Additionally, Myst includes many “comfort level” features for both new and experienced VR users, including the option to enable smooth or snap turning, quick travel up stairs and ladders, vertical height quantization, and more! NEW AND REQUESTED FEATURES For the first time in Myst’s history, enjoy the game in many different languages through localized UI, including dialogue and gameplay-context subtitles. - A variety of accessibility options to assist in gameplay. - Tired of taking notes? Now you can take photo captures in-game to keep track of what you’ve encountered! - A large number of graphics options to choose from, such as supersampling options and Ray Tracing to bring the best Myst experience out of the hardware you have. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q: Do I need a VR headset to play Myst? A: You do not need a VR headset to play Myst. Myst is playable with or without a VR headset. Q: Which VR headsets do you support? A: Please see our “About” section for the VR headsets we support. Q: I bought Myst when it first came out in 1993. Can I get a free upgrade to this new version? A: Thank you for your support over the years! We are not giving out free upgrades to previous purchasers of the original Myst. We put a lot of effort into making this new version of Myst and would appreciate your financial support again! Q: How do I launch Myst in VR? A: You may launch Myst in VR through the VR launch options given to you when you start the game through the store platform. If you are launching through a shortcut on your computer and not through a storefront, we recommend adding the following flags to a shortcut (without quotes): “-vr -d3d11” Q: I want to play Myst, but am concerned about my computer not meeting the minimum requirements. What should I do? A: If your machine does not meet the minimum requirements and you still want to try Myst out, we recommend enabling one of our supersampling options through the graphics settings menu to see if it alleviates performance concerns. Depending on the storefront you purchase Myst from, you may be able to qualify for a refund through the store (not through Cyan support) if Myst does not run well on your platform. Please review each store platform refund policy for details. Q: Will Myst support [insert language here] one day? A: Possibly! We’d love to hear from you through our support team about any languages you’d like for us to support.",
