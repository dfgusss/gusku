They enjoyed a fabulous day together filled with stunning rollercoaster rides, spectacular shows and lots of fun. While having a break at Balthasar Castle they step on a hidden trap door and are falling into the underground of the castle. Below the castle they get lost in a mysterious maze of forgotten dungeons. They are all alone but they know they can escape only together. Watch out the 'Nightgrabber' on the way out, that is trying to keep them in the dungeon and putting obstacles into their way.
