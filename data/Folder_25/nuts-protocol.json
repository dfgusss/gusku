    "About the game": "Nuts Protocol is a fast-paced Tower Defense game. Instead of spamming weaponry out and about, your major duty is to surgically and wisely position and reposition the Turrets you have to hit the jackpot. KEY FEATURES The protagonist is an orange Squirrel! And he's the one in charge of moving, placing, and replacing your Turrets! Cool, right? You're always moving. As we mentioned - this is a fast-paced Tower Defense game. The better you react, the better the outcomes will be. Decisions matter. Would you rather purchase a new Turret or upgrade the good old Gatling Gun you purchased 2 minutes ago? The game has no story, but bad decisions will lead you to your fall. Puzzle-like maps. Each map requires you to think differently. Recycling strategies might not always work, so you have to decipher the patterns! Gore! I mean, quite cartoony, but still - gore! When you kill your foes, you're going to see them explode... a bath of blood and body parts! Easy to learn, hard to master. The basics are easy, but mastering the mechanics to hit the Flawless status demands you some experience. #gitgud",
