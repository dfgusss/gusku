On an island in the Gulf of Mexico, a secret space project was carried out; however, it was canceled for unknown reasons and the staff left the island. Two years later, five engineers returned to the island to do research. One night one of them wakes up hearing strange noises and realizes that his companions have disappeared. Explore a huge map in an immersive experience thanks to great lighting, sound effects and fog effects. Face terrifying enemies from another planet who want to stop you at all costs and prevent you from fulfilling your goal. Defend yourself in frantic battles with enemies using the weapons you will find on the island, explore dark corridors and abandoned buildings, solve puzzles to access new areas and use the objects you find in the environment to progress in your adventure.",
