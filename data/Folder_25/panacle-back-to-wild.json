    "About the game": "Panacle: Back to the Wild is a indie card game developed by one person. The game not only combines the best of War Chess, roguelike, Building Deck, but also has an original 'Tactical Position' game mechanic, and a series of characters and cards designed with the 'Tactical Position' mechanic as the core. In terms of worldview and story, I will try to create a different kind of hardcore sci-fi future world for you, maybe it's not that exciting, but maybe it will make you unheard of and refreshing. In the game, you will play as a battlefield commander and have the freedom to build your squad, tactics and command decks. Then you can experience the following gameplay modes. 1. Story mode: random map routes, random enemies, and partially random side storys based on roguelike gameplay. The story will be presented in chapters, within a chapter, your squad, tactics and deck will be temporarily locked and cannot be edited or replaced, and failure in any level will result in failure of the entire chapter. Therefore, you need to choose the appropriate recommended route to complete the chapter based on your enemy information and your own situation. 2. Exploration mode: Endless mode based on the Building Deck of play, you will get the opportunity to build and adjust your team, tactics and deck after each victory, and constantly strengthen your team as a whole. Likewise, as the game progresses, enemies will continue to gain strength, and it is impossible to predict exactly what enemies you will encounter on your next round of exploration. It is worth mentioning that you can not only get the characters and cards you have collected during the exploration process to build a temporary team, but even if you do not get the characters and cards, there is also a chance that they will join your temporary team. 3. Training mode: Here you can quickly experience various pre-defined squads, tactics and command decks, even if you don't have them in your collection. In addition you can also customize various combat parameters to test your various ideas. 4. Trust system: This is the only extra-battle training system in this game. After you collect a character, every time you lead him to battle, it will strengthen your trust relationship, and when the trust level is high enough, your partner can randomly gain some extra abilities in the battle. 5. Weather system: In the Story and exploration mode, we have added a weather system, which can not only be reflected in the combat performance, but also affect the trend of a battle. Weather system follows certain established rules and randomly appear. 6. Props system: In the Story and exploration mode, we have added many small props to enhance your combat experience or help you get out of trouble. We will continue to develop and launch various games such as 'achievement system', 'dress up system' and so on to continuously enrich our game. Of course, our core content: tactical positions, characters and command cards will be continuously developed and launched, so you can give full play to your imagination and build various combinations to experience. We sincerely look forward to meeting you in the world of 'Panacle'!",
