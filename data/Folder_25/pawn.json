Rumours and hearsays, strange behaviors and hidden secrets reveal a darker side of the city where the inhabitants are being preyed upon by a serial killer. What seems like an ideal job opportunity will soon become a race against the clock to prevent dramatic events to unfold. The last week of the semester might very well be your last week. Will you manage to make the right decisions and solve the case ? Beware, innocence might be nothing but a mere illusion.
