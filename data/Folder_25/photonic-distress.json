    "About the game": "Photonic Distress (or PD for short) is a blend of First/Third Person puzzler/platformer with a unique twist. You wake up in an internal representation of your conscience where your goal is to collect 100 memory fragments throughout increasingly complicated and increasing in size levels, or dreams. But there is a catch! These levels are not illuminated. You have a Photon gun that you can use to light your way up as you go through these levels. Initially this is only in form of colorful balls, or photons, that your shoot from your gun, and they light up a certain area. As you collect fragments, the upgrades will become available for you, such as a flashlight attachment, a scan grenade - that shows an outline of the world around you and highlights points of interest, and others. Once you collect 100 fragments the final room will open where you can go to end the game. To provide maximum replayability, level generation is based of a Pseudo Random Number Generator. The seed you choose or randomly generate when starting a new game will dictate how your levels look, what they are made of, how many fragments you will find in each level and etc. This means that you can complete the game on various difficulties for the same seed, or various seeds for the same difficulty and every time it will look different. PD features 4 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Impossible. Based on your chosen difficulty your gameplay may be quite relaxing as you quickly go through levels or very challenging. The tiles that make up your level have a difficulty rating from 1 to 10. On easy, the difficulty rating increases every 10 levels, on impossible - every 2 level. As the difficulty keeps increasing you will find that the levels will be made up with tiles that are increasingly trickier. We have to admit higher level tiles give even the calmest of us an urge to smash something. Levels also gradually increase in size - more so with chosen difficulty. There is also an assortment of various barricades, traps and pickups that will also spawn for you. Most of the music ingame was composed specifically for PD, by a very talented friend of ours, Toteki. However you are welcome to turn it off through settings and put some of your own chillout (or adrenaline pumped) music in the background. Overall we aim to provide a mystique filled ambiance with just the right challenge level for you to spend your time. PD was made by a very small team. We are as indie as it gets. it's our first game and we sincerely hope it is worth your time and money.",
