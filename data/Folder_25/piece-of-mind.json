    "About the game": "How long can you survive? Piece Of Mind is an open world sandbox that puts a unique spin on first and third person shooter, survival, and resource management games. You will need to decide who gets fed first, you or your dog? Together you will go through various challenges and sickness, and try to survive the harsh environment and unpredictable climate. How will you survive this vast place with dangerous animals and roaming soldiers with tactical weaponry? GAME FEATURES Explore - A huge Island with rich and unique environments filled with different kinds of wildlife at every turn. Companion - You travel with your dog - win its' trust and it will protect you and warn you of danger. Heal its sicknesses, feed it and protect it while it protects a piece of your mind. Sickness - A wide variety of infections and sicknesses that will make surviving a lot more challenging. You can share resources with your trusted companion in the unforgiving forest. Temperature - Temperature changes based on the climate, the time of day and the current season. Cooking of food -Cooking is essential for survival and will protect you from various diseases. Wild Life - A diverse wildlife with all kinds of predators, both at sea and on land. Survival Mechanics - Hunger, thirst, blood, fatigue, health and stamina. Health and blood - As close to real as it can get; you don't lose health based on physical damage but the environment, insects and wildlife are a threat. E.g a snake bite will only poison you and won't take your health. When you are shot, stabbed with knives, bitten by predators etc you will lose both blood and health. Excessive loss of blood leads to death. Beware of blood type sicknesses. AI Army - Take care when attacking unless you are well equipped to do so, like having different types of tactical strength. Beware of guerrilla warfare. DISCLAIMER (PLEASE READ) The Public Early Access is intended for those interested in supporting the project and participating in its continued development. You will most likely experience balancing issues, performance issues, bugs and missing features. If you are looking for a complete gaming experience I would recommend for allowing some time before trying the game. We are a team of two and to those who will join us in the journey, we will be constantly adding new features that will improve the experience. Thank you and enjoy.",
