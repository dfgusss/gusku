    "About the game": "It's Saturday, 1992. Probably late evening, perhaps 6 or so. You are a little kid, sitting on your bed, wrapped in a blanket with your 'Game Kid' handheld device (not backlit) and play your favorite games while your mother brings you some hot cocoa. You don't know it yet but this is the best life will ever be. This feeling, the feeling of playing those handheld games back in the day, this is what Pixel Pileup Party is all about. This game collection includes four new 'Game Kid' styled games in one package, so that you can feel like a child again. Unless of course that kid never was you, in that case you'll encounter four great games styled after a 90s retro device. One way or the other, you'll get some awesome games is what I'm saying. --------------------------------------------------- About the games: Chibi Ninja-Kun The ancient scrolls of the Ninja's way have been stolen and it is up to you to get them back. Fight your way through dangerous enemies, defeat tough bosses and try not to die out there. Old school retro platforming action awaits in this tough as nails adventure. Are you Ninja enough to survive? Donion VS Bad Hombres Donald the orange onion is furious. Bad Hombres are infiltrating his beautiful wall (the best wall there ever is, so good, winning) thinking that, because he wants them to pay for it, it belongs to them. Foolish vegetables. SAD! Help Donion get rid of the bad fruit by doing what Donald does best: Bumbling into them and tripping over himself. But beware: Some hombres are strong, yo! Puzzle KING MAN The King Man is at it again - but this time for the first time! Again! How exciting! Puzzling! Retroing! Fun for the whole family, as long as you are alone, because this game is single player only! Puzzle KING MAN? YES! The only game that has ever truly been and shall forever be 100% apolitical! eXtreme Rider RETRO Every ten years, a competition is held by the planetary government to find the best speedcycle rider on the planet. Many riders from all around the globe participate to find out who is the most extreme rider of them all. It’s not a question if you’ll die. It’s about how far you’ll get before the inevitable happens! --------------------------------------------------- Arbitrary list of features in no particular order: Collecting 4 different 8-Bit Retro Handheld styled games Match-3, platformer, endless runner and metroidvania in one package Modern features like colors and game saves (yes, really) 4 shades of green Chiptunes. Who doesn't love chiptunes Each game has its own shades of green for some reason Unique gameplay experiences for every game All games have hidden graphic modes you can unlock in case yo don't like green that much eXtreme Rider RETRO has online highscores ------------------------------- Controller Information: Due to limitations with the engine, some controllers, for example 8bitdo gamepads, may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard. I apologize for the inconvenience.",
