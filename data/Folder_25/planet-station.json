    "About the game": "Planet Station - is a classic 3D action-shooter like Sci-Fi in which you play as an ex sheriff Margaret. The main aim is to survive. By the will of fate, Margaret had to move to another planet and she could hardly imagine what the result would be… While long-lasting flight, her spaceship crushed and fell down on an uninhabited planet. Waking up, she realized she was the only survived person. Margaret would try to look for help and the way from the black hole. The main aim of the game is looking for definite things which will help you to stay alive and leave the planet. Don’t think it’s easy. You will meet various monsters. They want you to die. Look for guns, ammo, aids and different helping notes. At the end, you can do it! Remember – if you don’t kill, you will be killed. Good luck in fight!",
