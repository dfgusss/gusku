    "About the game": "ZOMBIES CAN MAKE YOU THINK BETTER The least boring brain trainer in the world. Most brain training programs are dull mini-games. Even when they work well, the player quickly loses interest in playing. PROJECT AZRIEL has been shown to increase fluid intelligence and it’s fun to play. Who doesn’t want to take down some zombies while training their brain to work better? In a study sponsored by the Office of Naval Research, people who played our game increased their fluid intelligence score by 5 points on average. 'Fluid intelligence (is) the capacity to solve novel problems, to learn, to reason, to see connections and to get to the bottom of things.' - Dan Hurly, New York Times Do you play a lot of games? Being able to recognize patterns and solving new kinds of problems faster is what makes the difference between a good gamer and a great gamer. You do want to be a great gamer… don’t you? FEATURES &amp; BENEFITS • Improve your fluid intelligence while taking down zombies • Rigorous brain training activities integrated with the gameplay • Adaptive brain training and gameplay difficulty levels • Re-do missions or the entire campaign while keeping current experience points &amp; difficultly levels • Toggle between 1st &amp; 3rd person cameras for a different gameplay experience • Adaptive depth-of-field player camera for a more cinematic feel OUR STORY We’re a small scrappy little indie company that has been developing learning applications for over 15 years. At Curriculaworks, we care about helping people to achieve more through the use of targeted, research-based applications. We’ve helped over 200K students learn to read and now we’re excited to be leading the way in the field of cognitive improvement through our development of this new type of brain training application that is both fun and gets serious results. We’ll use some of the proceeds of Project Azriel to develop a similar FPS brain-training game that is more age appropriate for children and to provide that game to students with learning disabilities free of charge. So, your purchase of PROJECT AZRIEL will help us to help others. We’re doing an Early Access release to help us further refine our brain training application with the immense feedback of the Steam Community. Together we can make brain training impactful and fun. THE RESEARCH PROJECT AZRIEL is the outcome of five years of research and development sponsored by the U.S. Office of Naval Research to create a rigorous cognitive trainer that is robust enough to generate transferable gains in fluid intelligence and compelling enough to get reluctant trainees to engage in the training outside of a lab environment. PROJECT AZRIEL currently integrates three cognitive training tasks targeting working memory updating, mental set switching, and attentional inhibition in a deeply engaging first person shooter video game. THE STUDY A randomized, blinded study with more than 165 subjects was completed to determine impact of gameplay on cognitive transfer measures. The evaluation showed that the game was effective at improving fluid intelligence, a finding that replicates lab studies reported in the cognitive training literature. Fluid Intelligence A significant interaction emerged between the within person factor (pretest to posttest) and the experimental condition on fluid intelligence (F(1, 124) = 7.19, p &lt; .01, η2 = .06). While both the experimental group and the control group improved on the fluid intelligence test from pretest to posttest, the experimental group improved significantly more than the control group. This interaction is depicted below:",
