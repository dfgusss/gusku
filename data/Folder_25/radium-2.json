    "About the game": "Radium 2 is a physics based skill game with puzzle elements, inspired by the smallest elementary particles of our universe. The core of the game is to navigate a ball through the different levels, controlling and influencing it by two tractor beams. The polarization change, one of the main mechanics in the game, is simple but challenging. Through contact with a specific object, the gravitation is reversed, the interface turns yellow and the tractor beams push the ball away, instead of attracting it. Features: • 130 Level • Zooming, scrolling and rotating level sections • Leaderboards for each level • Speedrun mode • Original soundtrack with 13 tracks",
