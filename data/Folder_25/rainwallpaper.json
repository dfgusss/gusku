RainWallpaper uses hardware acceleration for videos for optimal performance unlike most video players. This means that your graphics card drivers may influence the way videos look.You need to reset the video options in your graphics control panel for your Nvidia/AMD/Intel graphics card to fix this. If you have a laptop, make sure to reset it for all of them. You can also reinstall the driver and choose to reset all settings ('clean re-installation') to do this, this is possible with Nvidia's drivers, for example. If your drivers do not offer you to perform a clean re-installation, first uninstall your old drivers and then install the new graphics card drivers. 2. Make sure Windows Media Player is installed and open the wallpaper video in Windows Media Player. Q: Why can not display desktop icons? A: 1. Please add RainWallpaper EXE and Path to your AntiVirus Software's Trust-White-List and Restart computer 2. Make sure your Windows had enabled Aero",
