It gives the player the ability to choose and get slightly different results. The game has many mysteries you might want to uncover. The game is free with no in-game transactions. All assets are made by the developers. The play-time can last up to 15-25 minutes, depending on individuals. FAQ: Does This Game Contain Screamers? While it is best for you to find out yourself, There is nothing that is extremely considered a 'screamer'. Does this game have weapons? A survival horror game? Not a survival horror game. No weapons. Are there Saves? There is no save system due to it being a fairly short game. Epilepsy Warning? Theres a extremely low chance you can get your epilepsy triggered from this. So it is fine.
