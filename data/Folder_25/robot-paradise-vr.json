    "About the game": "You are using a robot to get medication from the laboratory. You can control the walking with bowing your head and turning your body. In the turret level you have to shoot with your voice! Your friends can use the city map to guide you. Share your VR adventure gameplay in this huge science fiction environment and try to see all endings! Features: VR walking with head movement no controlers needed Voice recognition during the game and shooting level Secret levels and different endings Open world sci-fi continent. Will expand in updates Great synthwave soundtrack from Waveshaper, Leeroy Thornhill (exProdigy) and many more Recommendation: We recommend to play the game in standing position (bowing the head slightly down to move forward and turn your whole body in the VR environment), with a VR Device and Headset (Headphone and Microphone) to have the best result for walking and using the voice recognition controls. We also recommend to download the City Map (PDF) and let the player guide by someone. Anyhow its not a neccesery thing to finish the game. We hope you will enjoy our product!",
