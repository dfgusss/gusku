    "About the game": "Serpent Fusion is a difficult puzzle game based on the classic game Snake where you grow by attaching boxes to your back, not by eating food. Additionally, you are not forced to move forward—you also gain the ability to stand still and move backwards. This allows you to stick to boxes by reversing into them, along with many other effects. In the latter half of the 60+ levels offered, three different colors of boxes and color checking gates are added, expanding the scope of the puzzles. My brother Kepler provided the sound effects and music to my game—this was the first time his music was included in a bigger project. I’m a sixteen-year old, and made this game as a hobby while in high school. I made my game free because I want people to try it. If you try my game, I hope you enjoy it!",
