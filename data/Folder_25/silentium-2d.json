    "About the game": "Feeling a little nostalgic? Is your Dad wanting to play video games with you, but generally sucks at games made after 2005? Welcome to Silentium 2D, a local, splitscreen game which pits you and a friend (soon to be enemy) against eachother in 1v1 arcade combat! Fight your foe in the city, the field, or even the freakin' moon! (Yes, the moon!) Gameplay is *loosely* inspired by the Halo franchise (Silentium 2D does not use any Halo/343/microsoft assets), and features classical, arcade gameplay! Best of all, it's affordable, fun, and can be played offline with a friend! The controls are remarkably easy to use, and allows for anyone to play! By purchasing Silentium 2D, you support Frentwick Indie in making future titles, and updating this one! We hope to see you on the virtual battlefield ;)",
