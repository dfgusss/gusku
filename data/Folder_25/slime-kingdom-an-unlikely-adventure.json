The world is just like any RPG world with heroes, demon kings, dragons, etc and our gooey little friend has to overcome them. He'll need some help to avoid being a smear on some adventurer's boot. Can he recruit a strong enough team to help him accomplish his almost impossible goal? Series FEATURES Meet quirky and hilarious characters on you journey.
