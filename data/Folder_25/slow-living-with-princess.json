    "About the game": "Having been banished from the party of the Heroine, on their quest to defeat the Demon Lord, Red has retired from the front lines and opened an apothecary in the frontier land of Zoltan. Now his happy new life depends on his relationships with a former tsundere princess, and his cute little sister, Ruti, who, as the Heroine, remains the world's only hope for defeating the Demon Lord. Make your apothecary a success! Run the store together with your lovely assistants, and watch it grow! Tips to run a successful apothecary: 1. Collect materials by farming, gathering, fishing, and defeating monsters. 2. Use the collected materials to mix medicines and cook food. 3. Raise your apothecary rank by selling medicines and food in your store. Complete quests to increase your adventurer rank! Listen to the villagers' requests to raise your adventurer rank and get special rewards. Increase intimacy with other characters and get to know them better! Listen to the wishes of the princess and your sister to strengthen your bonds with them! As your relationships deepen, good things may happen... Story In just three years since the invasion of Avalon by Taraxon, the Raging Demon Lord and ruler of the Dark Continent, half of the land had fallen into his evil hands. It seemed that there was nothing the people could do... But God did not abandon mankind. A young girl, Ruti Ragnason, took command of a weakened regional battalion, and led them to victory over the advance troops of the Demon Lord. She then appeared in the royal capital with undeniable evidence that she had been granted the 'Divine Blessing of the Hero.' Gideon Ragnason was banished from Ruti's party because he was 'not strong enough.' Since then, he has retired from the front lines of battle and changed his name to Red. Now, he has opened an apothecary in the frontier land of Zoltan, and hopes to live a slow and happy life there!",
