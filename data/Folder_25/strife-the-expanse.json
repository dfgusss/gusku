    "About the game": "Strife: The Expanse is a Hex-Grid style turn based strategy game. Recruit an assortment of units from across the expanse and do battle with friends or AI on procedurally generated battlegrounds! Inspired by tabletop board games from the past decade, Strife: The Expanse aims to provide a replayable and customizable experience. Features: Utilize seven different Units, each with their own abilities to crush your enemies and lead your team to victory! From defence debuffs to AoE's to passives each unit has its own niche! Map Customization Options such as elevation variance, size, and even the ability to select the map seed! Up to 150x150 and 50+ units are supported at this time. Setup your game for the pacing and play you enjoy! Like a map or want a rematch? Use the same seed and get the same map! Height Matters! Units will take more or less damage depending on their height advantage to other units! Line of sight checks! If your unit can't see an enemy's center of mass then they cant attack them! Use the hills as cover! Free For All &amp; Team Elimination and CTF Gamemodes! Toggleable AI players allowing you to play online Co-op 2v2, setup a offline 1v3 or even just add a fourth to your 3 man free-for-all with your friends! (AI only available for elimination gamemodes.) Adjustable point handicaps: Have a friend who is really bad or really good? Adjust their point handicap to make them sweat! Want to set up a 3v1? Give the lone-wolf some extra points so that your battles are fair and balanced for everyone! Virtual Reality with Oculus Rift: Play with your friends but in VR! Witness the expanse with your own virtual eyes! 50+ Steam Achievements. All of which can be completed against AI! No friends online? No problem! Developer Values Strife: The Expanse is developed by one person. Due to this, the game is able to be offered for the current price as I feel that every purchase a customer makes, should aim to give them the best value for their money. $1/hour has always been a metric I have stood by as a consumer and I have aimed to surpass that as a developer.",
