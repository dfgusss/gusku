    "About the game": "The Chills is a 2D Top-Down Survival Horror game based on the paranormal activities experienced by Jim, who lived in a room in one of the most Haunted hotels in America without knowing that the place has a dark history. In the 19th century, before the hotel was built, there was nothing but a burial ground of Native Americans. But in 2005, the Hotel was built on the same site and many rituals were performed by some Devil worshipers in the basement of the hotel. It had definitely opened a portal to the spirit world which could not be undone. Jim explored the Hotel to find out more evidence of the Paranormal. But when he discovered the presence of many evil entities he was desperately looking for a way to escape the Hotel. Will Jim be able to escape the place unharmed? His life is in your hands now. Key Features: Explore the Haunted Hotel and Experience the Paranormal. Lots of Dark Entities and Demons lurking in the shadows! Nearly Half an hour duration of Paranormal Investigation! Face your fears while you go through creepy Dungeons! Warning: This game contains flashing lights. Note: I am a solo indie game developer and I have done all of the graphics, animation, character design, and programming myself except for the music. I hope you will enjoy the game.",
