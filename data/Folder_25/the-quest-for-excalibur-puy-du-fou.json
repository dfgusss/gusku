    "Release date": "Jul 19, 2022",
    "About the game": "Everyone is familiar with legendary King Arthur and his bitter rival Lancelot. Consumed with envy, the latter challenges the king to a duel. Arthur’s faithful sword Excalibur splinters and breaks until only the cross-guard and handle remain. Arthur enters into a pact with Morgan the Fairy and throws what’s left of his sword in troubled waters. He is then betrayed and ends up a prisoner in the afterlife Kingdom of Avalon. By order of his beloved king, the wizard Merlin sets out on a quest to find Arthur’s heir, gather Excalibur’s 15 fragments and bring Arthur back from the dead. A game map modelled after the world-renowned French theme park. Leave your mark on the Arthurian legends and embark on an adventure of a lifetime to set the king free and find all 15 Excalibur fragments. Travel through time and face a horde of vicious enemies: resist the assault of the dreaded Viking warriors, enter the Roman arena and fight for your life, live the Knight life and win brutal jousting tournaments. Visit a carbon copy of the Puy du Fou domain to find cues and see your mission through, or stroll around the map to complete history-themed secondary quests. Create your own avatar and build a customized Puy du Fou experience as though you were there. Over 15 challenges and a treasure trove of items to discover in a unique whirlwind through Antiquity and the Middle Ages.",
