    "About the game": "THE RIG is a single player, point-and-click style ADVENTURE game for VR, without the point-and-click! Inspired by our favorite adventure games from the 1990s, you explore — in first person — a dilapidated travel agency, an old beater of a starship, and finally encounter The Rig itself -- a hulking asteroid mine at the very edge of deep space. The Rig lets you experience a tight, focused story with a playtime of around the length of a feature film. WOLF 424A, VIRGO SECTOR -- DECEMBER 5th, 2132: You're Willard Pike, failing Mars-based travel agent, now sent to the far reaches of edge-space by your desperate sister-in-law. She's charged you with tracking down Dixon, your estranged, deadbeat brother. Dixon's last known whereabouts are the AMR Alexey Stakhanov — a remote, ominous mining rig hitched to the side of a massive asteroid. But if you do find Dixon, if you stop him from running... what then? Do you bring back the man who ruined his family? THE RIG is a story-driven, immersive ADVENTURE GAME for VR, where you try to unravel the chain of events leading up to the present-day by exploring a small space-freighter and solving conversations and environmental puzzles to find a way to resolve your family's deep-space drama. Story-centric Puzzles Outer space can be unforgiving, and you'll need to find creative solutions to get where you need to be. Sometimes the answer may be obvious and right in front of you, or sometimes you'll need to think a bit outside the box. Sometimes you'll need to turn the gravity off. Just another day in the Twenty-second Century. Rich, old-fashioned detective storytelling over a century in the future! In the tradition of 'The Maltese Falcon' or 'Touch of Evil,' this is a noir-style story like out of the 1940s, but told in the 2100s. You're play as Willard Pike, a Mars-based travel agent thrown back into a family drama he'd hoped he'd left behind for good. Willard's mission? Find his deadbeat brother Dixon, the man Willard hates, before someone even worse does. The story centers around a fully lived-in, explorable starship — hand crafted by an artist — in the style of classic science-fiction vehicles like the Millennium Falcon or the Serenity . Built For VR Designed from the ground-up for a VR experience. Interact with objects and your surroundings in a realistic way, and try not to break anything. Pull levels and panels, command your spaceship, and communicate with a number of friendly or not-so-friendly characters, all without leaving your living room. Play at your own pace. This is a game about exploration, about story and atmosphere. Fully Voice-acted Features a diverse cast of talented and professional voice actors for an immersive experience with branching, narrative dialog. Are you tough-as-nails, no time to argue? Or easy-going and just down on your luck? Optional subtitles can aid in the experience.",
