    "About the game": "Five Ancient Frogs, scattered across the countryside, send a telepathic message to Toki Tori. It’s hard to see how this young chicken could help them destroy the floating crystal endangering everything… but he’s their only hope. Toki Tori 2+ may look cute, but it’s a challenging puzzle adventure game. Whistle and stomp are the only moves you need to solve increasingly complex puzzles, as you go anywhere, anytime on a lush forest island. A unique take on the Metroidvania formula: progress by exploring, observing and experimenting Meet strange critters, study their behaviour and manipulate them with your whistle and stomp moves Find the Ancient Frogs and destroy the crystal at the heart of the island Whistle songs for special abilities, including rewind and fast travel Use the in-game camera and snap creature pictures to complete the Tokidex Push the game’s mechanics to their limits to find 100s of golden wings Steam features Level editor: create and share levels through Steam Workshop 38 Achievements For PC &amp; Mac using SteamPlay",
