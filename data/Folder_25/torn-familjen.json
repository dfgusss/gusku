Fortunately, there's no shortage of fighting skill amongst the group she ends up assembling. ((Please note that while flashing lights have been kept to a minimum, some mild screen flashes were simply impossible to remove. Players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar conditions should exercise caution, and are recommended to keep the game screen at its default small size, just to be safe.))

Five difficulties, ranging from a newcomer-friendly Easy, to Hard for RPG fans, to Insane for ravenous strategic challenge seekers! Minimal necessary grinding. Tough optional bosses.
