Basically, you can proceed with the game only with this movement. In addition, you can perform various operations such as horns, buzzer to contact the conductor, and switching viewpoints. You can also check your driving rating after driving. ■ About Tatehama Electric Railway The Tatehama Electric Railway main line connects Otebashi Station to Tatehama Station. At present, the line can operate up and down 9.6 km of this line from Hamazono Station to Tatehama Station. The train departs from Hamazono Station, and after passing Tsusaki Station, it goes through a tunnel and runs along the sea until it reaches Kaigan Koen Station. After passing Komano Station, the train goes underground and reaches the terminus at Tatehama. ■ About live distribution etc. This game is OK for live video and distribution. It's okay to monetize your videos and distribution.",
