With no phone service, no internet, and no entertainment, Nick decides to explore the surrounding backwoods... But things take an even darker turn when he stumbles upon a gruesome scene. Accompanied by two new local acquaintances; Felix, the cabin owner’s straight-laced son, and Grayson, the caretaker’s happy-go-lucky daughter, Nick’s first goal is to uncover the mystery of what haunts the woods. His second is to survive it. Unearth secrets hidden between the trees. Solve a murder. Confront what awaits in the darkness. Whatever transpires, you’re guaranteed to be up all night.
