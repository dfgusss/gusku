    "About the game": "When you buy a country farm you should be ready for anything, even an alien invasion. A house far from civilization is all our hero has ever dreamed of, and it just so happens that a juicy offer has presented itself. And it's no accident: it turns out that he isn't the only one eyeing the land. An unsuccessful experiment has resulted in aliens breaching their enclosure and breaking free. You'll have to fight to protect your house, as you have no other choice. Survive five days without letting your farm get overrun and learn the secret of their arrival, but be prepared! Nobody knows what they're capable of.",
