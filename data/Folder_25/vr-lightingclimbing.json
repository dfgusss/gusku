    "About the game": "This is a simple and relaxing VR game. This game is inspired by extreme sports rock climbing. A game of fast climbing to the top and reaching the top goal in the fastest time. This game only requires basic VR operations. It doesn't bring dizziness in VR. This game is helpful for the exercise of the cervical spine. Due to the need to watch the game levels upward for a long time, all the cervical spine exercises are mixed. It is also a sports game that helps in physical exercise. The number of levels in the first version of the game is not very large. We will continue to update more and more interesting levels for free in subsequent versions. The game will record the player's clearance time, and you can see the fastest clearance time of others in the game. Send your favorite levels to the comment area and we will make more levels of the same type. Later levels will be added for free through updated versions. We are developing a multiplayer network mode in the middle and late stages of production and we will add it to the game.",
