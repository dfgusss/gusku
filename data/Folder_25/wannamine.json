    "About the game": "WannaMine - not so long ago we were plagued with the virus 'Virus Petya' and 'WannaCry', but there is a new virus called 'WannaMine'. This virus loads the CPU(Central processor) and produces cryptocurrency to the attacker. In this game you have to control the virus so he could get around the firewall of computer 'firewall' and get directly to the CPU! A winding path makes the game fun and not easy. Features: - Based on real events - Original soundtrack - The game difficulty increases in ascending order - 18 different levels to pass",
