    "About the game": "Advance in Society and bargain with creatures in the Wood in a Regency fantasy of manners, daring, and magic. Will you join your daemon overlords in destroying your hometown or will you defy them? Weyrwood is a 174,000 word interactive fantasy novel by Isabella Shaw, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. You are a fledgling member of the shabby-genteel, you've returned from your education to disentangle your inheritance from your small town's oblique magical property laws. Attend assemblies, call upon friends and neighbors, withstand scandal and intrigue, and court prospective suitors as if your life depended on it—for it does. Maintaining your status as a member of the Gentry and living among the Willed depends upon keeping your spina, a magical currency. Otherwise, you will serve as a tithe to the daemons and join the Fallen, their Will-less thralls. Yet you cannot remain only concerned with your own affairs. Someone is tampering with the magical contract that binds Prosper, the Wood, and the daemons to the tenuous arrangement that you now enjoy. Can you survive long enough to claim your inheritance and return to the City—or to remain in Prosper and enjoy the abundant blessings that wealth, freedom, and influence can grant you? Play as female, male, or non-binary; gay, straight, bi, or asexual. Uncover the daemon plot and protect your town, or side with the daemons to destroy it. Win a high-stakes game of cards. Ally with the daemons or with the weyrs. Gain wyrdsense to perform sorcery. Fight a courtly duel. Court an eligible marriage prospect and take a lover. Gain influence at balls, assemblies, and social events. Avoid—or embrace—scandal. Bargain with the magical weyrs of the forest to preserve your Will. Advance to become a Pillar of Society. What Would You Sacrifice to Keep From Falling?",
