Sounds simple but it’s not. With some of the simpler puzzles offering over 43 quintillion possible configurations (that’s 43,000,000,000,000,000,000), finding the single correct one will be a challenge! Shuffle the cube again once you're done and try a new combination you need to crack! Take your time and relax, or put yourself up against the clock to see how fast you can be! A staggering 20 different puzzles for you to play with. With puzzle shapes ranging from classic cubes to pyramids, dodecahedrons, and even off-axis shapes; there is something exciting for uninitiated and expert puzzlers alike!",
