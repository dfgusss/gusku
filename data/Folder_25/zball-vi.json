When interacting with such an object, the green ball begins to react accordingly. In addition, the game has moving platforms that will complicate the task. Use portals, gravity changers and all other mechanics from previous Zball games! There are game levels of different difficulty and types. Some levels require dexterity and reaction, some will require patience and caution, others will make you think about the sequence of actions. You can see how to interact with an object by its color. For example, green is the main color, and you need to deliver it to the platform of the corresponding color. Yellow object reacts to explosions from mouse clicks. Blue objects are destroyed when they collide with yellow ones. Blue ones are not destructible, but they can be moved by yellow objects. Red objects break down from the explosion… Gradually you will understand how the system works and will be able to cope with any task! Exciting gameplay will not let you get bored!
