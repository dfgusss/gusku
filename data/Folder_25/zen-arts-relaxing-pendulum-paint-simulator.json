My ultimate goal is to make mental health therapies more interesting and more accessible by transforming them into games/apps. However that process will take a lot of research, time and resources, so for now I am happy with making simple apps that help people de-stress, relax, and perhaps gain some skills while they are it. My main interest is in treating anxiety disorders and insomnia! Your support truly helps me making my goal come true! :) ------------------------------------------------------- About This Game: Using the concepts of mindfulness and arts therapy in aiding relaxation and releasing mental stress; and inspired by a patient of mine, who finds art helpful in managing her anxiety disorder, however struggles to get started due to lack of confidence in her skill. Hopefully with Zen Arts, anyone, regardless of age or skills, can make great arts! The only limitation is your imagination! There is no winning or losing in this game, simply a sandbox to hopefully make your day a bit better!",
