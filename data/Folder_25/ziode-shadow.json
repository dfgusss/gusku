    "About the game": "WARNING! - This game requires you to think for yourself. Ziode Shadow combines classic 2D platforming with original puzzle concepts and super sharp visuals. It follows Higgs, a hungover planet explorer, and his unwanted bot companion. The gameplay centres around a support pod that is sent to the planet's surface to help you on your mission. The pod has very limited movement, so it's up to you to manipulate your surroundings, enabling both you, and the pod to navigate the terrain. To do this you must use a 'Gravity Gun' type device to utilize many different objects, each with their own properties. One will explode, enabling you to destroy large rocks, kill enemies, or propel the pod into the air. Another one will freeze things, making their movement slower. Sometimes the pod is a hindrance, other times it's a necessity. At some points you will be split up and forced to take separate routes. But at all times you must work together to get to the end of the mission. Keep track of your stats and try to beat your high scores. Try to complete the game with the least amount of jumps or objects used, in the fastest time, without dying. Each requires a different strategy and multiple playthroughs. Controlling the Move Device is crucial to success. So the Practice Mode is designed to hone your targeting skills, whether throwing on full power to explode fruit, or a lighter throw for careful placement on a far away platform. Features Fully voiced dialogue. Hidden Objects. Practice Mode. Stats and best scores. Unique camera system, looking at the 2D plane from a 3D perspective. High resolution, hand drawn graphics, enhanced by super-sampling. HDR (on supported TVs). Customizable controls. Original soundtrack. Achievements. Designed for a controller. Also works great with keyboard and mouse. Join the discord server to give feedback, get support and upload your speed runs.",
