    "About the game": "You're a distant blip amongst the sands around New Port City; It's been a long few shifts, but you're almost done with doing your sweep of the guidance stations for the docking spaceships. Take your Massive Self-Sustaining Installation Repair Truck (or MSSIRT for short); &amp; travel the landscape to fix the last few on your list for the day with your trusty multi-tool crane. A Day of Maintenance is a new, unusual kind of exploration game, taking cues from In Other Waters, 17776, Signal from Tolva, and Euro Truck Simulator 2 If you've ever found yourself thinking: 'I want a kind-of-technical driving game with a little gay romance but also some discussion over robot worker consciousness. (With crane operation gameplay)' This game is for you. Around 8 hours long This game is deliberately slow-paced . Enjoy the drive, sip a cup of something warm, fix sites in the distant future. Chat with your Robot Boyfriend, 6 workmates, &amp; a couple other characters along the way. Best played with a gamepad. But there's mouse &amp; keyboard bindings for everything. Chat with Orby about cool stuff like databases, satellite software, and the possibility of having your mind overwritten by a routine check-up. As you drive the open desert, your crew of fellow maintenance robots will chew the scenery; debating over trains, spaceships, philosophy, and hats. Oh! You might also uncover a conspiracy.",
