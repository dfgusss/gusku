    "About the game": "All The Delicate Duplicates is a short single player first-person narrative game that toys with the concept of time: reality isn’t stable or linear here, but unfurls across a storyworld that bends, flexes and (in some instances) duplicates. Story John, a computer engineer and single father, inherits a collection of arcane objects from Mo, his mysterious relative. Over time, John and his daughter Charlotte begin to realise that these objects have unusual physical properties – and that the more they are exposed to them, the more their reality and memories appear to change. Features Haunting freeform environments with open exploration. Non-linear narrative that pieces together through interactive discoveries in the gameworld and a text based backstory. Commissioned by The Space. Supported by Tumblr through their International Digital Media and Arts Prize. David-Lynch-like intrigue (if we do say so ourselves) via a variable storyline. Expectations Prepare to have your storytelling perceptions stretched beyond the “real” as you (think you) know it. Warnings All The Delicate Duplicates contains minimal strobe-like effects, minimal to moderate profanity, potentially creepy psychological concepts and themes, and not an ounce of gore.",
