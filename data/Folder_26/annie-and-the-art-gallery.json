    "About the game": "Annie and the Art Gallery is a short, free horror RPG that aims to capture the feel from classic RPGMaker horror games. You play as Annie, a girl who's finally got a ticket to the new art exhibit. When she gets there, however, she's dragged into a bizarre conflict that takes her through the museum's haunted basement. Help Annie solve puzzles, figure out who to trust, and find out the truth of what happened there years before. Some random and possibly cool features: Unique hand-drawn art style. Save at any time. Ghost girl(s). Animated cutscenes. Traps, sudden deaths, and chase sequences. Multiple difficulty options. A non-silent protagonist in an RPGMaker horror game. Maybe a plot twist. Note from the developer: Thank you for playing my game! I am a solo developer based in the New England region, and it really means a lot that you've read this far! Annie and the Art Gallery is a love letter to classic RPGMaker horror hits such as Witch’s House and Ib. Inspiration was also drawn from more contemporary RPGMaker hits such as Oneshot and Omori.",
