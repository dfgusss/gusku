    "About the game": "Block motion is a puzzle / design game where you place functional blocks to design a working factory that assembles the desired output. Build your design, press play and watch your factory in action. You have the freedom to solve the challenges any way you want; The only limit is your imagination. Design! Assemble your solutions and watch them run in real time. Between the campaign of 29 challenges and the workshop tools to easily download player made challenges you will find no end to the amount of time you can spend coming up with new designs for solutions. Improve! Use the histograms to see how well your solutions perform compared to those made by other players. Refine your solutions to improve your scores and earn achievements. Set your own goals! You can connect up blocks of different types to create an almost limitless number of solutions. There is no single correct way to solve to a challenge, just different designs. If you're not feeling competitive you can turn off the histograms, set your own goals and just play the game the way you want to. Customize! The level editor is built right into the game itself. Create your own challenges using the same tools that I used to create the campaign. Publish your level to the Steam Workshop and see the scores achieved by other players on the histograms as they build their solutions to your challenge.",
