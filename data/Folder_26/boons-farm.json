Fight endless waves of the locals, who ate the wrong apple and while you're at that compete to achieve the highest score Meet the locals. Leon, the local police officer age 34 while at the family sit down ate the Boony markets corn on the cob and devoured his family Jessica, local nurse sniffed the wrong war-mart apple and contracted a nippy cough. Let's not forget skinless Freddy.. Freddy is not hairless and deformed because of the cough, Leon the local officer while making hot dogs got lighter fluid on Freddy. Features Economy, score, waves and lots of zombies! Compete to see who killed Leon, Freddy, and Jessica more! Running out of ammo, or is the gun not shooting as fast as you'd like? Simple, buy the newest upgrade hidden within the map. Endless waves of locals, as the wave gets higher so does the amount of locals! Content updates The game is not early access, the pure concept of the game is for arcade and that's what it is right now. However, that's not to say new content won't come for the game or that there aren't bugs. Please note, all new content will be FREE and there is no planned DLC.",
