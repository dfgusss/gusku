    "About the game": "The recipes for success are varied; find delicious fruits and vegetables, and combine them with freshly chopped and cooked tourists for a truly divine delicacy fit for the God Hoochooboo. Of course the tourists might not offer themselves up freely, the heathens, so you’ll need to master your arcade reflexes and special powers (like fire breathing for baking) to persuade them without getting KO’d! Tour the island Ready, steady, cook your way through many levels in a full campaign across the island. Overcome spikes in mysterious temples, bushwhack your way through tourist infested jungles and stay away from lava in the underground. Other-foodly activities All kinds of extra-culinary skills are needed too to appease Hoochooboo. Skills such as outrunning the Spikey Log of Doom™, defeating waves of tourists and the tour boss in the jungle arena, as well as other challenge levels to prove yourself as the one true cook. Choose your cooking style Special powers are the perfect ingredients for success, allowing you to dash, place healing totems or even breathe fire. In multiplayer each chef can choose a different ability to fit their cooking style. Foodfest or Foodfight Cook your way through hell’s kitchen solo or with up to 4 chefs. Or challenge each other to foodfights in PvP. With so many chefs in the kitchen, chaos is sure to follow. Cannibal Cuisine features: Arcade combat with unfortunate tourists - don't forget your special powers! Navigate varied tropical levels to collect extra ingredients and prepare Hoochooboo’s meals. Many levels of cannibal chaos in the jungle, temple, on the beach, and inside a volcano! Choose your cannibal couture with many options for weapons and accessories. Play solo, cooperatively, or in versus mode with 1-4 players. A new threat: The Scarab King The Scarab King has cursed the land and spawned Hoochooboo all over the desert. Defeat The Scarab King to lift the curse! 'The Curse of the Scarab King' is a free content update that adds 5 regular cooking levels and a challenge level within a new environment. It also introduces new mechanics, extra deadly traps and cosmetics in the new desert theme.",
