    "About the game": "From the creators of the award-winning Arma™ tactical military shooter series comes a next-gen re-imagination of a groundbreaking 80s classic. Set in a vast open archipelago, Carrier Command: Gaea Mission brings a breathtaking combination of action game and strategy elements! As a result of a catastrophic war between the United Earth Coalition and the Asian Pacific Alliance, Earth has been rendered an almost uninhabitable wasteland. The only hope lies in a distant planetary system, where the moon Taurus holds the key to restoring Earth's dwindling water supply. As a battle-hardened member of the surviving UEC forces, Lt Myrik is put in command of an armed vehicle carrier. By traversing the seas and establishing a network of island bases, his mission is to hunt down the enemy and conquer the Dead Zone on the planetoid Taurus. Key Features Story-Driven Campaign Follow the immersive storyline as you evolve from underdog rookie to Carrier Commander in a battle against overwhelming odds. Strategy Campaign Experience the original 80s classic; select startup settings, the balance of power and challenge the enemy carrier to an ultimate strategic duel. Explore 30+ unique islands in 6 distinct climatic zones. Island Network Roam the seas to establish a network of island bases for defense, mining and manufacturing. A steady supply of resources is vital to your campaign’s success. Unit Customization Build new upgrades and weapons for your Carrier and combat units, but keep an eye on fuel and ammo. Join the Action Get into the heart of the action by taking direct control of any unit. Shift seamlessly from combat vehicles to strategic map via the unique Picture-in-Picture window.",
