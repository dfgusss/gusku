    "About the game": "Baby Pandas grow up fast! Chill Panda is excited to go out into the world but feels worried about exploring alone! Chill Panda heads to the beautiful island of Chill Ville near the sea where it’s said that a very calm and wise panda lives. Discover the secrets of the island. Help Chill Panda manage fear and worry. So that nothing can stop Panda from having fun! Features: ■ Fill Chill Panda’s Well of Wellbeing by drinking water and chewing bamboo ■ Meet the villagers and help them out by farming and clearing the land ■ Use your senses to catch fireflies ■ Create colourful pictures and to decorate Chill Panda’s home ■ Earn coins by completing tasks to buy furniture and equipment for Panda’s home and garden ■ Release energy at the beach by surfing the waves or banging on the drums ■ Personalise Panda with new wardrobe options and backpack customisation ■ Collect seeds and grow your own flower garden So, here's the important bit... Chill Panda isn't a medical device but the techniques we use in the game draw on a broad spectrum of scientific studies and evidence. There are plenty of games on the market that address the issue of anxiety in adults but very few designed to help children under eight recognise and manage feelings of anxiety. We've spent the last two years in a global pandemic, which is scary for children. However, we knew, before Covid 19, that children were experiencing more anxiety at a younger age. There's a lot of well publicised research exploring why children are more anxious and areas of children's mental health to be aware of. Mental health charity Place2Be says two thirds of 10/11 year olds worry all the time. It's shocking but there’s plenty for them to worry about in the modern world. By working closely with Dr Caroline Belcher, CGA has identified four pillars of relaxation. These pillars help refocus anxious children and are incorporated into activities in our game - giving children skills for life.",
