You must use what you get. Endless airstrikes or an army of rats? There are many paths to Rome, but you decide. Search cities and conquer buildings The cities are created procedurally, allowing for endless combinations. Plunder the cities as quickly as possible, otherwise an exploding zombie might blast you to pieces, or a zombie on steroids might stomp you to dust. Be careful! Very dangerous hordes of zombies await in the night. What happened? Shortly before the aplocalypse begins, the fast-food chain MKing brings out a new burger. The meat includes a secret, addictive ingredient to increase profits. The plan works. Over time, however, the drug, leads to the shutting down of all areas of the brain except for the need for fresh meat. Lots of meat! If that's not bad enough, the disease also prevents consumers from dying a natural death – violent means are the only option New with the 1.5 - Fly me to the moon update: Expand your base by building various rooms like a greenhouse or a mechanic room and craft crazy, unique weapons!",
