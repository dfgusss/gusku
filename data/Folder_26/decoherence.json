    "About the game": "Build robots from a wide variety of components. Plan a strategy to carry you to victory. Fight as a pilot alongside your bots in exciting PvP matches or test your mettle in the single player Entropy Tribunals! Customize your bots and assign them specific commands to carry out your strategy! Pilot your creations personally and adapt to the chaos of the matches! Manage unpredictability! No two arenas are ever the same, so plan carefully but remain adaptable as anything can happen during a match. More of a lone wolf? Jump into the Entropy Tribunals and have a go at the single player mode, in which you’re continually tested but thoroughly rewarded for your performance!",
