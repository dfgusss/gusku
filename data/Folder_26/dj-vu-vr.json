    "About the game": "This Game is a storygame in VR. You are placed in a city named 'Evia'. Everything you see is out of a 'giant perspective'. You can explore the city by walking or using the controller and pull yourself through. You are also able to slide the map up and down and adjust the volume. In the city itself there is lot for you to discover. Besides there are 12 hidden Scenes (+1) and one that can be explored and will tell you one explicit story. Attached above the controller there is a 'Timeline' that shows you what scene in the chronological line you have already found. As soon as you are in front of one particular scene the controller should 'vibrate' and fill out the timeline. When you have found all 12 Scenes a new one will reveal. Find it again and the story of Evia is solved! Or has it just began?",
