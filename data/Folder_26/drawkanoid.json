    "About the game": "Drawkanoid is a neon-drenched love letter to brick breaking games. We took out all the boring bits, like paddles, and turned everything up to 11! The ball moves at hyperspeed, shattering everything into explosion-filled eyecandy. Bullet time lets you react at the speed of thought. Tactically deployable powerups let you decide exactly when to go into full ludicrous mode. Unlock Countdown and Zen modes to up the tension or zone out and smash therapeutically beautiful glowing patterns. You've never played something quite like this.",
