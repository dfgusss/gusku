    "About the game": "Dungeon Delver is a 2D, turn-based, side-scrolling battle RPG with roguelike elements. Features Mage Character Play as a magical being with 4 abilities. Zap an enemy with a powerful bolt, throw a fireball and watch them burn, cause an eruption at their feet to hit more than one foe, or throw up a magical barrier to protect yourself from their attacks. Endless Mode In endless mode, battling your way through waves of enemies will earn you gold that you can spend on permanent upgrades to your character. Additionally, during your delves you will sometimes come across Runestones that will grant you a choice between a set of powerful augmentations to your abilities for the remainder of that delve. Survival Mode In survival mode you get to preemptively choose any combination of 10 powerful effects to augment your abilities on your delve. Pick wisely though, as you won't find any additional powers during your delve. Having a good plan of action will get you far here.",
