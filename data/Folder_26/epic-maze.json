    "About the game": "overview 'epic maze' is a third-person shooter game in which you must find your way to the gramophone in a procedurally generated 3d maze by following its music (stereo speakers/headphones), turn it off, and then return. Trick is to remember your path, do not get lost in witches’ mansion. Cinematic, realistic graphics from Quixel's megascans. Enjoy Nicolas Gasparini's (Myuu) dark piano music while playing the game. For a best experience, use stereo speakers or headphones. Original new concept. One of a kind. Replayable custom game. procedurally generated in real-time (different maze every gameplay) 3d maze is generated procedurally in real-time making it unique every single time, and its size can be adjusted to suit your gaming style, ranging from small (4x4x1) to very large (15x15X15). maze size : 5x5x5 vs maze size : 15x15x15 vs Spider Spider movement is dynamic (leg movement of spiders is calculated in real-time for natural results), which means spiders are CPU intensive.
