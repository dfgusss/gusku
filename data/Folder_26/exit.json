    "About the game": "EXIT is a puzzle game that requires pure logic rather than luck or dexterity. It now includes 100 levels (60 campaign + 10 extra in survival + 20 in SEASON1 update + 10 EXTRA levels) that will blow your mind. The goal is seemingly simple: put all the balls into their corresponding target slots. While this sounds easy the game isn't so much. One has to invest time into the game master it. Three difficulty levels: • Casual - no time pressure, relaxed bonus requirements • Normal - challenging amount of time for each level • Pro - very sharp times and bonus requirements Features: • Atmospheric 3D environments • Polished visuals • Solid game play • Make your own way though the game : multiple solutions exist for each puzzle • Clear goals, simple game mechanics • Campaign and Survival modes • Achievements • Trading Cards • Offers best in class puzzle experience • Catchy music tracks • Multilingual EXIT offers 50+ hours of gameplay for those who'd like to earn 100% achievements. Although EXIT is a puzzle game, it is highly re-playable due to its difficulty and unique design.",
