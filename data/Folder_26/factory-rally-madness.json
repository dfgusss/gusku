    "About the game": "You are a robot and there is a factory... a dangerous one, and there are other robots... and everyone is running to be the first... and your program... it is messy and crazy, let´s try again... As one of the robots in a factory full of dangers and excitement, compete with everyone to be the best running robot. To make things more interesting, all robots must program their movements while running based on program line instructions cards available at random on their own programming stack. Can you win all the races? Don´t forget to choose your robot model to stand out in the crowd, and also to know which robot is yours. Program, race, win... or be destroyed! CHOOSE YOUR ROBOT! Choose from twenty different robot models. Complete tasks in the game to unlock the deactivated robots and have all of them at your disposal in this insane factory race. A single player experience but with all the excitement and feel of a multiplayer game! SELECT THE CHALLENGE! Put your robot to compete in a quick race against other robots or test your skills in a multi-track tournament in different areas of the factory: Foundry, Fabrication and Assembly. Several obstacles are between your robot and the objective points that form the race´s track. All tracks, their obstacles and objectives are procedurally generated. No track is ever the same! RUN! Run through the factory in two game modes. In programmed game mode your robot has an instruction compiler and executes the movements in sequence. Plan your movements using the available instructions, creating a movement programming sequence. Real time mode allows you to choose the instruction you want your robot to execute right away, but stay tuned as instructions have a cooldown time before they can be used again. Both modes can be played at normal, fast and super-fast speeds. GOAL AND SECRETS! Use the items distributed in the track to assist you during races. Consult your statistics containing information about your performance. Discover the secrets contained in the game. Can you figure them all out? WHERE IS MY MULTIPLAYER? This game was designed to be a single player experience, like the old fun racing games, with some puzzle twists on it. If the game performers well in sales, we will see a multiplayer version of it with tournaments, custom skins and unique rewards for the best players.",
