    "About the game": "We got the call, a building is burning and there are people trapped inside. Fire is spreading and time is running out. We've had reports of explosions and the whole thing can come crashing down at any moment. You know the job: get those survivors out of there. Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a turned-based strategy game that places you in command of a squad of specially trained firefighters with the sole aim to rescue survivors form a raging structural fire. Your team will need to make the most of each turn using limited action points and specialized abilities to explore the environment, tame the volatile fire and rescue the survivors before the building is reduced to rubble. As the official digital adaptation of the acclaimed board game from Indie Boards and Cards you will experience the same excitement and challenge of the original in a light-hearted digital form. Key Features Pick-up-and-Play Turn-Based Tactics Quick to learn with a simplified Family Rules mode, coordinate your team as they identify and rescue survivors, get distracted by false alarms, and hold back the flames as they do their best to avoid explosions. Deep Tactics Experienced Rules mode lets each member of your squad bring a unique set of skills that they will need to carefully apply as they adapt to the ever changing scenarios. Destroy walls and dash through buildings with the Rescue Specialist, revive unconscious survivors with the Paramedic, command your team members out of dangerous situations with the Fire Captain, and many more.",
