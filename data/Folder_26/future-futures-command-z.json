    "About the game": "Command Z is an exhibition realized by Michael Ziga; an experience viewed from the perspective of our successors, reflecting back on humanity from a distant future, as we now observe our predecessors. These works imagine the development of our devices and their effects on the evolution of humanity. Virtual sculptures in the galleries, produced using 3D scanning and digital sculpting techniques, are backed by images generated during the scanning process. 3D soundscapes - composed by Palmer Foote, Jimmy Quinn, Connor Hanwick, Olivia Harris, and Peter Toh - complement the installations, propelling the viewer through the virtual spaces. * Teleport into the black door to advance between levels !!! *",
