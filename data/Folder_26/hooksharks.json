    "About the game": "Love, passion. Hooks, Sharks. Hooksharks is an open-source local multiplayer game about glory, and most of all, battling sharks. Enter the arena and venture through the two exciting game modes: “Racing” and “Deathmatch”. Gotta go fast! In “Racing” mode you and your friends will fight for glory inside the game's exciting and hazard-filled tracks. You'll find several items and power-ups to your shark that will help you hook your way to the first place. It's the thrill of the fight! The 'Deathmatch' maps are destined for the most skilled and brave gladiators of the arena: no tricks, no training wheels: just you, your shark and a blazing trail of flammable oil, until there's only one left!",
