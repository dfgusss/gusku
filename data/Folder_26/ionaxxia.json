    "About the game": "Flippin’ ‘eck! Pesky aliens have nabbed the world’s argon! Join the ionAXXIA and go get it back!! Enjoy something new with the Big Brained shooter genre! Diverging from the current fashion of ‘bullet storm’ and twin-stick shooters, ionAXXIA challenges the mind as well as hand/eye coordination through a string of 1v1 fights with rock-paper-scissors like ship matching. Match your strengths to your enemy’s weaknesses, and when that fails and you’re completely outclassed, find some other sneaky, underhanded way to take them down. Patience, timing, and smart decision are essential, from choosing your ship, to when and where to engage – flying headlong, guns blazing, is a sure way to a quick (and unsuccessful!) end. Design your own ships Design your own combat vessels from a wide array of 6 component types – design, hull, engine, generator, primary weapon, and secondary. 81 different components at launch provide millions of variations, and the gadgetry aims to be the most varied and interesting possible. We got blasters, lasers, boosters, antimatter spread, mining lasers, scatterpack missiles, and grapplers. We got autosentries. Ion Stream Projectors. We got knives. Sharp sticks. Plus, unlimited upgrades! Beef up your gear to insane levels with no limit on how many upgrades you can apply. A passion project from a gamer sick of playing buggy games ionAXXIA is a five year labour of love, to create a next-gen Star Control like game. Unlike many modern games that launch broken and fix bugs after time (if we’re lucky), I believe the gamer deserves a proper, working product at launch. Every bug is squished as a priority, and Early Access has allowed me to find and squelch enough that no-one’s coming across them in play. Those found with the release candidate version have been patched within 24 hours of finding them. Classic '90s space-game flavouring Inspired by the great 1990s space games such as Master of Orion, Ascendancy, and of course Star Control, ionAXXIA indulges in the same delight of varied tech and gobbledegook sci-fi jargon. Cross progression with mobile ionAXXIA was designed from day one to play as well on mobile as on PC, incorporating multiple control options for touch screen and full controller support. Cloud saves allow you to take your galactic progress on the bus or into tiresome meetings at work, and then back to the big screen.",
