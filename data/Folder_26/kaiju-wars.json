    "About the game": "Kaiju are approaching the city! Scramble the jets and deploy the tanks in this 2D turn-based strategy game. Command the army We need more time! - Play as the mayor of Floatio city, tasked with holding off the overwhelming strength of a kaiju attack. Park tanks and jets in the monster's path to slow it down (don't worry, we have a good insurance policy). Construct buildings! - Build sacrificial army bases and airfields to distract the kaiju and line the city streets with fodder. Deploy experimental weapons! - Conventional weapons aren't enough; deploy experimental weapons such as freeze rays and transforming mechas to keep the kaiju at bay. Evacuate! - Our chief scientist is working on an anti-monster serum, but it's not ready yet! Be prepared to evacuate the laboratory using transport trucks, boats, or planes when the kaiju get too close. Fight the KAIJU! Five unique kaiju - Each specializing in different types of destruction. They mutate! - Tremble in fear as each kaiju grows stronger and gains devastating abilities through mid-level mutations. Unstoppable! - Kaiju can't be killed, but can only be slowed down and forced to fall back... for now. Pepper them with ammunition, if you can.. Predictable! - They move towards the nearest building, and those scientists have mathed the exact odds as to where they might go next. Use this info wisely! Campaign Mode!
