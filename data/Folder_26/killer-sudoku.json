    "About the game": "Presented by Cracking The Cryptic, YouTube’s most popular Sudoku channel, comes a new game based on our most requested variant: Killer Sudoku. In Killer Sudoku, every puzzle features cages that tell you the sum of the numbers inside. This extra information leads to beautiful logic that you will master as you progress through our handmade puzzles. The puzzles in Killer Sudoku are created by Simon and Mark as well as a large number of guest creators. Fans of Cracking the Cryptic's YouTube channel will recognize many of these authors as some of the most talented creators working today! As with our other games (‘Classic Sudoku’, ‘Sandwich Sudoku’, ‘Chess Sudoku’, 'Thermo Sudoku' and 'Miracle Sudoku'), Simon Anthony and Mark Goodliffe (the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic) have written all the hints for the puzzles. So you know that every puzzle has been play-tested by a human being to ensure that each sudoku is interesting and fun to solve. In Cracking The Cryptic’s games, players start with zero stars and earn stars by solving puzzles. The more puzzles you solve, the more stars you earn and the more puzzles you get to play. Only the most dedicated (and cleverest) sudoku players will finish all the puzzles. Of course the difficulty is carefully calibrated to ensure lots of puzzles at every level (from easy through to extreme). Anyone familiar with their YouTube channel will know that Simon and Mark take pride in teaching viewers to be better solvers and, in these games, they always craft the puzzles with the mindset of trying to help solvers improve their skills. Mark and Simon have both represented the UK many times at the World Sudoku Championship and you can find more of their puzzles (and lots of others) on the internet’s biggest sudoku channel Cracking The Cryptic. Features: 40 beautiful puzzles on launch 100 puzzles in all with regular updates to reach this total in the first year post launch. Hints crafted by Simon and Mark!",
