    "About the game": "Hi! Yo, you there! Are you tired beeing human? Do you want to try be something else? How about to be a frog for a while? Yes? Then this game can be for you! This game has been developed by one man army - Bl0ckDave Studio , this is my very first published game ever, and it all started as new years eve 2021-2022 stream challenge. Challenge was about that I suppose to finish easy achievement game untill new year come. To be honest I didnt make it so my friend could pick up the name, so here comes 'Krek Da Frog' ! Whats the game about? Whole game is about eating butterflies. Player controls frog which can move and jump around environment. Player must eat nearby butterflies to reach next level, if player eats enough butterflies magic doors are opened and player can continue. Water in environments is toxic to Krek and his friends, if player falls to it, he looses one of his three lives. If player has 0 lives and dies game is over and player must start again. In game are no time limits, game suppose to be funny and relaxing. So, what can you expect by buing this game? Game is very simple, from begining you will have 2 frogs available, after pressing Play button you will get to the 'season map overview', where you can choose level to go. In leveles player have to eat enough butterflies to get to next level. Water is toxic (!!!) so watch your steps! On most levels you have get over obstacles. Main goal is to get to the finish to open next (season if season is available). At this moment is only one season opened. Also by eating butterlies you will get achievements, by unlocking achievements you will get more frogs, more frogs, more fun! By purchasing this game you will support the creation of Bl0ckDave Studio!",
