    "About the game": "An honest letter from developers. Dear players. As a newly formed Indie game company, this was our first game. So we feel obligated to be 100% honest with you. Here, you can read what was our roadmap and what you can expect from this game. Our roadmap was simple and clear. When we first started developing Mage Rage, Action RPG was really popular so we wanted to be a part of it. We designed a Hack &amp; Slash game mode and our goal was adding a lore, story mode and co-op option. While working on Mage Rage, we applied for many funding but could not get any. We tried to cover all the expenses on our own. After a while, we were not able to keep doing that. Also, worldwide Covid 19 restrictions did not help so we had to quit developing after a year full of joy and happiness. Like mentioned before, we were working on a lore, story mode and co-op mechanics. We were also working on more playable characters, new maps, passive skills, global leaderboard and map events but we had to scrap all of them out. So what can you expect from Mage Rage? If you like single player games and challenging yourself or if you are looking for a game to clear your head and play it for a couple of hours this may be a game for you. About bugs. Since we could not build a big community, we could not get as much feedback as we expected. We fixed every single bug we encountered and reported from players. We can assure you that there is not a single game breaking bug in the game. You can read more about Mage Rage down below, thank you for reading. ----- Players will control a mighty fire magician and fight against unholy enemies and their allies.
