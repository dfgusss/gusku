    "About the game": "MindMap VR expands your mind with mind mapping that is impossible in reality. You can input your ideas from your voice, and they will be floated one after another in the air, lined up in a 360-degree space, up, down, left, and right, revealing even your unconscious thoughts that you were not aware of. Output to 360-degree space The greatest merit of VR is that it can represent a space that is not possible in reality. Now that we are beginning to use that space for mind mapping, we can't predict what will happen to us. Input by voice The words you speak will materialize and appear in front of you. With MindmapVR, this process, which used to be done with a pen on paper or a keyboard on a PC, is now done by voice. Simple MindmapVR includes only the minimum functions required for mind mapping. Supplemental Please make sure to try the trial version before purchasing. Microphones and controllers may not work or may be difficult to use depending on the device and environment The Index Controller will not work, but the index itself will work, so please use it with a Vive controller or similar. Input is currently only available by voice. The saved data is stored in CSV format. The saved data is saved as a CSV file. You can edit the file after saving the characters you did not understand well.",
