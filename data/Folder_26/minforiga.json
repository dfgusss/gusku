    "About the game": "Minesweeper with a character! The earth's core crystal has cracked, sending pockets of unstable energy across the land. You must dig down to the center of the earth, avoiding pockets of unstable energy along the way, and mend the core crystal before it's too late. The core gameplay is the same as Minesweeper, but you are limited by the tiles which your character can actually reach as you dig. Use gems with different abilities to help you along your way. Compete against yourself to push your high score higher, or relax and dig in casual mode.",
