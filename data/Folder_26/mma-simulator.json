    "About the game": "MMA Simulator is one of the most detailed text-based simulations where you have the unique perspective of owning your own MMA gym and taking the fight world by storm! Features: Create your own fighters Create the fighters YOU want to see fight! Whether that a striker, grappler, or submission artist - you can create them and add your own custom portraits. Create and edit events Take on the role of matchmaker and create the events you want to see! Train three characteristics, five martial art disciplines and 26 sub-skills for complete customization. Every skill matters in MMA Simulator. Having a fighter that specializes in a few strikes can be more dangerous than a jack of all trades! Robust Combat System Text based, detailed combat is what MMA Simulator excels in. Fights can go anywhere a real fight does - Standing, Clinch, and Ground. Positioning matters and submissions go through several stages depending on their complexity. The dynamic is completely different between two fighters! Manage your fighter AND coach roster Train your fighters and recruit new ones with promise to rise to to the top of the MMA world! But where could you get without coaches? Hiring coaches will allow you to train your fighters faster. Take your gym to the next level Managing a gym means everything from picking the best location to expanding in size to accommodate more fighters, and manage buying equipment to help your fighters train. Manage your fighters well-being The fight game is rough. Ensuring your fighters stay healthy and happy is crucial to taking your gym to the top. If fighters get injured in training or fights, they may be out of commission for a while! Ther are over twenty injuries that take similar time to heal as they do in real life! Fighters also age and their performance will lessen as they get older. Procedurally generated game Every game is guaranteed to be different as fighters, coaches, and gyms are generated on the fly. Each game is different.",
