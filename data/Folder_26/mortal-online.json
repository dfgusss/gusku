    "About the game": "Experience true open-world freedom in Mortal Online - a unique first-person, medieval fantasy, massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Choose your path! Choose from many different races, decide your own style of play and whether to focus on PvP or PvE, both sharing the same game world. Choose a profession and devote your life to combat, crafting, magic, trading... Discover countless skills, resources and tools, master a few or dabble in them all, or be the first to explore new areas to find hidden treasures and unique secrets. Live or die! This game is not for the faint of heart. With 'full loot' mechanics, dying means that you risk losing everything you're carrying with you. Danger is everywhere, safety must be earned. Learn to master real-time, aim-based combat where you decide every move your character makes, and where your skills really matter. Not quite like any other MMORPG... There are no character levels, only skill levels. There are no PvP zones, only a single open and realistic world where you are free to choose your own path. There are no separate server regions, every player inhabits the same huge world. Strength in numbers! Build your own house, or create a guild with your friends to build a keep. Expand even more, build a whole city and surround it with defensive walls, or band together to siege and conquer your enemies' fortresses! With enough power, violence or diplomacy, you and your allies will be able to rule an entire nation. The possibilities are endless! Unlimited free trial! Mortal Online offers a free-to-play mode with a skill cap at skill level 60. In order to unlock the maximum skill levels and fully master your Mortal destiny, a paid monthly subscription is needed, but unlike many other games there are no microtransactions. Unsubscribing will re-apply the skill cap, but your skills will be maxed again when you re-subscribe. Every player gets one free character slot, and you can purchase additional slots up to a maximum of four.
