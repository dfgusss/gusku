    "About the game": "Mousey Mick is a 2D Platformer developed by Jackrifleman. In Mousey Mick, you run, jump, wall-jump, dodge and dash your way through wormhole doors. These doors allow people to travel to other nearby worlds within seconds. Each world introduces new challenges in one way or another; Whether it be precision jumps, or disgruntled knights of the Mayonnaise Kingdom. You may wonder why Mousey Mick is putting himself through such danger; the answer? Groceries. Mousey Mick is just trying to get some groceries, but he has a pretty lengthy commute seeing as the nearest thrift store is about 10 worlds away.",
