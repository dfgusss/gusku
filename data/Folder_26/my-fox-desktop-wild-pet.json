    "About the game": "'MY FOX' is a continuation of the 'WILD PET' project in which we take care of a small animal who gets to know the world with us. All of this is displayed as the desktop wallpaper so you can an eye on your fox. We are probably the only one presenting a similar project. The fox reacts to your commands, asks what to do when it sees something interesting. You can call him, stroke him and throw balls. The fox grows over time. You will start with a little fox that will grow and get bigger over time. We had a lot of inquiries about the possibility of taking care of another animal. The fox seemed perfect so we planned this sequel by building a new bigger world with new stories to discover. 'MY FOX' also allows you to transfer to the magical world. Main features: The game is displayed as wallpaper. Everything happens in the background while you are working on something else. Interactive little fox that will grow up. Take care of a little fox that will grow with age to discover new possibilities of the wild and magical world. It is up to you how the fox will grow up. More terrain and new opportunities. The new map will allow for longer exploration and new opportunities will allow the fox to move to the new magical world. Beautiful graphics with many settings. Relaxing graphics that are built to not burn your PC. A dedicated graphics card is recommended. Day and night system. The game changes the time of day your fox will react to and the darker night colours will not strain your eyes. Smaller features: The game will automatically start with your computer. The game will pause when you start another game to give you full computer power. The game supports multiple screens. Additionally, you can change the camera settings in the menu. Additional optimization that only generates objects that are visible. 'MY FOX' is created by our new extended team. New opportunities and new ideas should add variety to this beautiful game. We keep our fingers crossed for them. We're starting 'Early Access' to fine-tune this game. If you have any ideas or problems with the gameplay, please report them as topics on Steam. We thank the beta testers for their support and cooperation in creating this project. Peace, 3DM",
