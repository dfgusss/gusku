    "About the game": "Neo Cab is a visual novel about emotional survival in an automated world. You play as Lina, the last human cab driver. It’s your very first night driving the lonely streets of Los Ojos, and your best friend has just disappeared. Is she in grave danger... or just the flakiest friend ever? Either way, now you need to find cash, a place to crash, and some answers. Your only leads are the diverse cast of characters you pick up in your cab, but getting them to open up isn’t always easy. The anarchist punks don’t trust you, the corporate yuppies don’t see you, and the cops won’t leave you alone. But if you can balance honesty, empathy, and your own emotional health, you might just learn their secrets. Can you survive late-stage capitalism long enough to save your friend? STAY ON THE ROAD. STAY ON THE SEARCH. STAY HUMAN. Every pax is a puzzle. Whether you like them or not, everyone has their own story to tell. Lina’s best course for survival is to keep driving. Piece together what has happened to Savy as you help Lina navigate the city grid. Each passenger interaction will affect Lina’s mood; as her emotions become more intense, some choices will be taken away, while other choices will be unlocked. Neo Cab features a branching narrative with pax stories written by Leigh Alexander, Kim Belair, Bruno Dias, Duncan Fyfe, Paula Rogers &amp; Robin Sloan. Featuring an original soundtrack by Obfusc (Monument Valley, House of Cards)",
