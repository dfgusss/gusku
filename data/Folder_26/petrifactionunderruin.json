    "About the game": "feature Bishoujo characters change to various materials (freezing, petrification, waxing, golden, tree-making, soaping, etc ...) Erosion expands with each shot and animation slows down (attack avoidance difficulty also increases!) Human bosses can also end the battle without defeating them by action (the ending branches accordingly) Japanese anime style model In order to express the speed of the enemy and ally while being based on RPG, I quote the battle system of a famous indie game Since the emphasis is on viewing abnormal conditions, the play time will be around 1 hour when checking all routes. Please note. More details Root, a rare user of freezing magic, is suddenly kidnapped one day and throws himself into a battle called 'consolidation death game'. However, this game was a mysterious one that could proceed without defeating humans by solving the gimmick. What kind of ending is waiting for the selection of the character and route that the player controls? Press the button at the right time to attack! Avoid enemy attacks like STG! Be careful as the movement speed will slow down when attacked! Even if you are not good at STG, you can ease the difficulty by selecting equipment and level! Various options for abnormal condition production Expression of erosion during state change (mottled, even, from top to bottom) Change the expression for each material (4 to 10 types depending on the material) Soapy foam expression (5 types including none) Presence or absence of freezing cold air expression Material when attacked by an enemy whose material is not specified",
