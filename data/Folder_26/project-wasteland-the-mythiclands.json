    "Release date": "Oct 14, 2019",
    "About the game": "Explore a large open world, fight monsters and search chests for supplies to upgrade your home base and gear up to fight various levels of bosses for epic loot. Enhance your chances of victory by brewing potions, enchanting equipment, and building the perfect set of gear. In the world you will find interesting stories and bits of lore explaining how the world fell apart and as you find these bits of information they are stored in a journal which also contains a Beastiary that gives information on the variety of monsters you have faced. Project Wasteland: The Mythiclands, is the second chapter in the Project Wasteland series. The lack of mercenaries in The Wasteland has caused the dimension to collapse due to the on-going wars between Fox Tech, Coyote Corp. and the invading of Demons...and Aliens. All human life has been wiped from the wasteland, but the death does not stop there. The rifts created from the demon armies have allowed the corrupting fog of death to seep from The Wasteland into The Mythiclands. You play as a villager that managed to secure themselves a pocket dimension to live inside of, but the catch is that this pocket dimension has almost nothing. You will need to return to the now corrupted Mythiclands to scavenge supplies to build your home and while you are there, investigate ways to reverse the effects of the corruption. Beware though, without magical intervention your body will succumb to the fog if you are there for too long. Fight through monsters, scavenge supplies, and fight off players with ill intentions in this survival/exploration evolution on the Project Wasteland universe.",
