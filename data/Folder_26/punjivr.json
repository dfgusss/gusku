    "About the game": "PunjiVR, a hardcore tactical shooter set during the Vietnam War In PunjiVR, you will assume the role of different soldiers from all sides of the conflict throughout the game's many missions. Whether you're clearing out a Viet Cong tunnel, sabotaging US fortifications, setting up an ambush, or just taking part in a large battle, there is no shortage of excitement to be had. Vietnam is a diverse land, with the mountainous Central Highlands, sprawling urban cities, and muggy swamps of the Mekong Delta just to name a few. PunjiVR strives to cover all of these environments and more, offering unique and unforgettable experiences for each. Experience the Vietnam War like never before. Gameplay PunjiVR aims to create a challenging and realistic experience . With death being only a bullet or two away, realistic bullet ballistics and penetration, lifelike AI that fight smart and are deadly, and the occasional trap, a tactical mindset is a must. Nearly everything is physics based, including the full player body, hands, interactables, AI, and more! The wide array of firearms were designed to behave realistically while still allowing players unfamiliar with in-depth weapon mechanics to successfully operate them. Adjustable difficulty settings, like player health and enemy presence, lets the player match their skill and/or comfort level to gameplay. Tons of Toys, Tools, &amp; Traps! Sneak in with an smg, lay an ambush with traps and a belt-fed machine gun, or pick them off from a distance with a sniper rifle! Bullet Ballistics Just because there's something between you and the muzzle of your opponent's rifle doesn't mean you're safe! Bullets can penetrate objects and are dependent on the diameter, weight, and speed of the bullet as well as the angle on impact and material of the object . Not only do bullets pierce materials, they can also ricochet, drop over time and distance, and spread after impact . Just because the small handgun caliber was stopped by your cover doesn't mean the next rifle round will be! Join the Community! / --- There is no teleportation as a comfort option due to the way each level and gameplay as a whole was designed. Please keep in mind that PunjiVR is still in Early Access. The game is constantly being worked on and improved. If you have any issues, please let me know through a steam forum post, or in a message at one of the links above. Flyable helicopters and an urban scene as shown in the trailer or currently not in the game, but they will be included in future updates.",
