    "About the game": "The game is a linear visual novel. It has a few choices, but they do not have an impact on the ending, instead they provide different content to the reader. Join Folken as he starts his first adventure in a world that is reigned by magic. Dive into the complex world of this fantasy story and discover creatures, lore, abilities and a lot of characters with unique personalities. Gained feedback from the community will help me improve future chapter releases. There are 11 CG's to unlock. A single playthrough takes about 3 to 4 hours. Story The story revolves around Folken, who is considered a low-class human by society, because he has no magic abilities. In this world, people with magic abilities are automatically vested with high privileges and the rest are not worth much and are being discriminated against. Folken has no family and has to fight for his survival each and every day. But his life changes when an old man claims to have known his father, who was a legend and had incredible powers. Does he actually have powers slumbering inside of him that he wasn't aware of? Can he change the hierarchy of this world that has treated him so badly throughout his life?
