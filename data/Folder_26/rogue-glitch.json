Develop your character each run with random items ranging from incremental stat modifiers to lethal showers of bullets.

Play solo or up to four players to conquer the Glitchworld. Features Solo play and local co-op (Online Co-op with DLC) 120 unique items to collect 12 character variants each with upgrading stats and skins A narrative told through completion events Movement Fluid movement is the core component to making a platforming focused roguelite. Auto-targeting projectiles will fire as you remain within proximity of enemies and a downward stomp allows you increase your damage output. Learn the different enemy types and behaviours to achieve a devastating finesse in combat. Progression Rogue Glitch is packed with unlockable items, characters and cosmetics to make every run a worthwhile one. Experience is awarded based on performance which will provide random item unlocks on level-ups.
