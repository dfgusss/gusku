    "About the game": "Every game is different from the potions available in chests to the orientation of levels and bosses. Chest and enemy spawn points and quantities are randomized for every level as well. Rogue Party brings the anticipation of random dungeon crawling to the next level with a highly interactive multiplayer experience. Work together by using potions on one another, exploiting enemy weaknesses and building your equipment to complement the team. Or go it alone, taking on the Dungeon of Doom all by yourself. 'Drop in, Drop Out' multiplayer features mean that your friends can join at any time during the first level of the game and, if anyone quits, the adventure can continue unaffected. Every door could lead to a mundane hallway, epic room full of loot or a soul crushing boss.",
