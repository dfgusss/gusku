'Rosenkreuzstilette Freudenstachel' is the sequel to 'Rosenkreuzstilette', a level-based 2D side scrolling action game for PC. STORY Thousands of years have passed since 'magic' was lost to the people. Now there are but a few who even know of its existence. Those who possessed magical abilities were faced with persecution. Several months have passed since Count Zeppelin's ill-fated rebellion against the Holy Empire and the Orthodox Church. Rebuilding the damage caused by Rosenkreuzstilette, the Pope issues a solemn decree: that all Magi are to be considered menaces to society and enemies of the state. Establishing his own strike force of magic-users loyal to the faith, Schwarzkreuz, the Pope and his followers set out to put an end to the last of the resistance. Spiritia Rosenberg, the plucky young woman responsible for quashing the Count's uprising, is among the first to be captured during Schwarzkreuz's witch hunt. As Freudia Neuwahl, Spritia's lifelong friend, you must ensure the safety of the surviving members of Rosenkreuzstilette, put an end to Schwarzkreuz and the Pope's oppression of the Magi, and bring Spiritia home...
