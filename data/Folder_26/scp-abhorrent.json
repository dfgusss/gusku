    "About the game": "Play as Agent Sigma, an operative assigned to a GOC assessment team. In a mission to exterminate an uncontained SCP-363 instance located in an abandoned mining tunnel - the situation suddenly goes critical. With communication broken and fellow agents now assumed KIA/MIA, Agent Sigma's new objective is simply to escape alive. Utilize fluorescent spray-paint to mark your progress, a motion-tracking camera to peer through walls, and a flamethrower to torch SCP-363 instances. If it comes down to the last draw, accurate aim with your sidearm might be your last resort. Survive and scavenge for ammunition and supplies - find the ladder and escape the tunnels. Game Features: • Built in Unreal Engine 4. • Fully Procedurally Generated Map. Every playthrough is completely random each time you play, catering to a unique experience for every player. • No saves. An unforgiving gameplay experience, death means restarting again from the beginning. • Original Voice Acting, Soundtracks, and 3D Art Assets. Game Updates and Future Content: SCP: Abhorrent will have future patch releases for bug-fixes and additional game content.",
