    "About the game": "Hello everyone! We're honored and humbled to be allowed on Steam. We realize and recognize the issues that a lot of Steam Early Access games go through. That being said, if you are expecting a final and complete experience, do not buy this game . The game will be undergoing a lot of changes with our new community's guidance and support. If you are still interested — buying this game does fund it to make it a better game. We want to work with you to make it better! Let's talk! We do not plan on banning users on our Community Discussion page. We do expect some level of civility, but we will not be enforcing any rules at this time. We want to hear all of it. —————————————————————————————————————————————————————— SilverQuest: Gaiden is retro dungeon crawling at its purest. FM Synth sounds and music bring you deep into a world of dungeon exploration where each game is a new experience! All art, items, enemies … everything is exposed outside of the game, meaning anyone can add, remove or change anything in the game. Add 1,000 monsters, quests, release your own mod-pack, anything! Mod-packs are officially supported, and can be downloaded on the Steam Workshop page when they are available. Our game is a great way to start learning how games work. We encourage you to tinker with everything! Thank you for your time, understanding and interest. We'll see you on the Community Discussion page!
