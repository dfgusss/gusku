    "About the game": "In Singled Out you must identify your target in a crowd of weirdos before time runs out. The quicker you are, the higher you score! You have 10 seconds to shoot the GALACTIC SUPERCRIMINAL. Identify the target using the 3 descriptions provided. Only one person in the crowd has all 3 traits. Don't shoot the wrong one! Singled Out is a short, simple but challenging arcade game where the goal is simply to beat your high score, climb the leaderboards, or last as long as you can. It's ideal for 5 minute breaks or parties (where everyone can work together and yell at the person playing). Features 10 million randomly-generated weirdos. 30 challenging levels and a final boss. Family Friendly Mode: remove all references to violence and shooting for an experience better suited to younger players. Practice Mode: disable the strict time limit to practice in a casual, stress-free environment. Memory Mode: unlock this challenge mode to truly put your skills to the test. Steam Leaderboards. Steam Achievements. Steam Cloud support for save files. Check out my other games on Steam too!",
