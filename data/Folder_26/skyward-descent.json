    "About the game": "Skyward Descent is not the next big thing. It's a game you pick up, play for a while, then put down to go about your day. Then tomorrow, you'll be looking for something to do and go 'that Skybound Ascension game was actually pretty good' so you pick it up, play it, and before you know it it's your new 'go to' game. Item Synergies - After each round you get to choose between 3 items. It's up to you to discover what combinations work well together and break the run in half! Jet - Both a means of fight and flight, the jet is a way to flow through the sky elegantly dodging enemies whilst also setting them on fire. Ouch. Bosses - They're very tough. Challenge Runs - Built a tier list for the items? Now throw it out the window. The various challenges force you to completely re-evaluate the items as you know them, you'll need to develop new strategies to stand a chance.",
