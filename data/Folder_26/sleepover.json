    "About the game": "In SLEEPOVER, you're either the Slasher or the Homeowner. The Slasher is loud, wearing boots and equipped with a Knife. The Slasher doesn't play nice and is someone you should avoid as the Homeowner. The Homeowner is quiet, equipped with only their bare hands. Don't underestimate the Homeowner though... if the Homeowner sneaks up on the Slasher, it's lights out. The Slasher has a knife though so be careful if you're the Homeowner. You can try and use the Lightswitches to make a room light or dark. Try and hide behind furniture or jump out a window. The Homeowner's house is small, but has many entrances. You've got three minutes until the police arrive to save the Homeowner. If the Homeowner spends too much time hiding, the Slasher will steal their stuff and leave to win the round. SLASHER *Loud *Has a Knife *Dark Clothes *Bright Mask HOMEOWNER *Quiet *Does not have a Knife *Can Choke-hold Slasher from behind",
