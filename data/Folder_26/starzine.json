Key Features Truly 3D playfields Animated and innovative stage design explores the limits of 3D playfields. Unique player viewpoint Unique player viewpoint, just behind the paddle, places the player inside the action. Fluid, intuitive and minimal control scheme Ball smashing, aftertouch and heightwise movement augment the classic left-right paddle controls. Maximum ball control Thrust forward to smash the ball and accelerate it and accurately alter its trajectory using aftertouch to get the ball where you want it.
