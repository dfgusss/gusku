Each contains authentic naval systems including Sonar, Radar and Target Motion Analysis. Test your skills while firing Tomahawk missiles, rescuing crippled subs, rising through the polar ice cap to communicate information and much more. Easy to use game interface - With straightforward controls and automated crewmen, controlling a submarine has never been easier. Enhanced sound and 3D graphics engine - 3D Objects (over 250), from Russian trawlers to France's Mirage fighters - plus exacting sound modes pull you in like never before. You won't just hear the torpedos, you will feel them.",
