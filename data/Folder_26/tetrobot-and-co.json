Learn how pipes, lasers, fans and other electronic devices work, learn how to alter the chemical properties of slime, and collect all the memory blocks that you find on the way. The owners of damaged Tetrobots all around the world rely on us because we are the only people who can repair their precious robots. Key Features Pure puzzle gameplay for gamers who like to give their minds a workout. Over 50 levels to play and even more secrets to unlock.
