    "Release date": "Aug 30, 2021",
    "About the game": "The Curse of Feldar Vale is set on the world of Qaedon, a thousand years before the Great Cataclysm. Known as the Age of Chaos, humans, greenskins, and all manner of monsters fight to survive these troubled times. The once peaceful Vale is now beset with evil creatures and dark deeds as an ancient curse is unleashed on the land. Build a party of 4-6 characters to adventure across the vale to seek fame and fortune or more likely find just enough coin to put food on the plate. The Curse of Feldar Vale delivers old-school gaming with retro hand-drawn 2D graphics throughout. If you can lift The Curse, export your party to the next adventure - Mystery at Morgoth (in development, coming Q3 2022). Hours of game play with multiple locations to visit and numerous quests to undertake. Build your party from traditional D&amp;D races (Human, Elf, Dwarf, Half-Elf, or Halfling). Use your Warriors to batter the enemy, your Rogues to sneak up unseen, or your Clerics to Turn the Undead. Get power and magic with your Battlemages or pure magic with your combat-weak Mages. Recruit single or multi-class units like the Warrior/Rogue. Tactical turn-based encounters on square grids where every decision counts. Adventure in overland locations, explore buildings, or battle in dark dungeons. Keep your party supplied (hungry heroes do not fight as efficiently as well-fed ones!). Hundreds of items for your party to find. Dozens of spells for your Battlemages, Clerics, and Mages to blast the enemy or help your party. Fill your coffers with Qaedi (the global currency) by looting your enemies. Permanent death for units unless you can afford Resurrection!! Dozens of options to customize gameplay. Optional advanced rules to change the way you play. Customize each member of your party as they level up through combat experience. Dozens of attributes for each unit covering their physical quality, abilities, movement, protection, and combat modifiers. Equip your units with all manner of goodies using a variable inventory with up to 23 slots per unit. Build spellbooks for your spellcasters from three Schools of Magic - Arcane, Divine, and Planar. Battle dozens of foes, many of them based on original D&amp;D creatures. Deal with Traps both mechanical and magical. Detailed In-Game Player Guides (Item Directory, Spell Compendium). Help System for every spell, item, and ability. Customizable Tooltip System. ...and so much more!",
