    "About the game": "As the sun emerges from the endless ocean, the villagers pray that the Giant will grace them with good deeds and a helping hand. The Giant of Torridge Island is a sandbox game in which you can either help or hinder life on an island. The Giant can pick up almost anything and can make the objects interact in a variety of ways by placing them next to each other. These interactions will affect life and nature on the island in both positive and negative ways. The villagers pray into the night, hoping the Giant will not return tomorrow. Whether you plant trees or chop them down, help build houses or destroy them, breed animals or hunt them, your influence will be felt by all, and ultimately determine the fate of the island and all the inhabitants of it. Just as The Giant molds the village, the villagers mold The Giant, every good deed delivered upon the residents will grant a star, while every bad deed inflicted will grant a tear. Collecting enough for either will make the Giant grow and make them more powerful, granting a variety of effects from faster movement to increased lifting ability. The Giant grows through the emotions of the villagers, learning how to further their happiness or misery. The Giant appears unmoved by which of the two is inflicted upon the islanders. Whether you want to slowly build up a village with sprawling wildlife or destroy everything that has been built before, there are a variety of ways to play. Currently there are 2 game modes available: Free-Play mode - over as many days as you'd like, shape the island to your liking and become the hero or the villain of the village. Challenge mode - a faster way to experience the game, you have 1 day to be as good or evil as possible while dealing with a variety of predicaments, from presents falling from the sky to tornadoes frequently ravaging the population. With constant content updates adding new tribes, maps and abilities for the Giant to employ, there will always be something new to discover on Torridge island.",
