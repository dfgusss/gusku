    "About the game": "The Kaiju Offensive is a 2D topdown brawler game. Players fight as a giant monster in this arcade style game. You descend upon Earth and reap utter destruction in your attempt to destroy civilization. Your objective is plain and simple. You, the kaiju, need to destroy all of the buildings in the city. You are The BIG Trouble in The Kaiju Offensive... You fight as a kaiju while humans and their ground defenses attempt to take you down. Choose one of the four kaiju: The Queen, The Slime, The Ship, or The Unknown. The kaiju have different play styles. Some of the kaiju use only the keyboard while others use a keyboard and mouse combination. Choose the kaiju that suits you the best. Test your kaiju’s strengths, learn its weaknesses, and adapt your fighting style to achieve victory. Pay attention to your health and power bars, as some kaiju are unable to heal. When you are a novice player, you may need to restart the game repeatedly until you master your kaiju's moves and tactics. Select your kaiju and start obliterating everything in your path.",
