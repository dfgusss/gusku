    "About the game": "Art like never before. The Kremer Museum is an innovative new museum concept that combines the newest VR technology with world-class Old Master paintings. The museum includes pieces by Rembrandt, Aelbert Cuyp, Frans Hals and many more Old Masters from the Dutch Golden Age. Walk around a fantastic new space, where the balance between traditional museums and VR is represented through a new sort of architecture. Be sure to check out Rembrandt’s “old man with a turban”, walk through it, and see the original back of the panel, to explore the work’s unique stamps of provenance. Designed by architect Johan van Lierop, Founder of Architales and developed by MOYOSA MEDIA from the Netherlands, the museum features 74 Dutch and Flemish Old Master paintings from the Dutch Golden Age, and is accessible exclusively through VR. History and future of the power of art combined. Get up close and personal with the paintings, examine brushwork and colors in great detail, and listen to George &amp; Ilone Kremer - the founders of the collection - explain what is special about each painting. George Kremer: “Our journey as collectors has always been about finding the highest quality artworks and simultaneously finding ways to share them with as many people as possible. My wife Ilone and I believe we can make a greater contribution to the art world by investing in technology rather than in bricks and mortar for our collection.” “First there were museums, then private museums and now virtual reality privately owned museums are entering the scene” Melanie Gerlis, Financial Times “Virtual Reality Museum Puts Rembrandt in High-Def” - Molly Schuetz, Bloomberg - “The Newest Home for Rembrandt and the Dutch Masters Is Gorgeous Outer-Space Museum” - Brian Boucher, artnet “At the new Kremer Museum, the lighting is perfectly optimized to accentuate the colors, brushstrokes, and details in each painting” - Sarah Burke Artsy “By far the best VR experience I’ve seen so far” - Nikolaus Weil, Entrepreneur (Mindex, SingularityU Germany) &amp; Film Producer - Earth and Deep Blue Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
