From a decade ago, by the creator of To the Moon and Finding Paradise : A 30-minute experimental adventure game about a faceless girl stuck inside a house with no door to the outside. A short play fitting for a single sitting. A lousy original soundtrack consisting of one single tune. An abstract experience that you hereby agree not to sue the developer for.",
