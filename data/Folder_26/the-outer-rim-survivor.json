    "About the game": "Welcome to The Outer Rim , where fast paced action and space combat meet. The Outer Rim: Survivo r is an early access version giving you a taste of what is to come. Play the Survivor missions where you'll be constantly bombarded with enemies to attack, and be attacked by - How long you can last is the question as these missions never end. The Campaign mode (single player mission based game play) will be added as a DLC once completed. A range of missions are available for you to try for free and give feedback while I further develop the game. Take control of 5 different space ships with 9 different weapons flying in a full 3D universe. Missions include: protect your command ships, take out enemy command ships, and protect bomber runs. The missions take place in a mix of locations including space &amp; planets. Collect power ups by taking out enemies ships, giving you a range of items to help you last longer - extra missiles, new weapons, flares, nukes, multi-shot missiles and more. Command your Wingmen (on certain missions) to help you last longer - they can attack the targets you specify, defend you when you're in trouble, just tell them what you want them to do. They've got your back!",
