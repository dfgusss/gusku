    "About the game": "The Summoning This experience can be classified as a psychological and atmospheric horror game. However... This isn't a game... It looks like a game, but it's as real as it gets... Remember all of the urban legends from your childhood? Bloody Mary, Candy Man, even the modern day Slender Man ? Imagine if it was all real, but we just weren't performing the right rituals to summon these beings from another realm... What if our childhood nightmares were all real, we just weren't ready to bring them into our world? Well, for those willing, brave, or foolish enough, The Summoning presents the possibility for you to do just that... This experience is not for the faint of heart. You will need access to a few things, such as a writing utensil, paper, a dark room, and a mirror. Can you get through all of the tasks in the game and perform them aloud? Can you manage to survive this experience alone? You may bring a friend if you wish, or dare a friend to do this experience, but be warned... This is a once in a lifetime experience... It must be done properly and instructions followed precisely for it to work... But it does in fact work... Good luck to all who are brave enough to endure this nightmare. I'm sorry to all who are not prepared but just don't realize it yet... Features: Perform Tasks Aloud for the ultimate atmospheric horror... The only game of its kind... It's not virtual-reality, it's ACTUAL reality... Tried, tested, proven to scare you if you dare to follow all of the tasks presented... Perform written and oral tasks aloud to bring nightmares to life... Short experience that offers memories that will last a lifetime... Experience this on your own or with multiple friends in the same room... All for the low, low cost of your sanity...",
