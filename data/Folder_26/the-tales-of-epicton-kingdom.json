    "About the game": "• Switch between casual gameplay and visual novel for an even more interactive experience. • Environments and characters are designed in a simple, yet beautiful pixel art style. • Casual games (incomplete) throughout the adventure will be unique and challenging that will test a variety of abilities in order to progress. • Read the story from multiple perspectives. • Delve deep into a world that slowly becomes more and more engaging and compelling as you progress. More and more refugees are being admitted to the great city, Epicton Kingdom from the neighbouring villages. Word was spreading through the kingdom that the pigs they have left to breed on their own had mutated and started attacking and chasing after the human beings. There were rumours of pigs living not far outside of the kingdom so the King sent out a small search party to investigate.",
