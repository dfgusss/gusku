    "About the game": "Toxastra is a science fiction top-down shooter-RPG where you take control of Dale Custer—the chief of security aboard the CFV Janus, a ship of colonization mining. After an explosion that has plunged you into a coma, you wake up in the chaos of the ship invaded by mutants. Main features: - Play your way Choose the characteristics of your character from the start in relation to your playing style. Use the many firearms at your disposal, hand-to-hand combat, and DNA powers to face the dangers that the game contains. Improve your physical, mental, and other abilities to personalize the way you tackle obstacles on the ship. - Exploration Exploring the different parts of the ship is essential for collecting both ammunitions and other resources necessary for your survival. Find access cards, vending machines, and secret areas to make your adventure easier. - A dark atmosphere A vessel for colonization—the CFV Janus—includes everything necessary to transport workers on a long journey to their new planets while minimizing the travel costs for the company. A park, a swimming pool, a relaxation area, and much more could form an idyllic setting to spend your free time on such a long journey, but all this has to give way to the smell of blood, putrefaction, and mold. Bright lights give way to shaky lights and dark corners, and the ambient noises of a ship's life fall silent, leaving only a deadly silence.",
