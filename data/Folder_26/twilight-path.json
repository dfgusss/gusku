Twilight Path draws on inspiration from beloved films such as Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke, The Dark Crystal and The Neverending Story. Transported to a surreal realm between the real world and the afterlife, you awaken to discover you have become trapped in this mystical spirit world. You'll come to learn that your only path home leads through ancient and abandoned Great Wheel. Along the way, the unlikely companions will encounter a land of beauty, mystery, and life. Only by restoring the world to balance can you return to the life you left behind. Charm Games is a small independent studio of industry veterans from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
