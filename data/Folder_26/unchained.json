    "About the game": "Society has fallen under the control of a company named Vitron. Vitron offers a product that links directly to people's minds, making it incredibly powerful in controlling brain chemistry and how a person perceives the world. It makes people feel happy and fulfilled while censoring out the parts of the world that they do not want to see. Because of the product's mind controlling nature, in combination with its mental censorship, humanity has become completely brainwashed. Vitron's control over the world increases each day as more people become reliant on their devices. Until you come along. You play as Jake, the main character of the game who starts out in a brainwashed mindset. It is ultimately your choice and awareness that continues the story-line. If you decide to progress the story, you meet the leader of an underground rebellion group that is trying to overthrow Vitron and remove the CEO from power. After explaining his initiative and Vitron's full background, you are given the choice to join in the fight against Vitron. Key Features: 2D Cover System - Who likes getting shot at? Go behind various cover objects to protect yourself from enemy gunshots. Swing out of cover at any time to shoot at enemies. Be aware that enemies can do the same. Weapons - 14 weapons with their own unique stats. Choose carefully between various weapon accuracies, fire rates, damages, and special weapon features. Phone - Make a phone call by accessing your contacts or by dialing a number. You are also able to send/receive messages through the messaging icon, or by going to your contacts list. Laptop - Use a computer while you're on your computer. The laptop comes with an email system and fully functioning in-game internet. Need to check your emails? Open up your laptop and press the emails icon. The in-game internet features an online weapons shop, where you can look at weapon stats and purchase whatever weapons/ammo you may need. Running low on cash? Test your luck at the Oulala Online Casino, featuring a slots machine and blackjack table. What will separate you from the rest of society? Will you join the fight for something you believe in? Will you fall to the masses as the rest of society has? With a carefully crafted story-line and over 10 side missions, it is up to you and your efforts to make the world... Unchained.",
