    "Release date": "Feb 12, 2020",
    "About the game": "“Sex, drugs, and leveling up!” Victim Cache: The RPG is a parody of popular Japanese role playing games from the 1980s and 1990s, such as Final Fantasy I-VI and Dragon Warrior I-IV. Although the game play, story, and graphical style mimic RPGs of that era, Victim Cache: The RPG features mature humor, themes, and language. The gameplay is modeled after classic JRPGs. Players can move their characters up, down, left, or right on a top down 2D map to explore the 8-bit towns, dungeons, and overworld. Along the way, players must talk to archetypal non-player characters to advance the quest lines. Battles are fought from a side view perspective in which the player can choose to attack, cast a spell, execute a special attack, use an item, or later in the game summon additional allies to help. Battles are won when all enemies hit points have reached zero.",
