    "About the game": "VRAstroSmash was originally designed for the Vive Cosmos, but it is compatible with the Oculus Quest 2, Rift -S, Vive Pro, Cosmos Elite, and Valve Index. Hints from the Developer Keep your eyes on the radar. The size of the radar dots are actually scaled. If the large green dot is off the radar, you are getting close to the ion field, of which will cost you points. If you travel too far through the ion field, you will be returned to the center. When weapons get a little hot they refuse to fire. Turning off Target Assist will help in cooling. Moving forward will also cool weapons down. If you have Target Assist off and are also moving forward, the weapons will rapidly cool. When asteroids get small they will be attracted to the density of the ship, and follow you. There is an alert of a flashing red cockpit which is a warning an asteroid is close. The map on the left of the cockpit dashboard will show you where the asteroids are, of which are closing in on you. Overdrive requires 10 points to use. If you do not have any points it will not activate. This game is a sit back relax arcade style; however, as you approach 40 000 points, asteroids will spawn faster creating a more intense feel for the game. Retromode does just that gives a retro arcade feel to the game. It also shows some space junk that may be difficult to see. Type of asteroids Plasma, Crystal, Iron, Rock. Every plasma asteroid destroyed will automatically increase ship controlls, turning, pitch and barrel roll. Every crystal asteroid destroyed will increase the cooling rate of the weapons. Every iron asteroid destroyed will repair/ ship damage. After 6 asteroids are destroyed Auto Fire will engage. At this point Every Phase will then increase the fire rate of rapid fire. Points are achieved by every bullet that hits an asteroid, and every asteroid destroyed, destroying space junk and the UFO are the highest point value. The UFO will not show up until 6000 points have been achieved, of which afterwards should most likely appear once pe game phase. Space junk will most likely appear once per game phase.",
