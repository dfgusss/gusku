    "About the game": "Warfare 1944 is a stylized tactical shooter featuring infantry combat, large scale environments, and dynamically changing objectives that encourage teamwork and coordination. Warfare 1944 focuses on tactical gameplay. Bullets are deadly, one shot can kill. Team communication is essential and Warfare 1944 features robust proximity voice communication which allows you to communicate with your fellow soldiers alongside you. Wield a wide variety of weapons and equipment while you attempt surviving the chaos of war. Rally your friends to your team, and fight in massive battles across vast open landscapes. Keep your wits, and defeat your enemies. Warfare is unforgiving. Warfare 1944 is inspired by a number games we adore. Our art style is inspired by the gorgeous tactical shooter Due Process. ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ Mission objectives and team-play mechanics are similar to the visceral tactical shooter Squad. ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ Weapon handling is similar to the iconic Red Orchestra series. ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ Lastly, our maps are all deeply influenced by the legendary Battlefield 1942. Our mission is to create an epic, tactical, large scale, spiritual successor to classic World War II tactical shooters`. We also enjoy single-player games such as Ravenfield ⁽ˡᶦⁿᵏ⁾ and are focusing on creating a robust single-player experience in future updates. Warfare 1944 is built on top of our OHDCore framework for Unreal Engine 4. This framework is used by Drakeling Labs to build games for our community, including free games such as Operation: Harsh Doorstop. Supporting Warfare 1944 allows us to continue developing OHDCore, which allows us to release more features (for free) to our community through games like Operation: Harsh Doorstop. We hope you enjoy Warfare 1944 and continue to support our mission to make great games for our loyal community members. We look forward to seeing you on the battlefield.",
