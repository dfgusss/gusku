    "About the game": "WordMaster is a simple word making game. A round lasts 1 minute with 7 randomly selected letters (with at least a single vowel among them). You score points by creating long words or by using letters that are used less frequently in English. You may repeat letters within a word. The trailer shows exactly what the game is and takes you through a full round, post game, and leaderboard update. For example: Suppose our round letters are W I N E R S L. We could spell wines, winners, sewers, sinners etc. Here is a breakdown of the scoring: Letter points: AEIOULNSTR = 1 pt DG = 2 pts BCMP = 3 pts FHVWY = 4 pts K = 5 pts JX = 8 pts QZ = 10 pts Word length: 3 letters = 1 pt 4 letters = 2 pts 5 letters = 3 pts 6 letters = 5 pts 7 letters = 8 pts 8 or more letters = 10 pts This is my first attempt at coding. I'm a teacher and wanted something my students could play that would be somewhat educational.",
