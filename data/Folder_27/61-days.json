    "About the game": "61 days is an adventure game set on an alien planet. The crew of a spaceship crash-land after flying too close to large world known only as HB137F. Luckily, there are few casualties and the atmosphere is survivable, but they soon discover that in exactly 61 days the temperature is set to plummet to unbearable cold. Their only hope lies with an expedition a century ago, which perished but managed to use alien technology to build fuel cells to generate heat and power. Now the clock is ticking to find these artifacts and use them to build a base that will help you brave the winter. Ultimately, your goal is to collect these energy cells. Along the way you will face platforming challenges as well as puzzle and fighting segments. You will also have to make decisions, sometimes as the ship's captain, that will affect the health of your colony and your overall chances of survival.",
