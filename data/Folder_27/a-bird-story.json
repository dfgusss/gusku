    "About the game": "Note: This is not To the Moon's sequel, but rather a small experimental project. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- From the creator of To the Moon and Finding Paradise: A simple, wordless 1-hour short about a boy who found an injured bird, told through a blur between reality and imagination. A Bird Story is an interactive pixel animation with the sole purpose of telling a simple story. It is a standalone narrative, with its own beginning and ending. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- A word of caution from the devs: This is an experimental and somewhat polarizing project, particularly for fans of To the Moon &amp; Finding Paradise. As a guarantee with all games from Freebird, there is a 100% personal (confidential) refund policy with no questions asked; even if it just isn't your cup of tea. Details here. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Key Features A story-driven experience with no dialogues A mix between adventure game elements and classic RPG aesthetics An original soundtrack tailored to the narrative An espresso execution with no time drains",
