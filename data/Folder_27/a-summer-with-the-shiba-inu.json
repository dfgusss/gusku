    "About the game": "A Summer with the Shiba Inu is a visual novel with interactive, meaningful choices. When Syd the Shiba Inu returns to Shiba Island after a ten year absence, she sets off a chain of events that overturns the lives of all the dogs she had left behind. She gets back in touch with her old friend, Max, and along the way meets a mysterious Labrador retriever named Quei-Li. (What’s a Lab doing on the Island, anyway?) They are her only remaining allies as she tries to survive the past that made her leave the Island in the first place. 3 main endings for Syd, with 10+ endings for other dogs depending on your actions! Visual novel with story wordcount of ~70,000 Random facts about dogs in menus 30 Steam achievements Dog bark button in preference menu Demo available - please see our website. An emulated instance made so that Reality can be reallocated amongst the dogs of the Island. This allocation is based on ranking, and therefore how good a dog is. It could be said that the ranking based on these ARInas maintains the social order. And it is in my best interests to ensure that I have the highest ranking possible. I will fight tooth and claw for it, because only then can I gain freedom... Streaming / Recording Streaming and recording the game is permitted.
