Experience the tactical richness of fully-destructible environments and procedurally-generated campaigns. And when the apocalypse ends, create and play your own mods! Key features: Mercenaries for hire: Hire and upgrade your ragtag group of snipers, demolition teams, orbital bombardment crews, and more. No two cities are the same: Cities are procedurally-generated, giving a unique experience with each playthrough. Destructible environments: You can absolutely blow up everything. Play with friends: Up to three people can cooperatively play together. Mod support: Mix and modify the game rules however you like.",
