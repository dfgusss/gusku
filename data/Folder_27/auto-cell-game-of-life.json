    "About the game": "Auto Cell Auto Cell are developed based on life games. It consists of a simple grid. Each left mouse click will increase or decrease a grid, or use a new file in the file list. In any case, it will evolve according to simple rules. You can preview 3D stacked cells. With the right grid combination, it will have an amazing effect. Life Game [/] In 1970, John Conway of Cambridge University compiled the game program, which is controlled by several simple rules. However, the combination of these rules can make the program produce unpredictable structure and dynamics The game of \\'life\\' operates in a two-dimensional grid world. Each grid can be regarded as a small life body. It has two states: survival or death. John Horton Conway (1937–2020) Stephen Hawking [The Grand Design] [/] We can imagine that things like life games, with only some basic laws, may produce highly complex functions and even intelligence. It may require a grid of billions of squares, but this is not surprising. There are hundreds of billions of cells in our brain. Rules are now supported [/] Now only B3 / S23 rules are supported. Other rules will be updated later. About creative workshops [/] You can upload and share your creations in the creative workshop or download and watch others' creations. Subsequent creative workshops will support custom rules. Support If you have any questions, you can send an email to : leosue.onemore@gmail.com",
