    "About the game": "BH Trials is an obstacle course game where players drive a Backhoe digger with no transmission, steering, or brakes: the only way to control it is through the digger’s arms. The game features several game modes with varied challenges both in single player and up to 4 player Co-op. Solo Player: The trials BH Trials’ single player mode features a series of increasingly difficult levels, designed to try both your dexterity and your wit. You will drive and climb and crawl, manipulating all kinds of platforms and mechanisms and avoiding devious contraptions, all while trying to reach the end as fast as possible to unlock new levels and game modes. Multiplayer: The Spider The star of BH Trials’ multiplayer levels is four-legged Backhoe Spider. Up to four players can control this beast, either on a single computer or online through Steam Together, pitting their teamwork skills against some of the game’s most treacherous climbs. Note: It’s also possible to play these levels alone -if you’re up to the extra challenge! Collectibles Galore Hidden in every level is a miniature digger, roaming around in the most unexpected, hard to reach spots. Collecting these toys rewards you with new game modes and Multiplayer areas, so it pays off to keep your eyes peeled and your ears sharp. Leaderboards BHT includes both friend and global leaderboards so you can measure your skills against players worldwide. Let the games begin! Ghost in the Machine BHT keeps track of your best performances and stores them as a ghost that you can summon when you replay levels. Compete against yourself to improve your times, get the three stars and make it into the worldwide rankings! You are in Control BH Trials supports all kinds of inputs, from keyboard and mouse to pads (Xbox, PS2, PS3, and PS4 native), and even the Steel Battalion Controller. If you take on the challenge, we’ll make sure you do it on your own terms.",
