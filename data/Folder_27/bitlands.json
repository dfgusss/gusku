    "About the game": "Bitlands is a 2D action-adventure platformer which focuses on exploration and discovery! As a human apart of the rebel army, you must explore a war-torn world to find and overthrow the corrupt king of the Bitlands. With the help of magical allies found along the way, you might just end up saving the world! Whether you want to take your time and explore, or blast through each world, Bitlands has you covered! You can choose to play handmade levels in Story Mode, and uncover the secret backstory of the Bitlands, or play through the procedurally generated worlds in Endless Mode to complete your Critter Journal collection! Critter Journal As you play through Story Mode, you can collect and fill your Critter Journal with badges found throughout the world, and show off your completed collection to your friends! Badges reveal an enemy's weakness, while providing each enemy with a backstory. Endless Mode Endless mode allows you to play through endless, randomly-generated worlds for as long as you'd like! This means you can brush up on your skills, or unlock achievements you might have missed playing Story Mode. It also gives you new worlds to explore, each one with different obstacles and new challenges! Charity 100% of the proceeds of the revenue generated from this project will go directly to charity .
