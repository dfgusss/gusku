    "About the game": "The Bonanza Bros., Mike and Spike, are two of the most famous investigators around. One day, they received a strange phone call. “I can’t give you my name. I’ll just tell you that I’m a businessman with a problem. Many of my properties have been targets for robbery recently. I don’t know why they’ve been hit, but it’s become quite a costly situation. I need the two of you, the renowned Bonanza Brothers, to test my security forces. I have already had various items — money, papers and the like — placed randomly in ten of my establishments. Your job is to retrieve every single item. If you succeed, the reward will make Fort Knox look like pocket change. Good luck...”",
