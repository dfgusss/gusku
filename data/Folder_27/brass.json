    "About the game": "Brass is a digital adaptation of the highly acclaimed economic strategy board game set during the Industrial Revolution. Brass is a demanding game of economics, where players build monopolies in various industries during the Industrial Revolution. Brass requires concentration, intellect and ruthlessness to make your fortune. Players take on the role of entrepreneur, each with the aim of building an economic empire to surpass the other opponents. You can become a Cotton, Railroad or Coal magnate. Build. Connect. Develop. What’s your fancy? Brass is Monopoly for grown-ups. Features: - 3-4 players - AI opponent (2 levels) - Network multiplayer - Local multiplayer - In-game tutorial &amp; manual FULL DESCRIPTION It's the Dawn of the Modern World! Can you take full advantage of the Industrial Revolution and transform the Lancashire landscape? What is the best strategy? To construct cotton mills? Develop new technologies? Build canals? Produce coal or steel? There is no simple answer and the opportunities that arise will be different in each game you play as you move through the Canal and Railway eras, striving to get the best return from your investments in time to snatch the next opportunity from under the noses of your rivals. BUILD Industry is the key to success. Will you become a Cotton Magnate owning the most Cotton Mills in Lancashire? Or do you prefer selling Coal and Iron? Ports and Shipyards are key constructions as well, because no business can survive very long without them. CONNECT Build canals and later railways to connect towns and cities. Only then will you benefit from all the industries built across the country, even those built by your opponents! DEVELOP R&amp;D is essential. The better the development, the more effective your businesses will be. Should others neglect development, the easier your path to domination. TRADE It’s not what you produce, but what you sell that makes ‘brass’ (pronounced with a thick Yorkshire accent – ‘brass’ being Lancashire slang for money). Watch the markets carefully and sell at the right time! WIN Use the goods produced and activate your industries, upgrade the railways and save money. The greatest entrepreneur will be the winner.",
