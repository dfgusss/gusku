    "About the game": "FBI agent Erica Reed has an uncanny talent: she can see the past and piece together how a crime unfolded. But not even this sixth sense could save her younger brother, Scott, from a brutal serial killer. Three years later, the investigation into Scott’s murder has gone cold -- but Erica’s work has only just begun. Jump into Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller , the exciting four-part series that brings Erica face to face with the deranged demons of her past. A serial killer is loose in Boston -- one who seems to be leaving deliberate clues that only Erica, with her unique post-cognitive abilities, can uncover. Is she finally on her way to solving Scott’s murder? Or, blinded by vengeance, is she falling into a trap that could cost Erica her life? And how does this new killer know her secret? Winner of six 2013 Reader’s Choice Aggie Awards, including Game of the Year, this edition of Cognition includes everything in the original game, plus brand new director commentary for all 4 episodes and exclusive content including concept art, storyboards, outtakes and other behind-the-scenes material about the development! Developed by Phoenix Online Studios (makers of the King’s Quest spin-off The Silver Lining ), with contributions from veteran game designer Jane Jensen ( Gabriel Knight, Gray Matter ) and comic book artist Romano Molenaar ( Batman, X-Men, The Darkness ), Cognition is a thrilling adventure that grips you and won’t let go.",
