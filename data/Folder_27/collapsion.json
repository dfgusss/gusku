    "About the game": "When a black hole generates enough strength to destroy the entire universe, it's called Collapsion. It's up to you to defend the universe for as long as possible to stop Collapsion from happening. Your trusty anti-matter blaster and a slew of emergency bombs will have to do for now but several upgrades can be obtained along the way. Fight alone or have a friend join you. Battle against the destruction of the universe while competing for the highest score and accuracy before the inevitable demise of everything. ------------------ This game is not worth the full price unless you would like to support me as a developer. If you are just interested in a fun game for the money then please wait for a sale. Thank you very much if you do purchase the game!",
