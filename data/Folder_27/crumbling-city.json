    "About the game": "This is a VR physics destruction game made by a small indie team in the Unity game engine. You are a dinosaur trying to take back and restore your natural habitat that has been destroyed by humanity. Your goal is to destroy everything they have built in your former territory. With your big dino claws you can crumble huge skyscrapers within SECONDS! If that's not enough for you, we've added supernatural weapons and special abilities to make destruction way faster. Your arsenal is split up into 4 different classes based on the natural elements: EARTH - AIR - WATER - FIRE. And to make your battle even CRAZIER, there are lots of boosters, these will temporarily increase your health, speed, armor, etc.. But it's not as easy as it seems! You have to hurry and be careful because waves of enemies (with big guns) chase you around the city to prevent you from destroying their home. (If you don't own a VR headset and would still like to play this game there's also support for keyboard and mouse gaming.)",
