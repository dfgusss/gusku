    "About the game": "CubeLines is balancing act. Taking a risk and go for the big score in one go or play it safe and steady. You can choose how you play it. There are no timers, take all the time you need for your next move or swing it and see how it goes. By arranging 5 or more cubes in a line, you can clear them from the board but there is always those few that stay behind. It starts of easy; you think you have the control over the board but turn by turn it start to fill up. Go for high score for longer games or complete a few challenges for a quick game. And for those moments when you simply want to relax there is an easy mode, to simply play!",
