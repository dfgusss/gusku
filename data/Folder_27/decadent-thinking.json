    "About the game": "'Hey, what's up with you at this hour? If you're having a bad day, talk to me. If letting it out makes you feel better, I'll listen. Or would you rather I told you something...” Over 100 short stories told by a mysterious girl. A 'read' prescription for those of you who are tired of living. About the game This game aims to be a kind of 'reading' prescription for your mind! I know how easily the human heart can be broken. The way we as individuals deal with society. I think I understand, in some small way, that it has become very difficult in today's world. The pain of not being understood by others, the anxiety of society, and so on. If only I could get rid of those vague things that make my chest tighten up by reading a text or playing a game. I made it because I thought it would be nice. Also, I made it because I wrote it so well and I wanted to get paid for it (honest).",
