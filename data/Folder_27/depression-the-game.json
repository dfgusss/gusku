    "About the game": "Is an interactive game simulating major depression. You are joining a young man on one of his really bad days trying to handle his thoughts and survive that day... Will he? On average the game takes around 15 minutes to complete , but if you wish to find all the secrets it is 25 to 40 minutes This game is not for everyone A short but unique experience Have been suffering from depression for 6 years now. Developing games helps me to handle it and gives me motivation in life to keep going. Unfortunately, the topic of depression is still a taboo topic, and the affected people are having a harder time getting real help and opening up. I try to change that! I try to break the taboo with my games and take a new step in the right direction and encourage others to think about it. If you are suffering like I am please share this game with your family and friends and reach out for help. This game is based on my personal experiences. Depression is a very complex disease, therefore, there can be many differences. I am very open to feedback.",
