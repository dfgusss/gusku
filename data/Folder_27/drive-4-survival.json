    "About the game": "Drive 4 Survival is a struggle for survival mostly in the frozen wilderness, where you have to rely only on yourself and your car. The goal of Early Access is simple: Work with our community to make the best game possible. We want to hear your feedback constructively and clear, and we intend for our community to be a vital part of the development process. Your car is an integral part of surviving in the frozen wilderness. But he requires repairs and, most importantly, enough fuel. You will have to look for the last remnants of fuel in the whole world, and sometimes it will be a fight for life. But the reward will be the opportunity to enjoy the fantastic ride and get to distant locations quickly. Always a safe place to rest, and you can also store your vehicles here. The garage can be expanded to make more space available for your vehicles, and most importantly, you will also get your small car workshop for the production of new vehicles. It is necessary to obtain spare parts for the construction of vehicles. The possibility of dismantling or selling captured vehicles at the junkyard will help you with this. For better enjoyment of long journeys in the car around the frozen world, you have available a car radio with a connection to a real online music radio station. Your travels will lead mainly to locations that have succumbed to climate change and are ruled by severe winters, bad weather, and enemies who want only one thing. And that is: make your life as uncomfortable as possible. A helicopter will help you travel between the zones. You begin the game in a relatively safe zone 'The Home - Outpost 103', which will serve as your base. And from this base, you will be able to travel for knowledge and adventure or build your home here according to your ideas. This zone is one of the last not to be affected by the winter apocalypse. But there are still other locations in the world that have not succumb to climate change but are devastated and full of danger. Like an old national park with a motel. Where the game will take you for the first time during the tutorial and where you will find the necessary spare parts to repair your car. You can return to this zone at any time and perform tasks or obtain raw materials. But beware the nights are cold and dangerous here! As soon as you put your first car into operation, you will have the opportunity to travel to the main world 'The Old World'. This is a truly inhospitable world where no rules apply. In the middle of an inhospitable world, you will be mostly alone for everything - you must not trust anyone and not forget that the world around you is your greatest enemy. With minimal initial equipment, you must first solve your basic needs and a safe haven from inclement weather and an inhospitable world. Your car will help you travel faster and a little safer and explore the world. Provide him with enough fuel and embark on a dangerous journey. Currently only part of this world is available (approx. 36km2 of 144 km2). There are many mysterious nooks and places in the world to explore from the last remnants of a civilization that have not yet been covered in snow to mysterious locations. Just like in the home zone, there is an old watchtower, which will need to be found, repaired, and then will serve as a safe haven for you. Where you will be able to plan new trips or recover here after a fight or hide from bad weather. During your travels, whether you are looking for raw materials or exploring the world. You will encounter many enemies. They have their own problems and how many times will they fight among themselves or against their main enemies. Tired of waiting at the base. So build your own house according to your ideas and fantasies. And start a new home here or just a cottage in which you will warm yourself during a long journey. You can build crop fields near your house. And in peace to grow basic crops or just settle down and try to live as a farmer. Do you just want to build and not deal with survival elements? In this case, a new Creative game mode is available to you.
