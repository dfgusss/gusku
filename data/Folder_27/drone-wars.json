    "About the game": "Our goal with drone wars is it to create a fun, simple, but unique and fair multiplayer experience. What you can expect from this game: Controlling the drone is simple and easy, so no flight training needed, just jump right in and have fun! No one-shot weapons. Under normal circumstances there are no one-shot weapons, so you always have the chance to put up a fight if you get attacked from behind. The game currently supports 7 different game modes, but there will probably be more in the future. Drone: Team deathmatch Drones vs Humans: Team deathmatch Drones vs Humans: Wipeout - Survive as human until a rescue force arrives, or as a drone try to kill all the remaining humans before the timer runs out. Every dying human ends up as a drone. Drone: Arena - Last drone flying Drone: Deathmatch Drone: Capture Points - Capture and defend the capture-points Human: Team Deathmatch After each game mode, you will have the option to vote for the next game mode (can be disabled by server admins) Your feedback is important to us, so we can let the community help improve our games. We welcome you to share your thoughts with us via the steam forums or discord, and the development surveys we host.",
