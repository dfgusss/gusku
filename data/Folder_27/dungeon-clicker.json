    "About the game": "Dungeon Clicker is a resource management clicker game with a large role-playing component. You will start with one hero, the Gunner, who has unique skills and talents. As you earn gold, you will need to level up your hero to make him stronger. With each level, you will earn talent points that you can use in the skill tree to make your character even stronger. Once you reach level 10 with each hero, you will have the option to unlock the next powerful hero, who, like the previous one, has unique abilities. Each Character has a very powerful ultimate ability, which you can use as long as you have unlocked it and it is not in recovery time. When you reach the end-game of each hero, you can unlock a pet that will grant the character a special statistic, depending on what pet you choose. And it will also unlock the final passives that will lead your hero to have much more power. Resources are the essential part of Dungeon Clicker. You will have the main resource: Gold, which is used to improve your heroes and the Chamber of Gold. Gems are the most valuable resource, and trust me, you will need a lot of gems to upgrade your heroes. Scrolls, to level up drop gems and keys, that will open once the dungeon you want. More to Discover! Great soundtrack by Dark Fantasy Studio Unique 3D environments Powerful ultimate skills Tons of enemies Epic battle Bosses Pets! and many more in the future",
