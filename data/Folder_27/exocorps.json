    "Release date": "Oct 9, 2020",
    "About the game": "Part space suit, part jet fighter, and armed with the latest weaponry, the Exosuit is the pinnacle of infantry powered armor. Engage in intense aerial duels at 200 kilometers per hour, and play Deathmatch and Capture-the-Flag matches in environments inspired by locations on Earth, Moon and Mars. Drawing inspiration from books like Starship Troopers, movies like Top Gun, and games like Tribes and Counter Strike, ExoCorps is a multiplayer arena built with an emphasis on wickedly fast tactical gameplay and high-caliber weapons. CURRENT FEATURES Three Game Modes - Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag Five Battle Arenas Bot AI to play against Online play (with or without bots) Offline Play (with or without bots) Player Customization (armor skins, with many more options to come) Screenshot Mode Official Dedicated servers Player hosted servers Peer-to-Peer hosting (on most networks) LAN hosting In the year 2040, an international team has come together to create a new brand of conflict doctrine for the future. Virtual and live-fire exercises, hardware trials and tactics evaluations are held in top secret installations around the globe and beyond. As esoteric and dangerous technologies are combined by top engineering and scientific minds, applicants are recruited from peacekeeping services around the world in order to train, test and define a new paradigm of warfare. If you want to work with the best, and want to play a part in defining the future, you too can apply to be a part of the first pan-human enforcement branch; the ExoCorps. Gameplay is tuned towards a hide-and-seek experience, with intense firefights where players are countering each other by switching weapons and tactics on the fly. Your primary weapon is the Multirifle, one gun with six firing modes. In addition, your Exo-Armor can launch swarms of missiles at your enemy once you achieve lock. Use missiles to drive your opponent out of the sky. Use your Autocannon to bombard them on the ground. Use your Minigun to spray them at close range, or your Laser or Railgun to snipe them at a distance. Use your Plasma Rifle for the highest damage-per-second (if you're feeling accurate). Counter Missile Swarms by launching Flares, keep your Heat low to avoid enemy lock-on, use your Jammer to further avoid detection.",
