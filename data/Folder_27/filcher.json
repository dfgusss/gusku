    "About the game": "It's been a year since Sporey left the Blackburn Gang to make her fortune as a freelance thief. But when her former fence and mentor tracks her down, Sporey is forced back into servitude to settle an old debt. A temporary setback, she thinks. But these days, honour among thieves is wearing thin. Which of her old comrades can Sporey trust? Filcher is a first-person 2.5D noir stealth game, a lo-fi loveletter to classic immersive sims like Thief and Deus Ex. FEATURES Immersive first-person stealth: Use cover and shadows to stay unseen, tread carefully to stay unheard, and use your eyes and ears to detect enemies, loot and secrets. Explore nine lovingly hand-crafted levels, each packed with loot to steal, enemies to outsmart, security systems to bypass, documents to read and secrets to uncover. Use your tools to solve problems in creative ways. They include a trusty blackjack, a sleep-dart gun, lockpicks, flashbangs and noisemaking windup toys. An intriguing story told through snippets of dialogue, in-game readables, mission briefings and comic book-style cutscenes. A score system that rewards stealth and exploration. Replay missions in sneakier ways to earn higher ranks. The ultimate rank, 'Ghost', requires you to find all loot and secrets without knocking out any guards or being detected in any way.",
