Filled with humour, strong characters, ethical questions, poignant moments, and beautiful evocative music, Frog's Princess is a story you can play again and again.

Boys can be sensitive. Who knew? Prince Francis travels to the kingdom of Kassel with Iron Henry, the best soldier in the land. Iron Henry braves three iron bands around his heart protecting Francis from a witch. Now Francis is a frog, desperate to get a princess to kiss him so he can turn back into a prince and save Henry. Princess Emma's elder sister is clever and kind. Her second sister is brave and beautiful. They tell Emma to leave it up to them to battle the evil surrounding the kingdom, but they can't stop it. Emma dresses in her dead mother's clothes to try to use the kingdom's Golden Orb to call for help. Even if Frog gets his kiss, he and Emma will still have to rescue Iron Henry, and confront the witch of the woods. TO START When you begin, you will be asked to choose the story from the princess’s or the frog’s point of view. You can play both storylines as often as you like. Each version is saved automatically. Oh, and our programmer felt like playing one day, so he made Swimmy Frog for when you feel like a break from life for a while.",
