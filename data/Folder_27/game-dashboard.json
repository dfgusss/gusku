Privacy and Security This software doesn't require drivers or administrative privileges to work, and it doesn't write any data to the file system or Windows registry (apart from the optional user-settings file). It doesn't access the internet and can be used with Steam in offline mode. It is adequate for use in secure environments and complies with all data protection regulations, including CCPA, HIPAA, COPPA and the European GDPR. Current Limitations GUI is not available for OpenGL games (framerate control features still work). Latency control is not enabled for Vulkan games. May be enabled later, depending on player interest. GPU status and overclocking features only available for AMD and NVIDIA cards. Some status data may be missing (e.g. old graphics cards don't have a memory temperature sensor). Overclocking has some limitations described in the manual (mostly driver-related). Native UWP apps not supported (some apps in the Windows Store). Additional features are available under NDA.
