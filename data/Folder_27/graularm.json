    "About the game": "A one-room simulation &amp; dark adventure game. This room somewhere in a city have a large two-person sofa and a TV. They are free to spend their time there. You can enjoy watching their life, know their names and what kind of person they are. Come to their room and know them when you like, and enjoy. Point ・ Time will flow ・ They spend their time ・ There is a hidden 'fun' in their room Story There is a clear story in this game. As users continue to play the game, they can see the story fragments in turn. Collection Retrieved when the user sees a story fragment. I call this a badge. Users can check the conditions under which the story is published and the story text in the game from the acquired badge. Collection element. This allows the user to determine whether or not all of the story fragments have been acquired. In the future, I plan to link it with some Steam achievements.",
