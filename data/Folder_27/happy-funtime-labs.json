    "About the game": "Happy Funtime Labs is a 3D platformer and level builder online multiplayer with a stark contrast between its cute artistic style and its death animations. Build levels featuring a bunch of deadly traps and obstacles together with your friends. You are in control of adorable plushies and you can test and refine your levels as you see fit. Once finished, race against each other and see who is the fastest, the most precise and the best at avoiding the threats. Depending on the difficulty of your level, some gory deaths are bound to happen. If you want, you can upload and share your creation with the whole world. You don't want to build levels? Jump right into playing mode by choosing one of the many user created levels. Key Features Build Your Own Levels Together! Happy Funtime Labs features a simple level builder, where you can create all kinds of levels your heart desires. Easy? Check. Artistic? Check. F***ing Hard? Check. Funny? Check. Just mayhem? Check. The best part of it? You can do it together with your friends! Die In Your Own Levels! You are in control of a cute, charming plushy in a cruel, cruel world. Try to get to the end of the level first, without getting to know the insides of your favorite stuffed animal. But trust me... you will, and it will not be pretty. Share Your Levels! Share your levels with the whole world and play the ones of other players. Vote for the best levels!
