    "About the game": "********** Developer Note ********** This is my first finished project, and it took me a long time to see its value. Even for a simple and small game, a lot of work was put into it, and it still makes me proud. What you'll get here is a simple runner, only one button needed, quite good to form theories and speculations about its setting and to glimpse at my mental state at the time. Hope you enjoy =) *************************************** You are lost in a place between the living and the dead. A stranger informs you about your lack of destiny, guiding you to a way out. Collect your memories so you can escape this dark realm. - Use the keyboard keys ( Z , Space , Up ) to jump over the platforms and collect memory fragments; - Use the mouse or arrow keys to navigate the game menu, confirming with a click or pressing Z ; - Press Esc to return to te previous menu or to exit the game; - Collect enough souls to create memory glimpses and discover your forgotten past; - Don't give up. You cannot be killed permanently in this world, you can only move forward until you escape;",
