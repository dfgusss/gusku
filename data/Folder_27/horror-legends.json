    "About the game": "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Get ready for a wild night... Zombie pumpkins, punk rockers, chainsaws, and killer dolls come together in this player versus player, asymmetrical struggle for survival. Foraging and hunting down objectives or players meet frantic hack and slash combat for a tense game of cat and mouse that builds up to heart-pounding chases and brutal confrontations that support 2- 6 players! Sneak and stalk your way through distinct handcrafted locales of the Horror Legends world. Take on the role of one of the uniquely murderous and powerful Legends themselves, or a member of the diverse cast of strangers that have happened to find themselves pitted together against the supernatural killers. Includes BOT SUPPORT for both SOLO and MULTIPLAYER modes! Against all odds, survive. As a member of the cast you have one ultimate objective, survive. Will you gather up supplies and outwit the Legend long enough to escape their hunt for blood or scavenge for weapons and a means to make a stand against them? There is never only one way to win, and how you will survive is up to you. Choose from the diverse roster of cast members to escape or end the Legend’s bloodshed. Each cast member boasts unique attributes and possible loadouts. From the slippery Stevie Lint, crafty Kimmy Green, or sturdy Nick Scab, your choices in cast members have a significant impact on how best to approach the match. Become the Legend You are the Legend, you are the hunter, and you make the rules… One player each round will play as the Legend, a powerful supernatural killing machine. From sending minions to overwhelm their prey to hacking victims down with a roaring chainsaw, every Legend has completely different attributes and arsenals of abilities with which to carve through the cast. The Legend you choose has unique properties that define the nature of the entire nightmare the cast are thrust into. Some boast deep health pools spelling doom for any cast member foolish enough to fight you head-on. Others will rise from the dead eternally unless the cast fulfills objectives unique to the Legend itself. Some may even call their victims to fight by their side as one of their own. Each Legend can execute the Cast with brutal finishing moves! Set the stage for a bloody good time. Vandalized farmhouses, claustrophobic corridors of wrenched cars, and dark forests await in the array of sprawling handcrafted locales you will lurk through in Horror Legends. Each eerie location promises a distinct experience and even within the same setting, some properties and aspects of the game world will change from one round to the next, keeping the cast and the Legend on their toes. Progress and Dive in with Fate points! While playing the game you earn Fate points which can be spent to customize your cast member loadouts, unlock skins, extras, and even a 16 page comic book! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Play online for FREE with your friends in our HORROR LEGENDS DEMO . Its completely compatible with the full version of the game! You'll have access to one Cast Member (Rick Manning) and One Legend (Punkie) and you'll be able to play on all the maps for as long as you like!",
