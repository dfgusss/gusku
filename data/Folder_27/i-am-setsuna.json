    "About the game": "The I am Setsuna Collector’s Edition includes the full game and the beautiful 27 melody original soundtrack ‘Winter’s End’ by composer Tomoki Miyoshi. This is the story of Setsuna; a young woman of incredible inner strength and the sacrifice she must make to save the people of her land. The Island had a custom. To maintain peace, once a decade, a sacrifice was offered to a fiend on the island. However, one year, the fiend grew violent before the next sacrifice was due. Those living on the island were afraid and tried to calm the fiend by offering a sacrifice; Setsuna, chosen because of her powers of enchantment. Setsuna must leave with her safeguards for the farthest land, where the ceremony of sacrifice will be held. Key Features: A great homage to JRPG masterpieces of yesteryear, using the latest technology to develop a truly memorable story and player experience and bring the authentic JRPG style to current hardware. A new battle system inspired by the timeless JRPG classic, Chrono Trigger. An emotionally impactful and memorable story which immerses players in the narrative of Setsuna, whose story portrays heartrending sorrow. Beautiful character designs and varied in-game locales evoke nostalgia for classic RPGs.
