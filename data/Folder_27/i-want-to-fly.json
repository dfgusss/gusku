    "About the game": "I Want to Fly is a Visual Novel about striving to achieve your dreams despite the hardship of life. It is the story of Evie Maine, a girl who has just started at Soaring Sails University. Having taken a year off from education and coming to University halfway through the year, Evie’s top priority is making new friends and catching up with class. But after seeing a glider flying high above the university, Evie realizes that keeping up with the rest of class is the least of her priorities. Story Have you ever felt like your dream was impossible? Like that no matter what you do, it wouldn’t actually make a difference? What’s the point in trying if your dream is something you could never reach? That’s not what this story is about. Sure, it might start that way, but this is the story of how I was proved wrong. Sometimes, it’s all just in our heads. Just because we think something is impossible doesn’t mean it truly is. This is the story of a person. A person that believed their dream to be unreachable. This is the story of how they tried, one last time, to achieve their dream. Because the only real way to make your dream impossible is if you never try. This is the story of how I achieved my dream, and of the incredible people who I met on the way. My name is Evie Maine, and I Want to Fly.",
