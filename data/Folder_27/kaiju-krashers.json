    "About the game": "A giant monster with a new hobby, DESTROYING EVERYTHING! Island hopping through the Pacific to live out his destructive dream to the fullest and won't let anything get in his way. His only caveat being the limited amount of energy he has when reaching each island. Every step he takes on land causes him to lose energy in radioactive footprints. Thankfully for him, he can reabsorb that energy by moving back in place to where he was and can even move back repositioned in a different direction to get a straight shot at whatever's in his line of sight with his undefeatable Beam Blast. Swim ashore to 22 challenging levels, finding the most streamlined ways of collapsing every building on each island. Navigating your way through Hard Hitting Tanks, Turn Tracing Jet Missiles, and Tazer Death Rays to destroy them all for trying to keep you from fulfilling your passion of DESTRUCTION! UPDATE 8/18/20- A few needed fixes were implemented. -Start in fullscreen -Option to toggle Fullscreen -Volume slider reset bug Fixed -Volume slider beam blast bug Fixed -Randomly destroying buildings bug Fixed If any quality of life issues occur, please let me know at Retrobolt@hotmail.com. Thank you",
