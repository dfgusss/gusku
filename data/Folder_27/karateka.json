    "About the game": "From PRINCE OF PERSIA creator Jordan Mechner, the original side-scrolling karate classic comes to Steam with art by Jeff Matsuda (The Batman) and music by Grammy-winning composer Christopher Tin (CIVILIZATION IV). Set in a feudal universe, your mission is to rescue your beloved, Princess Mariko from the evil warlord Akuma who locked her in his castle fortress hidden in the mountain. A unique classic love story that will take you in the arcade games golden age. Karateka charms with its graphics inspired by Ukiyo-e print art, its love story and its Feudal atmosphere. Let the in-game cinematics take you right away to the Japan we've heard in history books. Be prepared for the battle. Akuma’s henchmen will do everything they can to stop you in a demanding fight to defeat. But threats can also come from the environment itself or from the air, as the warlord may decide to send his hawks on your way. Who’s going to win Mariko’s love? The fearsome Brute, the noble Monk or her brave and true love? Three endings await you with those three suitors. All of them will challenge the most advanced and skilled players to unlock more difficult achievements and endings.",
