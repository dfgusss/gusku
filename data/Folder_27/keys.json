    "About the game": "This is a story told in three parts, this is but the first act in the trilogy of a man and the threads of fate that bind him. Dim lighting, comedy, and simple puzzles add to the story's atmosphere. This game features: A spawn rate of enemies based on luck Voice acting with text as subtitles 3-5 hours of game play, variable on how many/few spawns the player gets A few easter eggs to pop culture and nerd references (see if you can find them all!) Puns and humorous banter And my playtesters found the story compelling.",
