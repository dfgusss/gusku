    "About the game": "Are you ready to put your forestry and logging skills to the test? In this simulator game, you navigate an open world, the vehicles and the trees being in accordance with real-world physics. You can interact with the terrain (altering it in the process), cruise around in the off-road automobiles, and start putting some callouses on your palms by swinging around a chainsaw, an axe, and other tools. Unlike any other simulation game, this game encourages you to master the wilderness. Each tree is like something straight out of a real-life forest, and you can cut it down however you like, paring away the branches with your hand axe and selling off the valuable logs at the local mill. How will you invest your proceeds? Machines, new land, truck upgrades: there are many options available to you. This is your business; run it how you see fit. These badass forestry vehicles feature realistic steering, suspension, gear shifts, and transmission. For truck enthusiasts, these vehicles will be familiar – the models straight out of the logging industry. You set the controls too, changing the drive mode depending on the terrain that you need to cross. Don't get stuck! The map is an open world, its details numerous and filled with challenges. From high slopes to varying surfaces, there is plenty to look out for, and you need to stay focused in order to deliver your logs to their final destination (and keep your truck intact). You choose when to enter and exit your vehicles, when you use your tools, which tools to use, and how to clear and move trees. Be careful: you are going to need a plan if you want to thrive in the logging business.",
