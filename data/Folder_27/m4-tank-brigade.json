M4 Tank Brigade is a simulation based on World War II Armored warfare. M4 Tank Brigade is not an arcade game but a simulation game that takes some real learning, great tactics, and forward thinking to play and win! The offline 'campaign' game for solo play includes various regions that gradually 'unlock' as you play. Within each region, each battle has randomly generated forces, objectives and starting positions to ensure each fight is new and different. The online game is set in a virtual battlespace where the overall tide of war ebbs and flows between two fictional nations, 'Gold' and 'Purple.' The warfare is continuous, until one side or the other conquers the dozens of objectives across the battlespace. If either side is short of players, the game 'fills in' with AI tank units to help. Even if there are no other players, the AI for each side picks objectives, attacks and defends. There is always a fight somewhere, and you as a player can make a difference in the battle.
