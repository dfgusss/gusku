    "About the game": "1826, Brazil was a paradisiacal place with natural beauties but it was also marked by injustice, violence and oppression. It's in this context that we present our two heroes: Akil, the Mandinga, a Muslim with diverse knowledge, such reading and writing and other skills, and Obadelê, Yoruba, a strong capoeirista warrior. Together they will overcome their differences and fight together for freedom! Mandinga: A tale of Banzo is a jRPG-style game, with an unique twist on its turn-based combat. Unlock different dice with special skills, assemble specialized Dicesets for different tactics and fight your way through an immersive story with a handcrafted explorable world with an unique setting. The highlight features are: Innovative dice-based combat, where every piece of gear, weapon and skills bring interesting choices. Switch between different combat styles at any turn by using the Diceset System. Story based on a troubling historical moment of Brazil that still impacts deeply its people. Play it in native Brazilian Portuguese or in English.",
