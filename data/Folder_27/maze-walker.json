    "About the game": "Maze Walker is a game for those who are already tired of simple mazes. Our maze is the right choice because it has approximately 500,000 square meters. In settings, you can turn on interesting elements that make the maze even more challenging, fun and more interesting. For example, moving walls, demons and dragons. When you turn on all the elements, the maze will become almost insurmountable. Your task is to find a golden tower. Do not be fooled by the maze and its traps.",
