    "About the game": "Welcome to the unexplored Realms of Dragoris. Part hunter, part trader, Monstermongers capture creatures and sell them to wealthy dungeon keepers to help them stock their lairs. Compete against others to recruit skilled villagers to build a team to capture them. Decide which monsters you want to sell, and which you want to tame to add to your team to help capture even bigger ones. Whoever gets the most gold wins! Inspired by engine-building Euro-style board games, at the heart of Monstermonger is strategic choice. Sell what you capture to bank your gold now, or invest to gain more gold later? It's a careful balance, but one you'll need to master. Sell too much and you won't be strong enough to capture the monsters that fetch the highest prices - sell too little and your opponent will surely beat you... Monstermonger is a strategic fantasy Digital Board Game. It plays similarly to award-winning real-life board games like 'Splendor' and 'Jaipur'. You collect resources (recruit villagers) which allow you to collect more resources (capture monsters), and build up a hand that can sell resources for victory points (gold) which determine the winner. The strategy and tactics are all in deciding which resources of what type to get, when to get them, and then deciding how and when to convert them into your winnings. As with all good strategy games, the mechanics are straightforward. Learning how to apply them to outsmart your opponent is where the enjoyment and challenge lies! Quick to learn, hard to master. Compete in a solo campaign &amp; freeplay, or local &amp; online multiplayer. Capture over 250 monsters across 8 fantasy realms Outwit varied AI with different strategies to beat. Gain ranks to become the ultimate Monstermonger!",
