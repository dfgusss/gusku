As their parent, give them the right guidance and care. Daily life interaction The game is full of realistic elements of simulated nurturing. You must balance your time and resources to provide for your child - should you play more with your child or work overtime to be able to afford better food? Taking care of your children is also one of the most important tasks of being their guardian, apart from taking care of their food, bathing, school and shopping, you also need to work, tell them stories, sew their clothes and, above all, write letters to help them find the truth and their relatives. You will find answers to the hard questions; about their history, the hatred, bullying and the passing of blame. Recreational activities Don't forget to spend time playing with your child when they are being bullied and feeling down, there are plenty of recreational activities to cheer them up again and give them the courage to interact with others. You can play ball, fish, paint, pick berries, bake and give your child a gift on a special holiday - who can resist the temptation of a gift?
