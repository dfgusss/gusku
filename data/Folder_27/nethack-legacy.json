    "Release date": "Aug 10, 2018",
    "About the game": "NETHACK: LEGACY is a remastered version of the original NetHack , the deeply rich and complex fantasy D&amp;D roguelike. Hack and slash your way through orcs, dragons, and cockatrices as you explore the perilous procedurally-generated dungeons seeking the Amulet of Yendor . About NetHack NetHack is an open source, deeply immersive roguelike that has been under development for over three decades. The work of the NetHack DevTeam and hundreds of contributors from over the years have created a deep and highly interactive world, where armor rusts from getting wet, scrolls burn from catching on fire, and bright flashes of light blind you. But the immersion goes both ways: grease your armor so the water rolls off, place your scrolls in a bag to protect them, and shield your eyes with a blindfold! The depth and complexity between game mechanics has given rise to the well-deserved credo: 'The DevTeam Thinks of Everything.' About NetHack: Legacy NetHack: Legacy is one of many variants of NetHack and is developed independently from the NetHack DevTeam. The focus of this variant is to highlight and enhance the essence of NetHack , softening the rough edges that built up over the years and enriching the overall experience. Exclusive improvements from NetHack: Legacy : Custom soundtrack uniquely composed for the dungeons of NetHack adds a powerful atmosphere to your adventures. Classic ASCII interface with beautiful retro effects lets you experience what it may have been like to play NetHack in its infancy. Improved interface and mouse support, combined with solid defaults, allows for quicker play out-of-the-box and gentler ease into the complex controls of NetHack , especially for new players. Built-in replay system lets you relive and learn from past playthroughs, allowing for realtime playback and powerful navigation. Full instruction manual expanded from the original Guidebook further expands the world and tone of NetHack (without giving away too many spoilers!). Cross-platform, Steam Cloud saves lets you seamlessly save and continue your adventure across macOS, Linux, and Windows.",
