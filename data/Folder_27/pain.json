    "About the game": "PAIN is the cutest way to suffer. Take careful aim and make sure not to rush as you attempt to fling yourself up, one consequential leap at a time. Encounter some real oddballs Meet some strange characters and make some charming new friends on your way up and learn more about them each time you fall back down. A varied journey Travel through different environments with their own unique twists on gameplay and explore every nook of the mountain to try and locate its many secrets. PAIN takes place on one large map, a fall could mean anything from dropping a couple of meters to a couple of miles. What lies at the top? There's only one way to find out... PAIN is inspired primarily by Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy and Jump King",
