    "About the game": "What happens when a conspiracy theorist, a demonologist, a psychic, an abductee, a Voodoo Queen, a paranormal investigator and a psychologist-in-training are brought together for a one-time TV show called Paranormal Teens? Not quite what you'd expect when there are dark presences at bay, and plenty of conflict to keep them... occupied. But if you mess with the supernatural, it often messes back. It's a Visual Novel that deals with all sides of the paranormal. It has over 8 endings (some romance) plus some bonus epilogues through the eyes of Zaaliah. 50k words. It's completely free to play. A STORY-DRIVEN mystery/romance.",
