    "About the game": "The objective in PATHOS is simple - deceptively so. You've got just enough moves to get to the end. No more, no less. Use every last one mindfully. Think of PATHOS as a play on the ol' sokoban style games. But instead of getting objects to their intended spot, you've got to get yourself past all those complicating obstacles, whether those obstacles are blocks, keys, teleporters, chasms or some sly board manipulation tricks. And every puzzle only gives you the moves you need - not one step extra. There's a lot to muse about regarding PATHOS. Here's what intrepid puzzlers can expect: 150+ precisely crafted puzzles that wring every drop out of the developed mechanics. No procedural tricks, no shortcuts, no nothing. PATHOS features a carefully thought out curve that is meant to gently ratchet the difficulty up, and this requires considered puzzle design and arrangement. Every single level requires a novel slice of perception, attention, logic or working memory. There are no wasted moments in PATHOS. Mysterious narrative that challenges and provokes. Ego's job, to the extent that a psychological aspect can have a job, is summoning and rallying his fellow aspects. Together, they forge through the crests and troughs that life delivers. Managing emotions, meeting obstacles, maintaining an uneasy homeostasis - that is Ego's burden. But, what happens when the burden becomes too much? 41 achievements, most discovered through deciphering verbal and visual clues. Pictograms and riddles - you're going to need a pencil and paper, or an illuminated mind, to defeat most of these. Secrets woven even deeper into PATHOS’ fabric. Yes, if you want to 100 percent PATHOS, you'll need to play super sleuth. It may take weeks, months - it might take years to piece it all together, but there's something waiting at the finish line for the admirably zealous. Powerful OST by Tim Halbert, with a definite earworm or two in there. Halbert's a groove guru, and PATHOS' OST is something you can clean a house, paint a masterpiece or dance with your dog to. It also helps shake loose that latent mental acuity.",
