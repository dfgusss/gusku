    "About the game": "Upgrade your peasants with devastating weaponry in an attempt to hold back the Viking onslaught. Gameplay Gold is acquired at the completion of each round and can be used to purchase weapon cards at the shop. Peasants can be upgraded by dragging these weapons onto them. Weapon cards can be upgraded at the forge as long as you meet the requirements. The forge can be progressed through multiple tiers, unlocking deadlier weaponry at every turn. Win by completing every wave, earning stars which allow you to unlock more maps. Builds There are a countless number of ways to build your defences. Most tower abilities stack with each other so you may want to build many of the same tower, however doing so will be costly and may leave gaps in your strategy. The weapon cards sold at the shop are randomised but can be refreshed at a cost. As a result, it is possible to build the same way every game, but it will often be very expensive to do so. To play efficiently, adaptation is necessary.",
