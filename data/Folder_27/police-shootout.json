    "About the game": "/ / Police Shootout is a turn-based FPS game. Start your policeman’s career, solve cases, gain experience, and begin your adventure in San Adrino now! WELCOME TO SAN ADRINO Your name is Scott Price and you just started your first shift as police officer in a small city of San Adrino. You moved here from a bigger place where street gang fights are everyday life. SO LET ME ASK YOU... Why did a policeman like you – the one who was doing well in a big city suddenly wants to take a chance in a place like this? What are you looking for here? What is your reason? Or maybe… What is your secret? LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GAME... Start your adventure with 'Police: Shootout' and meet not only the main character (Scott Price), but also everyone who is important to his story. As a good policeman, you will answer even the most difficult calls. A shop robbery, or even a hostage situation - you have to be prepared for anything! But remember – it’s only up to you how you approach a specific situation. WHAT KIND OF COP YOU WILL BE? WHAT IS YOUR STYLE OF SOLVING THE CASES? There are many possibilities to do this right - sometimes the use of a gun is necessary, and sometimes a well-chosen argument is the best possible weapon. Each of these situations brings you closer to finding what you’re looking for... And of course to be a better cop! The correct approach to the calls will allow you to expand your experience - the higher it is, the more benefits you’ll get. Your skills will grow the way you want, and this will allow you to complete new missions faster and more efficiently. LET'S GET TO WORK! Are you ready to step in and get it right? Don't wait any longer, the first call is waiting for you! Just play the game and see for yourself!",
