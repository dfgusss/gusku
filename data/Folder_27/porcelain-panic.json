    "About the game": "3 Game Modes! Story Mode - A short but also desperately lacking story where the object is to rescue Princess Bog from the Bog-Lord. Turdurance Mode - How long can you hold it in with increasingly hard to find bogs ? Tribog Mode - Become a Bog-Lord! They need to use the bog too. Match your ever changing character to their rightful bog. 5 Unlockable Characters! Each with their own not so impressive stats such as speed 1, speed 2 and speed 3! 6 Unlockable Items! Discover wondrous items such as the Bog Cleaner, it will give your bog a healthy shine and sparkle that all good bogs deserve! Or the mighty X-Ray Specs that allow you to peep right through bog doors! Other Features Two shades of brown. A Bog-Prince and a Bog-Lord (but not at the same time). An annoyingly addictive sound track. One shade of brown is rather sickly. Impressive buzz words such as 'Golden Wipe' and 'Spice Turd'.",
