The Story The game takes place many billions of years ago in the center of the universe, the first planet that all other planets were seeded from. Due to it's unusual rotation, one side of the planet is always in darkness and the other always in light. ​ Every few thousand years a small moon passes between the planet and sun to create a long lasting eclipse that allows the beings from the dark side to travel among the light. The current time period is during this eclipse. You play as Grygor, a being form the dark side (or so you believe) sent on a mission to destroy temples of light and allow safe passage for your people during the eclipse. ​ Uncover the story of both sides of the world, it's many generations of tribal law and unforgiving landscape during this opportune moment in time. You are the future of our past. You are the Shadow within the Shadow.",
