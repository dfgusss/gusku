    "About the game": "PSYCRON is a 2D action Metroidvania where you try and escape the deep space scientific research vessel CEREMOS. Explore four wildly different areas as you fight strange enemies, acquire upgrades which change how you traverse the station and discover what happened to the crew of the CEREMOS as you try to escape. Run, jump and shoot your way through CEREMOS. Many parts of the station are inaccessible until the right ability or weapon is found; thorough exploration of the station’s four areas is essential to escape! Every upgrade changes how you tackle both combat and exploration. Dynamic bosses will test both your platforming and aiming skills as you make your way through the station. Venture across four distinct areas to find a way out. PSYCRON features a soundtrack that draws inspiration from classic Metroidvanias while combining elements of Jazz and Acid to create a score which is both atmospheric and memorable.",
