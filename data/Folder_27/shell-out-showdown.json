    "About the game": "A food-fight where everybody stays in the game until one player gives out all their items and remains empty handed to win! Choose your anthropomorphic vending machine and get to food tossin'! Hectic and simple platforming gameplay. Dodge food and throw food! Customize your character with different colors, effects, trails and even buddies! 90's Inspired pixel art and FM-Synth-heavy, Jazzy music Levels in various locations such as a mall, the French Quarter, a junkyard, a tall radio tower and more! Create and join lobbies for you and your friends to play online! Play locally with up to 4 players. Makes for a great party game! Humanity is gone, all that remains is the tech they left behind. Learn from their mistakes, be generous and care about others! Transcend humanity with the gift of generosity! ^~^ Shell Out Showdown is part of what has retroactively been termed the 'molasses jam' run by the Bay Area Dev Collective . The theme of the jam was to make a violent genre non-violent . I picked the last-person-standing battle-royale genre, as it tends to be dominated by violent games, and Shell Out Showdown eventually came to life! These other molasses game jam games are also on Steam: / / /",
