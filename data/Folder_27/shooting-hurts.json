    "Release date": "Sep 18, 2018",
    "About the game": "Assume the role of a newly generated AI known as C.R.E-3d who was created for one purpose: to test an experimental energy weapon known as the Energy Projectile Converter. The E.P.C. is a special weapon that is able to turn your health into projectiles, as well as generate solid platforms. Using these two functions, you will run, jump, and at times even shoot your way through numerous chambers packed with enemies designed to test your ability. How will you overcome them all and face the final challenge, when your own weapon is damaging to use? How will you make every shot count, when shooting hurts? This game is 100% free, and features no In-Game purchases or microtransactions",
