    "About the game": "TRY IT NOW FOR FREE! / Join the three skelebros -Lefti, Midi, and Righti- on a grand road trip through the cutesy world of the dead. After realizing they wasted their lives watching horror movies, they decide to embark on a big adventure. Spanning across 4 episodes released separately, each containing 3 chapters with their own area, microgames, mechanics, and story! Meet all sorts of boney folk and get into heaps of trouble. Before you know it, you'll be well on your way to solving a murder mystery on a cruise ship or starting a high school band to skip out on class. Challenge yourself with a wide collection of blazing-fast microgames themed around horror tropes. Featuring over a hundred microgames you're sure to get shaken to your bones! Each game takes only a few seconds, so you'll have to use your wits to survive the onslaught of wildly different blood-curling games. From frantically decapitating some poor guy's head to filing your taxes, the horror never ends! The very first episode of SPOOKWARE features 60+ microgames scattered over 3 chapters and a prologue . Each chapter features new mechanics, its own story, and an area to explore littered with skele-folk to throw awful jokes at. Episode 1 has an estimated playtime of 5 to 6 hours . If you're feeling up to the challenge, try and beat every microgame at least once to add them to your collection. You can even remix them together in an ultimate endless mode that just keeps getting faster! Spooky! Each microgame is carefully interwoven within the story. Each area features completely new gameplay mechanics to test your microgame skills. Even going as far as changing up control schemes! One moment you'll be puzzling away at brain-teasing microgames with your mouse, another you'll be mashing your keys to the beat of rhythm-based microgames. Don't worry, the game has full controller support as well. Features to Expect from All 4 Episodes: 200+ hand-crafted, blood-pumping, horror-inspired microgames. 4 episodes featuring over a dozen beautiful areas to explore in the land of the dead. Play as 3 adorable skeleton brothers Lefti, Midi, and Righti. Unique mechanics for every area, from rhythm to puzzle games. Remix all your unlocked microgames for the ultimate challenge.
