When the aliens swarm your maze and everything seems lost, use active abilities like Air Strike and Freeze to tilt the battlefield to your advantage! Strategy and skill are leading principles of Super Sanctum TD. Carefully choose your loadout of towers and active abilities before each level to make sure you can handle everything that will be thrown at you. Each battle is rewarded depending on your performance, and you can use these rewards to gain access to Perks that let you tweak and specialize your strategies even more! Carefully plan your maze to master the game on all difficulties. Towers like Gatling, Flamer and the Automatic Crowd Pummeler, all with their own individual strengths. Intercept enemies from reaching the Cores with active abilities like Smart Bomb and Gravity Shift! Vast perk system that lets you specialize specific towers, abilities, and more! Prove yourself as the ultimate Core defender by defeating the game on all difficulties and game modes. Square up against the best for a spot on the leaderboard by putting your deadliest strategies to the test in Survival Mode!
