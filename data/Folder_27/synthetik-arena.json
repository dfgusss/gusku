Only you can battle through the levels of Kaida Corporation's Headquarters, defeat the battalions of enemies within and put an end to this madness. The defeat of the Machine Legions 'Last Defender' has thrown you into your Android-subconscious and the only way out is to face the challenges of the machine god Zir. Will you be able to stand your ground?",
