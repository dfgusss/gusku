    "About the game": "'All seek inner peace out of life, though the path and what exactly that peace details is something only we can decide for ourselves. Regardless if this be of the Divine or otherwise, all life strives towards an end that those who live might deem significant.' ~ Vrenmasil The great hunger of the Abyss has finally been sated, but still not all is well. What To Expect: Strategic Combat: No matter your play style, all measures of overcoming your foes have been improved to their fullest - making all choices not just effective but engaging, too! Every elemental class comes tied with its own statuses that shape the flow of battle, and to go with this magical system are equally robust melee specializations. Each weapon has specific abilities inherent to their class, and with every character capable of dual wielding, the customization possibilities are vast. Even shields can be dual wielded as weapons for those who prefer a 'tanking' class! Characterization Aplenty: To go with all the ways to explore and master the world of Eylin is a cast of protagonists and antagonists with their own motivations that develop throughout the game. From the very beginning, you're introduced to those who dream of a new life. As your understanding of each character expands, so does their relations to each other. By the end of the Tale, no one is as they started - all organically affected by the wages of everyday life. Riches Abound: Hidden throughout the world are many treasures, and some require great effort to obtain. Not only will you encounter many traditional treasure chests, but exploration of the countryside will yield fruits from a gladiatorial arena, a shady treasure collector and his riddling runes, a guild of fisherman and the hidden wealth of those who have separated themselves from a world of endless war. Those who go the extra mile to explore will even discover special Mementos that open the door to six fully interactive campaigns by means of the Book of Zilmurik that further flesh out the history of Eylin. Wherever you go, there is always something to be found - even beyond the reaches of mortality.
