    "About the game": "'A lump of meat' that was born somewhere sometime. 'He' had both consciousness and wisdom. And he realized that there was something 'to do'. You become the lump of meat, a 'chimera' and explore the forgotten old church in the mountains. With the help of the mysterious 'them', you will know the meaning of your 'birth'. Collect items and strengthen yourself while exploring. After execute 'some event', the 'generation' changes and you transform into another chimera. It is also possible to increase the number of party members by 'Split'. The battle is an auto battle, but processing such as 'formation', 'organization', and 'equipment change' are executable. The higher the 'intelligence', the more rational the player chimera's actions. The explanation page will open with the 'Item Details' button on the status screen. Details of each item are described on this page. 'Difficulty' cannot be changed during the game. All other items (language, battle speed, etc.) can be changed.",
