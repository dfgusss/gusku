    "About the game": "Mirenia is an 18 year old girl on a quest for redemption. After unleashing an evil power when she was a teenager, she is now on her way to Tirkin Fortress to perform an ancient spell that should help her vanquish the very evil she unleashed three years ago. Now, nearing the end of her quest, she arrives in the villages just outside the fortress, where monsters ravage, young women are being raped and men are being slaughtered. Armed with her trusted Shield Blade, Mirenia is so close of undoing the mistakes of her past. Will she succeed or ultimately only make matters worse? The Skylia Prophecy is a sidescrolling action-rpg platformer set in a medieval fantasy world, based on the great Arcade hits of the past. As Mirenia, you will journey throughout the lands and towns, explore ancient dungeons and battle hordes of the undead in this hard as hell adventure inspired by the 'kill the player' philosophy of the 'Souls' games. Along your way you will meet the people of these lands, who will ask you to help them, sell you powerful items and reveal secrets to aid you on your journey. Not a traditional metroidvania game, but with elements of the genre, the scaled back combat rewards patience - the game is not unfair, but you have to pay attention! By interacting with the townsfolk, you will ultimately recieve rewards that make the game easier in the long run - thus, you set the difficulty for the final strech yourself! Will you find redemption or ultimately end up among the dead? The Skylia Prophecy will challenge you on every turn with its hard but fair difficulty, powerful bosses and exploration-based riddles. -------------------------- Features Upgrade Mirenia with a level and magic system Over a dozen different locations Beautiful pixel-art Story-driven exploration Tough-as-nails difficulty Atmospheric Music Challenging and complex boss battles Please read the instruction manual if you require assistance.",
