    "About the game": "Welcome to the underwater world of Atlantis. Atlantis, a likely mythical island nation mentioned in Plato’s dialogues “Timaeus” and “Critias,” has been an object of fascination among western philosophers and historians for nearly 2,400 years. Plato (c.424–328 B.C.) describes it as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank, in a night and a day, into the ocean around 9,600 B.C. The ancient Greeks were divided as to whether Plato’s story was to be taken as history or mere metaphor. Since the 19th century there has been renewed interest in linking Plato’s Atlantis to historical locations, most commonly the Greek island of Santorini, which was destroyed by a volcanic eruption around 1,600 B.C. At the beginning of the game there is a map which you can choose your destinations. You can explore freely under the sea. There are all kinds of corals, schools of fish, and of course whales and sharks. Each scene has a magical undersea stone gate, need to find it to enter the next world. In the last part there is a treasure chest, find it! Guess what you can get! Through the map next to it, enter the seabed and trigger it directly from the lower right corner. Use your VR device to launch a ray to operate. Every level has a stone gate to enter the next world. It takes you a while to find has a stone gate to enter the next world. It takes you a while to find",
