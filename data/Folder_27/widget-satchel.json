    "About the game": "You are Sprocket , an adorable ferret on a remote space station. Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the most stuff! Widget Satchel is a thrilling adventure for one little thief, with fiendish puzzles, joyous platforming, and dozens of hidden collectables. As you stumble deeper though the station evading your human caretakers, you steal things like widgets and socks. And you stash them, because you’re a ferret. But don't worry: You may lose some widgets (or your socks!), but Sprocket can't get hurt and there is no 'game over.' And nothing is blocking your path to the shuttlebay, so the game is only as challenging as you want it to be. It's up to you: race though the station at top speed, or meander around knocking over piles of junk and hitting bots with your wrench. Or… gather up all your ferret-y determination to stash away each widget, discover every trinket, and try on all 30 pairs of socks! Widgets : you want them! But every widget you collect adds to the weight of your satchel, making it a little harder to reach the next platform or avoid the station’s maintenance bots. Levels can be relatively easy if you don't collect any Widgets, but they become a greater challenge as you fill Sprocket’s satchel. Stash enough widgets, and you can use them to fabricate doohickeys , which help you unlock new paths and previously out of reach areas. It’s a ferretroidvania! Bots giving you trouble? Equip yourself with The Wrench and show them what's what. Widget out of reach? Put on Jef's Boots and get up there! There are five Doohickeys to help you on your adventure, and you can build them in any order, so you can play the game (and discover its secrets) however you like. High scores, hidden collectables, and secret paths are great, sure, but in Widget Satchel you can also just knock stuff over and get into trouble if you prefer! And the more mischief you do, the more mischief points you'll earn! What are mischief points? It's not important, but there are an awful lot of them! Even after you finish the game, the adventure isn't over. Escape your playpen again (and again) to pursue different challenges. Ferret out all those hard-to-reach areas for a higher widget count, knock around more junk for a greater mischief score, or zoom through the station for a faster finish time. The more you play, the more of the game's 20+ Steam Achievements (aka 'Feats') you'll accomplish, and the more you’ll discover about the station, its human crew, and the Expedition they’re a part of. Just remember: Commander Key misses you, and is waiting patiently for you to return to her… Original soundtrack that dynamically reacts to your progress. Replayable areas with 'metroidvania-lite' pathing. Sock-exclusive inventory system. Trapdoors, lifts, hydraulic pillars, and other nonsense machinery to manipulate. Human characters to mildly inconvenience! Piles and piles of junk! ...and more!",
