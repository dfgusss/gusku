    "About the game": "3Buttons is a short free-to-play platformer where you will only need three buttons to play! Choose between three different geometrical shapes; Sphere, Capsule, and the dreaded Cube. There are three different campaigns, in each you can submit your High Score for the global leaderboards! Good luck. --------------------------------------------------------------------- To report bugs or to contact the developer, visit ' '. --------------------------------------------------------------------- Shapes : Choose between three different geometrical shapes, each with its own difficulty level: Sphere - The easiest way to play. Small and perfectly symmetrical. Capsule - Slightly harder than the Sphere as it has a 'wobbly' effect. Cube - Practically impossible after Level1. Only exists for the real try-hards out there. Game Modes : Choose between three different game modes: Normal - When you die you will respawn at the start of the level. Speedrunner - No respawn. However, if you beat the game your result will be added to the High Scores. Sanbdbox - A Scene Selector where you can play specific levels again. Other Features : Bindings - Allows the user to customize its input keybindings. Cutscenes - Before each level there is a short cutscene highlighting the the architecture of the level. Original Music - All of the music was composed directly for this game. Native FPS-Counter - Press 'T' to toggle the native fps-counter. Graphic Settings - There are three different graphic settings: LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH. Resolution/Framerate Ambivalence - The game should work on all resolutions and framerates. The game will forever be completely free-to-play. --------------------------------------------------------------------- KNOWN ISSUES * The cutscenes seem to not play properly on Linux devices. --------------------------------------------------------------------- About the game as a project My name is John 'Flex' Segerstedt, currently a software engineering student studying at CTH, and this game was designed and developed by me during the summer of 2018 using Unity. I hope you enjoy the game, as I enjoyed making it, and if there is some glaring bug that is a must-fix then don't be afraid to report them on ' '.",
