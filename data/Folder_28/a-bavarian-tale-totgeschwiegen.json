    "About the game": "“Totgeschwiegen - Chapter I” (“deathly hush”) is a third-person RPG detective story, set in rural Bavaria in 1866. As the young Medical student Valentin Schmidt you will travel to Wolpertshofen in order to write a report of the peoples’ living situation for the King, when a sudden death causes turmoil in the small Bavarian village. The demo and the full release have complete english text and voiceover! Right before your eyes, the picturesque, pastoral village turns into a world full of dark secrets, inexplicable events, social tensions and a hostile hush of a village that seems to hate nothing more than a stranger poking around in other peoples’ business. Can you find out who supports you and who is trying to set you on the wrong track without risking your own life? - Lead intriguing conversations: use the dialogue-mechanic to collect information, find out who is hiding something from you and convince the villagers to help you out. - Make difficult decisions: your decisions have an impact on the course of the story, the world and the villagers. Not every consequence is visible right away, though. - Defend yourself: if your sneak-mission has failed, you can use the fight-mechanic as a last resort and defend yourself with an old fashioned fist fight. - Find hidden clues: use the detective-mechanic to find clues and evidence. - Move around in the shadows unnoticed: the stealth-mechanic is how you can sneak past enemies and guards or distract them by aiming and throwing stones. - Develop your character: take it step by step and develop your character with every new level using the skill-mechanic. Decide how you want to solve the tasks at hand. With charisma, diplomacy, the art of stealth or strategic escape? The mission, however, is clear: solve this case! Totgeschwiegen Chapter I will be releases in german language only on the beginning of early access. But we are working on a english translation that will be available soon. Check our roadmap for more information!",
