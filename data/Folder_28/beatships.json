    "About the game": "Cruise through the beat of each song while destroying enemy ships. BeatShips is a rhythm based shoot 'em up in which your ship shoots to the beat of the song. Earn maximum score by destroying all enemies and trying not to let them pass you by, but be careful, since some are tough to defeat or have special abilities that can harm you from afar. Play the official levels or load your favourite songs into the level editor to create your own. You can even decide what types of caves and particles will be used to set the mood of the level. Join the community and share your levels, or try some that others have made. Create your own levels using the built-in Level Editor.
