    "Name": "燃爆英雄(Bomb Hero)",
    "Release date": "Feb 22, 2022",
    "About the game": "Is this a three elimination game? Is this a multiplayer game? NO！ This is the most difficult game in history!!! The difficulty of getting started is Epic!!! Enter the game and send only one hero Only one hero? NO！ There are many heroes!!! You may not know the hero who can switch on the hero interface! Entering the battle, you may think you can only turn the box and walk around, I'm even racking my brains to figure out what you're going to do, How to turn the box around and what tricks can be turned out NO！ You don't need to study!!! You just need to run around!!! Then you find that you accidentally ignited a few squares. Oh, so this is an elimination game! NO！ This is not an elimination game!!! This is a war game!!! At this time, you find one or three guys with red blood on their heads running around opposite, And it's unrestricted running all over the map. Are you ignorant? Is the battle just running around and running around? YES！ Because there is an enemy, isn't a multiplayer game? Did you find that the color of the lit box opposite is completely different from the one you lit? By the way, the box you lit is yellow, and the box lit by the other party is red Then you stand on each other's box curiously, Bang, you're blown up!!! Yes, the box you light won't kill yourself, but the box lit by the other party will kill you! If you are sprayed by the flame of box explosion, you will also be sprayed to death! You run around and hide from each other's exploding squares. Never step on them or be sprayed by flames, Then you work hard to light a pile of connected squares and wait for them to explode, Poof, the other party turns over the same box, and all the boxs turn red!!! They're grabbing your diamonds!!!!! You learned to grab each other's diamonds, Then the box exploded, gained experience and soon rose to level 3, You can decide whether to upgrade each of the three skills by one level or how to add points. It's up to you What, skills? Why are there skills? You try to throw a skill out,, WTF！ The original skill can also lit the box! Oh, there are three skills. You tried to order the other two skills WTF, how come the other two skills are thrown out and the box doesn't respond at all? You lost the wrong object. You should lose it to the enemy hero! When the opponent's hero is standing on the square lit by you, or very close, you can use the control skill to control the opponent, and then wait for the square to explode Bang, you blew up the enemy! Ha ha, do you already know that this is a war game at this time? Does it smell inside? YES！ This is an extremely fierce game [/] We have designed many heroes and skills (although only 6 are released now) Each hero has different characteristics, Some are good at lighting blocks Some are good at killing enemies Some are good at assisting teammates ，，，， Heroes can fight alone, but they pay more attention to mutual cooperation, For example: -The master, Pascal, 1 skill and 3 skill moves are all ignited. After the big move is full, it can even reach an amazing range of 5 * 5, which is more suitable to ignite dice than other heroes. Moreover, these two heroes have thick blood and can be used as defensive heroes to ignite dice and recharge at the charging point -Vulcan's young son and mechanical puppet, these two heroes don't have large-scale ignition skills, and the most important thing is to have detonation skills. You know, the killing method of this game is to generate damage by explosion, which is very direct. They can be killed by instant detonation. The positioning of these two heroes is very clear, that is to do the work of assassins. In addition, the big move of Vulcan's young son is the fire wheel, It can directly and instantly detonate unlit dice. It can be said to be a big killer,,, -Cannibal flower and bear mushroom fairy, these two heroes are basically control skills. Cannibal flower has two dizzy skills. If CD is fast enough, it can dizzy the enemy to death. The disadvantage of this hero is that it is not aggressive and ignitable enough, so it can only do some auxiliary work; Immortal bear mainly relies on skill 1 to flash. The other two skills are relatively useless. The skill level is raised to level 4. He constantly flashes around the whole map and brings dizziness. Gank finally flips dice to light a pile and snatches it as soon as he flashes. He also stuns himself. He can't move. You really wants to strangle it,,, How difficult it is to start, how fun it is. Look forward to your discovery! ========================================== Bomb hero [QQ group of fans]: 185274759 [latest announcement] explosive hero is tentatively scheduled to launch the first experience version on February 22, 2022.
