    "About the game": "Everything can be modded in this city sandbox with jobs, NPCs, apartments, garages, gangs, and more. Broke Protocol is an open-world action game like GTA but with a strong focus on city roleplaying and custom content. You set your own goal and identity in fully scriptable community-run servers. Currently in Early Access . Roleplay in limitless ways to gain money, power, and influence in dynamic city environments. Start with nothing and build your wealth, while managing your hunger, thirst, stamina, and addiction levels. Find amazing custom content, hand-made for each server. From exotic cars and weapons, to cool scripts and custom maps. Or start your own community with unique assets and scripting. Steal cars, process drugs, trade with citizens, heal the injured, or enforce the law. Anything goes and the ways you can play are endless. Be warned, every player has a criminal record - and crimes like Grand Theft Auto, or Armed Assault will surely land your character in prison.
