    "About the game": "Captures is a chess-driven puzzle game. The objective is to capture the opponent's pieces. While the chess pieces move according to the regular rules, the board itself varies from level to level. Boards from 3x3 to 8x8 are present in the game. Also certain squares on the board might have 'tile effects'. When you capture a piece on a cursed square, you lose your piece as well. Pieces that land on a poisoned square will expire in 3 turns. Pieces placed on the portal move to the other portal after black completes its turn. Pieces that land on a tile with the random effect will transmute into another piece. The levels are mostly beginner friendly. People who are looking for a challenge can attempt a built-in speedrun. In speedrun mod levels start one after another, and the player has to make fewer than 5 mistakes through out the whole run. CONTROLS -Drag &amp; drop pieces. -Click the restart button or press R key to restart the levels. RULES -All black pieces must be removed from the board to win the level. -If a stalemate occurs, the level fails. -If white loses all of their pieces the level fails. However, if white loses their last piece at the same time with the black, the level is completed. -During a speed run, reseting a level counts as a mistake. TIPS -Random tips will be shown through out the game. -CPU likes to trade pieces, take advantage of it!",
