    "About the game": "(Note: This game is a direct continuation of the story of Crimson Gray .) Lizzie has it all: a loving boyfriend, a beautiful collection of knives, and an intense desire to murder. She's escaped the conspiracy that forced her to kill in self-defense, but now she needs to adjust to normal college life. All Lizzie wants is to act like a normal couple, graduate from university, and get married. But a committed relationship isn't enough to stabilize her, and she finds herself spending a lot of time with her knives. This visual novels plunges you into the mind of a deeply unstable young woman, viewed entirely from her skewed perspective. Your task is to find a way for her to be a normal student, a supportive partner, and not a serial killer. This is a short visual novel with an emphasis on unreliable narration and subtle consequences of the player's actions.",
