    "About the game": "Critter Clicker is a casual farming simulator with unique, flexible gameplay. It has a free, built-in autoclicker. (We don't like wrist pain either.) Gather resources, upgrade critters and buildings, sell your farm when you want a bigger one and never stop expanding. Build mills to make bread to make gold. Build tracks for horses and speed up your farm work. Build smithies to increase production. And, when you're ready, upgrade your farmhouse and take your farm to the next level.",
