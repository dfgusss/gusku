    "About the game": "Dear Devere is a visual novel told through letters. 'I suppose I should start with a short summary of my life. I don't really feel like doing that, so I shall skip to the present.' The year is 1935. It all started with a single letter. But from that point on, nothing would remain the same for Angela Bard--a quiet, solitary woman living in the Scottish isles. Much to her surprise, she receives a mysterious and strangely esoteric reply from an unexpected source... Who is Devere? And how can he be sending letters from the forest at the edge of Angela's town? Read through their illustrated correspondence, and watch their story unfold. Features Voice acting for the leads. Examine an array of letters, postcards, and other documents. Multiple endings. Open Dyslexic font option. Self-voicing and descriptive text toggle. Text-to-speech voice mode. Includes a Simplified Chinese translation. Team Katy133 ....... Writer, Artist, Programmer Chintarmanya Vivian ......... Voice of Angela Mike Young ......... Voice of Devere Paul Robins .........
