    "About the game": "'Don't Feed' is inspired by popular 'Warcraft3' custom games like 'Footman Frenzy' and 'Pimp My Peon'. Four players fight to the death by commanding armies of upgradable units! I have plans to make this a competitive multiplayer game if it receives a positive response from the community. Let me know what you think by posting on the discussion boards! 'Don't Feed' uses an isometric 2D art style, which helps to maximize the number of units that can be on the battlefield. There are no heroes, because I feel that controlling a hero warrants its own game (e.g. 'DOTA'). This game instead focuses on the RTS play style.",
