    "About the game": "Draw &amp; Guess is a casual and creative drawing game for 2-16 people (or 4-16, depending on the game mode)! Each player receives a word and draws it without using characters or numbers. The next player guesses the word behind the drawing. Then another one draws it again! The cycle continues and if the first word is correctly guessed by the last player, that's a trophy! After three rounds, the player with the most trophies wins! .. but that really isn't the greatest fun of the game as you will soon notice, with your carefully crafted drawings being completely misinterpreted ;-) Draw and Guess is currently available in multiple languages with hundreds of family-friendly words to draw per language! It is also very useful to practice vocabulary of new languages. Customize your game: * Play the classic way with one color, or use multiple colors! * Activate the Speed Mode for an additional challenge! * Want more drawing mayhem? In Invisible Mode, you have to draw while your strokes turn invisible! New Game Mode supporting 2-16 players! Choose a word and draw it while everyone else tries to guess as fast as they can!
