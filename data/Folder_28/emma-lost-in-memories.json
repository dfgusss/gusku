    "About the game": "Poetic, surrealistic and melancholic, EMMA: Lost in Memories offers a unique experience in a strange and dangerous world where walls fade away as you touch them. The main character, Emma, is young, vibrant and intriguing: she leaves her home following an owl, and soon loses herself in a world which she slowly finds more and more dangerous. Features : One fast and simple mechanic: all the platforms and walls start disappearing when you touch them! The character runs automatically at a fixed speed! Control her special abilities (double jump, dash and climb) and do your best to react at the correct time. Minimalistic 2D artistic style completely drawn by hand. Dynamic gameplay in a poetic and eccentric world. Single-screen levels which combine skill and ingenuity with planification and strategy. Two game modes: Main Story and Memory Chest. Complete the Main Story first to enjoy the levels in the Memory Chest! Delicate reflexion on memory loss.",
