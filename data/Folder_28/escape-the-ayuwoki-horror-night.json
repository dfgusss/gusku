Play as the Ayuwoki or a survivor in the Asymmetric version, or get chased by an AI creature on the new Coop vs AI Mode. Play alongside your friends and don't let the creature catch them! Get rewarded by helping your teammates, solving puzzles and working as a team. Choose your favorite skin, improve your skills by eating rats and crouch for better speed to catch all survivors in the Asymmetric Version of Horror Night. Hunt down every single one of them to become winner! Escape through different exit points by solving randomized puzzles in the mansion. [Not all clues will lead to something] Team work is essential! As a Survivor: Customize your character by choosing from a variety of hairstyles, outfits, accesories, lamps and much more! As the Creature: Select the most scarier skin to hunt all players down! [New items will only be unlocked by levelling up]",
