    "About the game": "Exosphere is a short but challenging indie game. My take on the punishing climbing game genre. You aim, shoot &amp; bounce your way into the outer layer of the atmosphere using just your mouse. Can you make it to the top? The game uses two different views. The eagle-view &amp; the side view. The eagle view is used for observing &amp; navigating through the environment. The side views are primarily used for shooting the ball. Use the mouse to aim &amp; shoot towards your destination. Visit the yellow tiles to save your progress (until you exit the game). If this is your first time playing, watching the tutorial video on the main menu is highly recommended. Music by Avaren.",
