    "About the game": "FoxTail is a classic point-and-click quest. Drawing inspiration from the old pixel adventure games of the middle 90's, we create an atmospheric and spectacular world without using sophisticated modern technologies. FoxTail is about a cute, young fox named Leah who goes on a journey to find a cure for her grandmother. Along her life changing trip she explores forests, swamps and caves, gets acquainted with various creatures and helps them in their needs. She also reveals the secrets of her grandfather's mystical past... Complex and variable tasks: the world of FoxTail triggers player’s imagination and gives an opportunity to solve problems in different, but equal in complexity ways. A charming story: echoing the leisurely rhythm of the old school adventures, the story is still colorful and impressive, but never boring. Characters and their stories: every character in the game has his own life, in which the player will have to take part, one way or another. The main heroine, Leah the fox, is charismatic, funny and cunning, as any fox is supposed to be. She will have a long and difficult journey: through the labyrinths of mines, mountains, swamps and dangerous forest at night, defeating her own fears and helping those who meet her on the way. All this is for the great positive goal that doesn’t allow her to retreat or surrender.",
