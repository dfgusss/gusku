    "About the game": "9.23 The playing card editing function has been repaired, which has affected the game experience of some players. I apologize again! The screen resolution is highly recommended to be set to 1344 or higher. We will continue to optimize the display issues to bring you a better gaming experience. How the came about The original intention of was to make a multi-hero battle game. Each hero should have its own special skills. The operation should be simple. The game itself should not be very complicated, but we hope that the gameplay will be full of changes. Therefore, the following rules have been determined: 1, the game scene is limited within one screen, and it is not tiring to play, preferably a single-digit grid scene. 2, since there are many heroes to fight against, if it is made into RTS, it will be very busy to command. If you don’t command, you can only let them fight automatically according to the AI rules, which is more suitable for making a card game. Most of the common card games are turn-based, and each attack must be operated. Automatic combat is just different from these games. I hope this will give players a more relaxed and newer experience. 3, because of the limited resources, we reduced the need for art as much as possible in the initial stage, and decided to make cards with pure numbers and no graphics. This will not make the game more fun. It is purely for cost considerations. I hope that I will have the opportunity to make up for each card in the future. Beautifully painted on the stand. 4, there should be a resource consumption for every card played, and the consumption of cards of different values is also different, so the output of resources must be controlled; since it is an automatic battle, resources can only be released on time. So there are two countdown timers in the game, one is the countdown for the card deal, and the other is the countdown for the resource release. After these rules are determined, first draw a 9*9 grid on a piece of paper to simulate the game scene; then cut some small pieces of paper, write serial numbers and values on them, and simulate cards; then design dozens of types Skills, assigned to different cards, Then use a table to determine the basic value of attack blood for each card; then use a notepad to record the battle process. In this way, first use a simple tabletop game to simulate the battle process, and experience whether this gameplay is fun or not. It feels good after playing. Some values and parameters have been adjusted. Play a few more games, and it still feels very fun. Only then began to refine, determine more details, and then make it into an automatic battle game.",
