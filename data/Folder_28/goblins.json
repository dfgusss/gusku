Each level consists of several attack waves with a build phase in between each, and then an upgrade phase at the end of each level where you can permanently upgrade your catapult and defenses. Build Phase Use gold you've accrued from defeating goblins to enhance your defenses. Strategic placement of buildings will help funnel enemies as well as provide additional attack capability during gameplay.

If the goblins get away with your treasure chests, you lose. Upgrade Phase Apply permanent upgrades to your defenses.
