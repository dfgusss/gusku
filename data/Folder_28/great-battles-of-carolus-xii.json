    "About the game": "With God's help, fight for the glory of Svea Rike! The king, Carolus XI is dead, the royal castle is in ashes and the people of Sweden are starving to death in the harsh winter. With bloodshed, the enemies of Sweden are now concluding an attack alliance. Russia, Denmark and Saxony-Poland are waiting to attack the Swedish borders. The new fifteen-year-old King, Carolus XII stands alone with the fate of the kingdom in his hands. In Great Battles of Carolus XII, the player will experience battles such as: The Battle of Pühhajoggi 1700 The Battle of Narva 1700 The Battle of Gemauerthof 1705 The Battle of Fraustadt 1706 The Siege of Veprik 1709 Each battle lasts about 30-60 minutes. The player gets to command the Swedish army. The infantry, cavalry and artillery of the army deal different amounts of damage to each other: An artillery volley will be effective against infantry, pikemen, and cavalry because of their tight formations. However, artillery won't deal much damage against other artillery because they are much harder to hit than tightly packed formations of men. An infantry volley will be less effective against an artillery unit. It will only deal half of its firepower because of the less tight artillery formations. A bayonet charge will be effective against infantry and artillery but will only deal a third of its damage against cavalry or pikemen. Note that the 'bayonet charge' ability also has a cooldown and cannot be used every round. A cavalry charge will be very effective against all units except for pikemen. A pike charge will be very effective against infantry and quite effective against artillery and other pikemen. However, it will be less effective against cavalry because it is a very mobile unit. There are more great battles coming in future updates!",
