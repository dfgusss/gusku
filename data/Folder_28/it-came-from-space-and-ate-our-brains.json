    "About the game": "It came from space and ate our brains is a unique arcade top-down shooter . Looking for addicting gameplay elements, four-player local co-op mode, and tons of aliens to send into oblivion? Yes, yes and yes? You’re in the right place! A merciless alien species has invaded the Earth and they feed on human brains (duh). Wander atmospheric locations as a no-nonsense kind of guy with the two essentials in life—a flashlight and something to turn aliens into goo. Things look pretty bad and there’s chaos everywhere! Time to save the world! Again! Enjoy new features and a major visual overhaul as you boost your high score even higher. Become a pro in no time with a brand new prologue to the game. The re-balanced difficulty makes shooting aliens even more fun for both new and experienced players. Can you make it through endless hordes of brain-eating aliens? We mean, like, with your brain intact and everything. Prove it!",
