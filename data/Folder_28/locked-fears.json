    "About the game": "You are working at UNIVERS HORIZONS - a multinational conglomerate company. Being one of the biggest corporations in the world, it comprises numerous subsidiaries and affiliated businesses. It is highly diversified, with activities in areas including construction, electronics, machinery, financial services, food processing, textiles, insurance, securities and medical services. Thanks to your performance, you have been recently moved from the business analyst position, to the development branch. You notice right away the tight security in the new building. Phones or cameras are not allowed in the offices, but instead are left at the security checkpoint, and the sent emails are manually checked and filtered. As an extra secrecy measure the items you are dealing have no names, only id codes, so no one knows what they contain. Due to being new at this job you have much to learn, so working overtime in the night is a standard occurrence. Only you shouldn't have, especially this night.",
