    "About the game": "Defense simulation game 1 to 4 players can play. ---------------------------------------------------------- -Story- You are the village chief. Just when you thought the promised slow life was waiting for you... A monster that attacks without end! Almost a one-man operation! Black Village! Work to get materials, money and hire mercenaries to defend your village. ---------------------------------------------------------- You can make an axe, pickaxe, hoe, and fishing rod on your workbench. You can collect materials from trees with an axe and stones with a pickaxe. The material will revive after a certain amount of time. You can bury the seeds in the field with a mulberry when you have the seeds. Eating food will increase your maximum SP by 1. If you act with [X button], your SP is reduced by 1. Resting at home will restore your SP. If you run out of SP, you will fall down and a doctor will come to your aid. But they will take money. Merchants will appear several times a day. You can sell wood, stone, food, or buy seeds. The monsters will progress to the village. When the monster reaches the village, the game is over. Hire and intercept mercenaries for food and money. Wages = mercenary's HP. The red gauge time period consumes SP, so go home to sleep. Saving is done automatically in the morning. ---------------------------------------------------------- This game is gamepad recommended. See in-game for instructions on how to use the gamepad. -keyboard operation- Movement: cross keys Work: z Decision: x Cancel: c Equipment Toggle: A Or D Entering a house, using a workbench or furnace: s Reset: F5",
