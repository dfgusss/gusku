    "About the game": "Mindfulness Simulator - ASMR Meditation Game experiences designed to calm your mind, inspire and drift away. Wander freely through the forest as your own Ego or as a Stone. Explore the procedurally-generated environment listening to Alan Watts' teachings about Mindfulness, Meditation, Peace and Love. Play with ASMR Grass when you roll over it with varying weather and time of day. Just be mindful. Wind down in compelling natural environment with dense atmospheres accompanied with original soundtrack composed exclusively to relax with help of binaural beats. Designed to inspire and relax the game embody visually psychedelic effects that are research-backed to encourage individuals to explore their consciousness and deeper inner states. Mainly for those experiencing heightened stress levels, restlessness, and other mental health issues. After a free session aspects of the environment and mood will have transformed. After entering the world, you are faced with a time of day and a weather somewhere in the world. You are also placed somewhere in a procedurally-generated forest being able to walk, explore and get lost completely. As a stone you can: go back to your ego listen to Alan Watts' wisdoms roll on the ASMR grass fly through the forest join wind in the breathing session travel in time travel in space The game features many biomes that you can simply watch (and hopefully in the future, interact): critters (4 species and growing) insects (butterflies, flies, mosquitos and more) mammals (with predators like wolf or fox) birds (more than 12 species) What it is NOT Don't expect fast-paced action, gamification / quests, huge open-world levels or complex scene interaction (more interactions with the environment are likely to follow though). Please take a look at the recommended specs and try the demo first to test performance. This application is resource intensive. - Much care is taken to optimize it, while still trying to keep a decent quality. It's a tight-rope walk. The hope is that you don't have to care too much about technical aspects or performance issues and can just enjoy the game. If you encounter any issues or have feedback of any sort, feel invited get in contact via Steam Discussions or Discord before writing a review. There you can also access more infos about known issues and solutions, change-log and roadmap.",
