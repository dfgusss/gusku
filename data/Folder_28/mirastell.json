Overview Mirastell is a 2D Action-RPG with a unique flavor of turn-based combat, set on an abandoned space cruiser. Mirastell starts you off with no memories of your past, no equipment, and no allies. It’s up to you to explore the ship, learn about its history, discover the fate of the crew, and eventually escape. The ship’s passengers and crew may be missing, but you will quickly realize that you are not alone. Also onboard is The Arcadia, a mysterious and hostile AI that is constantly present throughout the game. The Arcadia is always watching, and always trying to stop you. To help you in your struggle against the Arcadia, Mirastell contains a wealth of equipment for you to unlock, including weapons, armor, and combat mods. These tools create a deep sense of progression and allow for a wide variety of combat styles. Features A deep narrative, woven into nearly every mechanic of the game, including death! Combat that is as challenging as the player wants Deep progression that lets the player choose how they want to fight A wealth of secrets and puzzles to solve, offering both rare loot and narrative development as rewards Replayable dungeons that allow the player to flex their combat mastery, and earn valuable rewards Stealth mechanics that allow the player to set themselves up for combat success Diverse array of enemies, keep combat fresh and engaging Unique bosses that force the player to rethink the way they approach combat A wide array of unique level mechanics Light puzzle solving Multiplayer/Co-op Gameplay Weapons Mirastell has a large collection of weapons to choose from, each with its own unique feel. They can be unlocked through a variety of methods, including crafting, completing quests, or discovering them in the world. Upgrades Some weapons can be upgraded to gain additional perks. These upgrades are obtained in the same way as normal weapons and are meant as a way to ensure that you are able to invest time into your favorite equipment, and perfect your loadout. Armor Armor can be collected in similar ways to weapons and upgrades, and provides perks or stat-boosts that help you during combat. Mods Combat mods are craftable items that improve your performance during combat. These mods come in 4 tiers, and you can have 1 mod of each tier equipped at a time. During combat, defeating an enemy will give you 1 point of energy, activating your tier 1 combat mods. Defeating more enemies will activate more mods, powering you up as you fight the Arcadia. Mods are built to work well with other specific mods, weapons, and armor pieces. Carefully combining these tools will allow you to become extremely powerful. World and Story Mirastell’s story is shrouded in mystery. Over the course of three years, this narrative has been developed into a dense web which you will slowly unravel as you play. Our goal is to provide a simple, and satisfying plot that can be understood by anyone, and a deeper story for those who are more interested in digging into the story. The game will even have multiple endings, depending on the decisions you make along the way. The Arcadia is an important part of the game’s story, and its relationship with the player develops over the course of the game. The Arcadia is present at all times, constantly taunting the player, and impeding their success.",
