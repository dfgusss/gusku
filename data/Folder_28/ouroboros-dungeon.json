    "About the game": "The Ouroboros Dungeon is a cursed place. There is no end to it. As the Ouroboros symbol of the snake eating its own tail. A cursed hero is set upon the challenge to break this loop. Will you be strong enough? This game takes all the pleasure from the 90's Action RPGs and puts into a quirky infinite procedural dungeon. You will explore a infinite amount of corridors and rooms, finding treasures and loot to get stronger to face the challenge. But be careful, there is no place safe in the dungeon. Watch for the enemies strategy, as they also evolves throughout the gameplay. - ACTION RPG - INFINITE DUNGEON CRAWLER - NO LEVEL CAP - INIFINITE EQUIPMENT STATS AND COMBINATIONS - MULTIPLE CHOICES OF WEAPONS - THERE IS NO SINGLE NOR RIGHT PATH FOR A GOOD STRATEGY",
