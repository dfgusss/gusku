    "About the game": "Take control of Peter as he travels across the kingdom, solving puzzles, making friends and defeating monsters! All interface, dialogue and narration is in simple English accompanied by carefully designed images and animations to help you understand the game play and objectives. You wont be hit with walls of text every time you speak with a character in this game. This is not a classroom, there are no quizzes or word matching exercises. The purpose of this game is to provide a fun and challenging world for you to explore. FEATURES Over 65 fully voice acted characters to meet. Auto-saved progress and no death mechanic encourages experimentation without risk. Over 4000 lines of in-game English dialogue with American and British accents. Approximately 15-20 hours of game play. FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 'How is this different to just playing any regular game in English' Games with language simple enough for beginners typically don't require much language comprehension to play. (Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. We've used simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. 'Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?' It's currently also available in Spanish under the title 'Pedro's Adventures in Spanish'. If there is sufficient support for this game then we will continue to release versions of the game to help players learn many other languages. 'Will it be available on other platforms? (macOS, Android, consoles etc)' Initially it will only be available for Windows PC, but soon we hope to release the game for macOS, Linux, consoles and mobile devices. A WORD FROM THE CREATORS This game is one of many resources you should use when learning a language and is particularly useful for learning common nouns, verbs and pronunciation. We recommend playing it in conjunction with resources that focus on teaching the nuances of grammar and verb conjugation. ROCKET BOY GAMES is an independent games studio with the objective of providing fun alternatives to your language learning experience. With enough support we hope to create a variety of language learning games for a variety of other languages. We hope you will be part of that journey. Good luck! Chaz and Andrea Rocket Boy Games",
