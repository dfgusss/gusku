Rats occupy themselves by working and earning money, which they can later spend on food, water and other commodities. However, despite their perfect, stress-free living conditions, Rodent People can no longer bear their boring routine and decide to break out of the prison cell and find out the mystery behind why they were incarcerated in the first place.",
