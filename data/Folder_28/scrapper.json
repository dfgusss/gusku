Use your hard earned scrap from completing missions and challenges to purchase new ships, wings, and thrusters. These parts change how your ship moves and looks, allowing you to prepare for the different missions and fly with your own style. Players will get the chance to compete with their friends and others players around the world as they attempt to gain the highest scores and secure bragging rights as the best pilot in the galaxy!",
