Key Features Forge new friendships, rivalries, and connections through card game conversations. Play cards to match the tone and perspective of your partner or disregard their feelings to sell your own point of view. The story continues either way. Venture forth to find rare and useful goods to aid your town. Make difficult choices along the way. The consequences shape your character’s deck and every conversation that follows, en route to many possible endings. You'll explore the world, but also explore what it means to return home.

Who will you become, and what will you leave behind?",
