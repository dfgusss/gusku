The game also comes with an optional balance level indicator that lets you know if you're in level before starting to balance. It looks like this: The game has a set of challenges and cosmetic rewards for completing the challenges. Here are the challenges: How to play? Use your controllers to keep the balance. If you for example start falling to the left, raise your left hand and lower your right hand to regain balance. Keep your arms outstretched for maximum balance. If you hold your controllers close to each other, you will loose your balance. Press the trigger to interact with the UI. Press A to start balancing or to try again after falling. Press B to go back to the main menu. This is a game under development. Updates will come! Please let me know if you have any requests and ideas, or experience any bugs/problems!",
