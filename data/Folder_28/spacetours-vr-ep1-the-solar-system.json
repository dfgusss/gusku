Avoid DEIMOS, the unstable moon of Mars. If you can't, well you read about armed support earlier didn't you? Saturn Nobody does Saturn like CASSINI-HUYGENS does. For the ultimate dust-ring-sparkle-action, just point your beam at her. Jupiter Don't miss out on Jupiter with all the moons around. (He's on the right.) Mercury You thought the Caribbean was the ultimate place to worship the sun? Wait till you've been on mercury! A sunscreen with UV-factor not less then 7e³ is highly recommended. Venus That's not the Venus I know! See what's really under Venus' cloudy cloths - MAGELLAN is the man. Neptune Wait what?! NEW HORIZONS on Neptune?! Well, where else can you go when your home got revoked planetary status. Uranus [ˈju(ə)rənəs] is how it is pronounced. *destinations sorted by visitor popularity.",
