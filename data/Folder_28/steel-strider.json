Overview: STEEL STRIDER is the follow up to the acclaimed GIGANTIC ARMY and pays homage to the great run and gun games such as Turrican and Super Contra , but adds mouse / dual analogue stick-operated weapons! It is the second half of the twentieth century. A long period of galaxy-wide conflict and turmoil is finally drawing to a close, but skirmishes and large scale crime are still commonplace, some criminal operations possess personnel and armaments equivalent to small armies. The official peace-keeping authorities are insufficiently equipped tackle these threats, and the galactic military lacks the flexibility to effectively neutralize them. There exists, however, a secret organization that secretly strives to preserve peace in the galaxy: ARGO EXPRESS. When ARGO EXPRESS receives word of emergencies such as distress signals or major crime outbreaks, they dispatch a carrier ship disguised as a freighter to rush to the scene and resolve the situation. STEEL STRIDER is the story of an ARGO EXPRESS operative and Gemini-class MCR (Manned Combat Robot) pilot who troubleshoots emergencies in planets around the galaxy. Features: • 4 planets of intense mech-shooting action to clear! • Mid and end level bosses of gargantuan proportions to take down! • Four difficulty modes from ‘Easy’ to ‘Insane’ to cater for all skill levels! • 8 upgradeable weapons with which to mete out galactic justice! • Jetpack to give your mech satisfying maneuverability and defensive options! • Keyboard and mouse or dual analog stick controls! • Achievements, online leader boards, trading cards, and more! • Outstanding value: only $5.99!! ★★★ STEEL STRIDER ★★★★ Created by ASTRO PORT ASTRO PORT is a three-man Japanese development team whose collective message to the world is, ‘This is how fun action shooting games can be!” ASTRO PORT’s deep catalog of solid shooting games also includes Supercharged Robot Vulkaiser , ARMED SEVEN , Witch-bot Meglilo , SATAZIUS , and GIGANTIC ARMY .",
