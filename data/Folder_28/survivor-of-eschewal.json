You are swimming for your life in the dead of night with nothing but the clothes on your back. Suddenly you wake up and find yourself on a beach of a strange island. This island does not feel right from the start because you could have swarn this island was not here the previous night. Now all you can think of is getting off this island alive. With nothing but a fire axe wash ashore you begin harvesting resources and try to survive until you can get off the island. But this is not normal island when you suddenly find giant strange metal bugs attacking you, they continue in their attack getting bigger and stronger and all you can do is try to fight them off, if you hope to leave this island you need to find out the story of the island first.",
