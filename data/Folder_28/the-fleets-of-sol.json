    "About the game": "What is The Fleets of Sol? The Fleets of Sol is an strategy-survival game that focuses on commanding a fleet of capital ships as you jump from sector-to-sector in search of stranded civilian transports while constantly being pursued by an enemy determined to bring about your fleet's destruction. Current Features *Pick from multiple commanders, as each provides a unique bonus that can radically change how you approach your journey. *Each jump is a leap into the unknown as you encounter distress calls, interdiction forces, and enemy strongholds. *Order your ships carefully and engage or avoid hostile forces as you wait for your jump drives to come online. *The relentless enemy are prepared to intercept you at every turn and will even use hijacked friendly ships filled with warheads to weaken your resolve. *When enough civilians have been saved, begin the final journey to your new home planet while the enemy hatches a plan to stop you once and for all. *Command a variety of capital ships as well as countless small fighter craft.",
