    "About the game": "Sburb, But Real The Genesis Project is the Homestuck fandom's attempt at recreating SBURB, the legendary world-ending game from the webcomic Homestuck. Build your way up through each gate and defeat unique enemies, bosses, and stairs. Play In Co-op Play a no-canon solo session, or create lobbies and play with your friends to wreak havoc upon the universe! Create New Items Use the revolutionary tag-based Alchemy system to combine absolutely any two items together... as long as you have the grist! More to Come! Join The Genesis Project Discord server, see what we're working on next, and talk to the devs directly! Your suggestions and help are always invaluable. Totally Free, Completely Non-profit Homestuck, SBURB, and many other concepts in this game are the intellectual property of Andrew Hussie, writer of Homestuck. This game is merely a labor of love from the fans of his works; it will always be free and will never profit from his creations.",
