    "About the game": "The Line is a rogue-like / dungeon crawler / survival with a turn-based combat system. The main object is to stand out the long line for resettlement from the oppressive east segment of the city. The game begins when authorities decide to show a gesture of goodwill and move people from the rotting district to new buildings. Our protagonists are the girl Angelina and her companion - mutated dog Fin. This girl is a part of the small group, that want to know about true nature of the resettlement. The queue moves extremely slowly, so you have to fight your way through or negotiate. Angelina can use turn-based combat, she has six attacks most of them have cooldowns. Four attacks can do buffs and debuffs and others can deal different amount of damage. The second way to move forward is to identify the mental weakness of the enemies and use them. The third way is to simply exchange place for items from the inventory. The dog Fin can do searching in special places, in which people can’t reach. Player evaluable to loot chests, boxes, tables and other objects. Other games in the same city Blind Boris (sequel to the Line) / Marginal act (prequel to the Line) /",
