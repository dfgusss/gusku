    "About the game": "Story Thousand years ago, The civilization was almost completely wiped out after a great war. Centuries had passed, almost no one remembers the once glorious empire. But, when the ancient history strikes back, you, the half god protagonist has awaken to prevent it to repeat itself all over again... Note This game's main focus is to show how much we're capable to do at a short period of time, but since we thought the result wasn't actually sellable, we decided to release this game for free. This is a student project, it may contain various issues and we CANNOT guarantee these will be fixed due to the reason mentioned below. We're planning to start a studio after graduation and Military services(according to Taiwan law we have to finish it unfortunately). For those who liked our work please stay tuned, hopefully we may roll out some information about our next project when we're back on business.",
