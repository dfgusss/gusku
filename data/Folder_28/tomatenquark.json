    "About the game": "Tomatenquark is a free multiplayer &amp; singleplayer first person shooter, one of the Cube FPS successors. The aim of this game is a fun old school deathmatch gameplay inspired by Quake. Besides deathmatch the game features the rich Cube Engine 2 editor, bringing cooperative map/geometry editing in-game. Tomatenquark is derived from the open source game Cube 2: Sauerbraten . As part of the community, we understand and support the Sauerbraten development line and its developers. We felt that some things should be different, which is why we created Tomatenquark, a completely free and open conversion of the original.",
