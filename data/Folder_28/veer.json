    "About the game": "In Veer, you navigate the world through solving logical puzzles. The core mechanic used to do this is relative teleporting: Jumping between relative positions to pylons in the levels. This, in combination with the ability to change the direction of gravity, are the corner pieces of the game, where everything revolves around and is created for the core experience of puzzle solving. Throughout the game, new ways of using the mechanics are introduced to create a more complex and challenging experience. Turn your world around, teleport yourself past obstacles, and find your way through the temple!",
