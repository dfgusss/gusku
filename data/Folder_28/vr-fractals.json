    "Release date": "Jul 26, 2016",
    "About the game": "VR Fractals is a 3D Fractal Viewer for the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive. To use this you must have one of those headsets. This is an experience similar to Oculus Dreamdeck, so expect about 5-20 minutes of gameplay. Right now there are 8 fractals. A code editor is included which will allow users to create their own fractals/shaders and share them with the community. More fractals might be added in later updates as well. There is a free demo available with one fractal and no editor that should give you a pretty good jist of what to expect.",
