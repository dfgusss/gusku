    "About the game": "Come to Harnold’s theater and take part in the shows using attack machines to face enemies. Whole wars were won by the use of Math. Developed for those who like to exercise their brain or want to gain agility in mathematics. In ‘War Solution’ your calculation skills and agility of reasoning will be put to the test to solve puzzles and destroy the enemies, however agility alone won’t be enough to win the battles, to succeed you’ll also have to equip yourself or draw some combat strategies. It's time to challenge yourself! Can you win this war? Can you beat your family and friends? Come to Harnold’s theater and take part in his play, go the show by showing your agility and math skills off, battle against other reigns (Adventure mode) or against your friends and family (Versus mode). The faster and precise your answers, more advantages you will obtain to help you in the next battles. Here are some examples: Boosters - To protect your attack machine against the next attack from your opponent a shield will appear. - In the next 8 seconds, your attack hits the enemy tower directly. Mockery - In the next 8 seconds, your enemy's attack is blocked. - Remove any booster or mockery that the opponent has accumulated. (exclusive on Versus mode) Have fun with 05 unmissable game modes: - Save the Cerebine Kingdom from collapse by facing ever more challenging enemy reigns. - Destroy the enemy's tower before time runs out or weep in your tower’s wreckage. - Great place to train, here you will face random battles with random difficulties. - This game mode is for the strong! All your skill and agility will be put to the test. Will you stand it up? - Challenge your friends and family to battle. Who will win? - P.S.: To be able to play the game on 'Versus mode', 02 controllers connected to your computer will be needed. Acquire “Neurons” and “Gold”, to buy new attack machines, towers, etc… - In the War Solution each Attack Machine and Tower has its own attributes that make all the difference in a combat where each second counts. And some of them may have special abilities. Attack machines: Skins: Defense towers: Skins: Avatars: Collect ensigns: - Every time you achieve the gold standard of the battle, , you will conquer the ensign of the defeated kingdom. Collecting all the ensigns of the show (12 reigns), you will earn a good prize in gold and neurons. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: - The size of the damage your attack will cause on the enemy will be proportional to your agility to correctly answer the questions, so, the faster you correctly answer it, greater will be the damage your attack will inflict on the enemy, limited to the attribute of your machine - It’s not a good strategy to click randomly on any alternative, because every wrong answer reduces your resolution time and also decreases your attack power. - Agility will be rewarded during the battle with 'surprise boxes' that will randomly appear on the game screen – this boxes may contain 'mockery' or 'boosters'. Be smart and grab them, otherwise your adversary will do it. - Caution: by grabbing a 'surprise box', its content will replace any unused advantage that you have conquered. - Never give up! Even if you have lost your attack machine… If you master the next 03 questions, you will recover it. - Your attack machine can be regained, as the one of your enemy. You got to act quickly to destroy its tower, after destroying its attack machine this way its machine will not be regained - There are some tips to speed your thinking up in the game book.",
