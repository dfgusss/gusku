Experience all the peril and danger of the Warhammer world as you battle your enemies through Chaos ridden dungeons. Encounters come to life as your warriors enter the fray with a vast array of weapons and skills. Hold your enemies back with fire, use ice to freeze them to the spot, or poison them with lethal toxins. Attack with magic staffs, explosive pistols and flaming hammers. If all else fails use legendary armour or mystical robes to deflect attacks. Heroes and Enemies! A variety of different heroes and enemies bring huge tactical variety to the dungeons. From Sorceresses and Mages, to Witch Hunters and Knights. Find which characters best suit your playstyle. Choose from 12 different Hero classes. All with unique weapons, armours, skills and items!

Figure out which combination is most effective for bashing the enemy! Easy to learn, hard to master. Engage in deep tactical gameplay as you encounter new enemies with new devious abilities that will test your strategic ability to its limits. Can you defeat the Chaos invasion? Only the mightiest will survive in Warhammer Quest 2: The End Times!",
