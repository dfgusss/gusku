    "About the game": "Zombie Builder Defense is an action packed top down shooter about surviving the zombie apocalypse with a shop full of weapons and a handful of turrets. Test your skills against the onslaught as one of the few remaining humans on earth and build your base to last, because the horde will stop at nothing in this ruthless battle to the end. Will you survive, or perish like the rest? 4 Player Multiplayer Co-op! Enlist the help of friends and take on the infected with up to four players in multiplayer co-op. Play with friends, or strangers, and vote to start waves sooner. The Infected 40 Waves 5 Zombie Types 4 Unique Bosses Multiplayer Scaled Waves Endless Mode - Now Added! Test your resolve and try your hand at the newest mode - ENDLESS. No shop, no leveling, just blood, bullets and zombies to the death. Weapons From pistols to SMG's, shotguns to sniper rifles, mow down the hordes of infected with your choice of over 20 weapons including assault rifles and rocket launchers. Don't forget to set a few claymores for good measure. The Shop Access the shop between waves to purchase much needed ammo, weapons, and barricades to help survive the night. For the right price you can even buy a turret or trap. Power-Ups As if you needed any more reason to kill zombies, each mob has a chance to drop a unique power up to help you clear the wave. Grab them quickly, they won't last for long. The Skill Tree Earn experience with every kill and take it with you when you die. It's just like riding a bike, right? Keep earned skill points that transfer between games and use them on the 37 point Skill Tree to unlock perks and weapons along the way. Base Building No one ever survived the zombie apocalypse standing out in the open. Purchase barricades, lights, traps and turrets at the shop between waves and build your base however you like. Don't forget to upgrade both your barricades and your turrets or else, just like you, they won't survive very long.
