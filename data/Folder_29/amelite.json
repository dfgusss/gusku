Find yourself at the bottom of an abandoned and mystical tower, overgrown by dangerous crystals. With the help of a peculiar creature, climb your way to the top through an ever challenging environment, and find your way home. Leap over gaping holes, block incoming projectiles, or wall-jump in tandem with your own walls. Amelite is a game packed with creative challenges, and every player is free to make their own solutions! This game has been developed for PC, and using a mouse is highly recommended. The game is also compatible with drawing tablets.",
