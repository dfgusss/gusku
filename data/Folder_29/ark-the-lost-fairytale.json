    "About the game": "Narrator launches its 2014 exploration game 《ARK - The Lost Fairytale》 on Steam! Different from other exploration games where you solve puzzles through 'logical reasoning', this game focuses on using association and story connection to solve puzzles. Features: ＋ Puzzles are based mainly on fairytales. Hints are given through reading the many fairytales scattered throughout the game. ＋ Several original fairytales. ＋ Tested by many players, it is considered moderately difficult with mild horror elements; not overly difficult, but not too easy. ＋ Many small and surprising easter-eggs. ＋ Steam achievements and trading cards. (trading cards will be enabled by Steam once enough copies of the game are sold) － The True End does not explicitly end the story. The final challenge is to guess what will happen next!

Noozu A little boy found in the Twilight Garden. Younger than even Nui, he's very timid and physically weak. With the help of Nui, he's able to move forward. Lin As Nui walked home from school, this girl appeared across the road. Lured by her, Nui left the safety of the sidewalk to venture into the long, narrow alley...",
