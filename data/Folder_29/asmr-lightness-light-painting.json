    "About the game": "NOTE FROM DEVELOPER This app (ASMR game) was created for my friend (psychologist). The application helps to reduce stress and improve mood. But now it can also be used as a game, because I added 60 levels to the game, Steam achievements etc. ABOUT GAME ASMR LIGHTness - Light painting is an atmospheric puzzler with lights, beautiful aesthetic and an extraordinary atmosphere of an unknown world. The lights cannot overlap, because they lose all their power. Use your ability to untangle them, but remeber... The more You move the lights the more difficult it becomes! ABOUT SANDBOX In Sandbox mode, You can draw objects using lights. The only thing that limits you is your imagination. For example I created a mouse cursor and I am proud of myself: HOW TO USE TO REDUCE STRESS If you want to reduce stress and improve your mood, you need to obey the rules: 1) Use headphones, the game uses ASMR / 3D / Binaural music and sounds. 2) It is absolutely essential to play ASMR LIGHTness in a very quiet room with a properly configured gamma. Failure to do so will reduce the atmosphere 3) Recommended: START NEW GAME (not Sandbox) 4) Choose your color (there is a square in right corner) 5) Focus on the light 6) One session must last 30-60 minutes. 7) Go to sleep now.
