    "About the game": "Design the cars of your dreams, and build an automotive business empire with them! Choose to make cars that evoke excitement and set the imagination alight, or cars that are the literal wheels the world’s economy rolls upon; with Automation, the possibilities are limited only by your imagination! Automation is an automotive design simulator, featuring vehicles and technologies from 1946 to 2020. Use Automation’s unparalleled engine and car design tools to create your perfect car, then build and market them to a car-hungry public in the Campaign Mode! Export your creations to BeamNG.drive (sold separately) with the one-click export tool and share them with others, or experience them for yourself on the road and on track! Realise your dreams with one-of-a-kind car design tools. In Automation, players use the comprehensive engine and car design tools to turn their ideas into reality; shape, cut, re-shape and adorn thousands of car bodies with a wide variety of lights, mouldings and other parts to achieve the style you want. Design the perfect engine to go in your car; whether it is a large, powerful V12 or a small, efficient inline-3, nearly all common engine layouts are possible! Test your business skills by selling your designs in Campaign Mode. Automation’s Campaign Mode starts in 1946, where players test their design skills in a deep simulation of the automotive industry. Build factories and equip them with the facilities and equipment they need, and research cutting-edge technologies to turn your fledgling company into a titan of the industry, by catering to the needs and desires of dynamically-simulated market demographics. Export your cars to BeamNG.drive. Export your creations to BeamNG.drive (sold separately) with Automation’s easy-to-use car exporter to drive, race and crash them yourself! Compare your lap times against Automation's AI and your friends in BeamNG.drive with the co-developed Automation Test Track featured in both games, and share your creations in the BeamNG.drive Mod Repository. Participate in Automation’s passionate and active community. Automation has a large community of 3D modellers creating mod content for the game, with hundreds of free mods available on the Steam Workshop, and more being added every day. Additionally, the Automation community runs a wide variety of exciting, community-designed and led competitions, where cars are evaluated on styling, performance and other traits. Build a car and join the community today, to see how your creations measure up against your new friends!",
