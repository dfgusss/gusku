    "About the game": "Somewhere, deep in the Siberian wilderness, 26 letters play a deadly game of survival. Babble Royale is a game of high-speed, word-based combat. You are the last word you made. Eliminate an opponent by quickly connecting your word to theirs, before they do. 16 Players - 1 Winner Have the last word, or die trying. Stay Alive The deadly hot zone is creeping in from the edges of the map, forcing players together for the final showdown. Collect Loot From fallen enemies and power-ups scattered around the map. Level Up Earn money by making words. Spend money to get more letters faster, and acquire powerful items from the shop. Win Through raw word-making ability or by outwitting your opponents with clever tactics. Golden Royales ???? ??? ??? ? ??????? ???? ?? ??? ???? ? ?????? ?????? ????? ????? ??? ????? ?? ? ?????? ??????. Customize Express your inner Babbler. The store has a range of skins, hats, and emotes for you to earn or purchase. We made Babble Royale for competitive gamers who like smart games, and casual gamers who like intense competition. The combination of classic word-making gameplay with fast-paced tactical action means the game is easy to learn but has an insanely high skill ceiling. Season Zero is our early access launch. Over the next few months we look forward to expanding the game with new content and features and working with our player community to make the game as great as it can be. We hope you'll join us!",
