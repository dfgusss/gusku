    "About the game": "Your squad crash-landed behind enemy lines, in the heart of an alternate history Eastern Europe. With no intel or leadership to support them, these soldiers must fight their way back home before the horrors of war break them. Teamwork and strategy are paramount... Each soldier has their own personality and ideas on what needs to happen next. Some want to investigate what caused the crash that left them in hostile territory, while others want to lay low and wait for rescue. Some even whisper of desertion. You are the “unseen hand” that guides this ragtag group of soldiers to safety and possible salvation. Whether it’s as simple a choice as which way to go next, or something as serious as how to engage their mysterious foes, every decision you make bears weight and has an impact. Story-Driven Gameplay As your soldiers battle the mental strain of war, you’ll need to command them in combat— will they avoid the enemy, or go head to head with their foes? Plan and execute While a turn-based game at its heart the game unfolds in real-time, only giving you a short respite to choose the next actions for your team. You have to adapt to the ever-changing battlefield on the fly and prove your strategic acumen. React to change, adapt to your surroundings and live through the consequences of your actions. Choices Matters Every decision made by you will shape the path ahead of the squad. Your soldiers, who will have their own opinion about the events, are not the only people who will be affected by them. Villages may get burned or saved, entire regions may go dark or fall under the enemy influence - so try to balance your team morale and stand by choices you feel are right. Tactical Action with Included Expansion The critically acclaimed gameplay formula is back - now with zombies! Scout the battlefield, lure undead hordes into skirmishes with your enemies, then once both sides are suitably weakened, charge in and mop up the survivors in one fell swoop - or bring out the biggest guns in your arsenal and simply blast your sorrows away. Just make sure to watch your back as the undead will come from all directions. Booze and Guns When facing undead horrors one could use the perks given by liquid courage. Literally. The more your soldiers drink, the more perks and abilities they get. Combine it with the vast arsenal left behind by the cowards who ran for their lives when they first saw the undead and you end up having a surprisingly diverse armament and abilities, perfect in your fight against the zombie apocalypse!",
