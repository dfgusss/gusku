    "About the game": "You play as Joy, a lost controller trying to find their buttons back after you've been smashed to pieces. As a 2D platformer, you will have to cross a cyberpunk style city, and a fantasy filled forest using the simple buttons you can find, and some of the more advanced ones. You may start with only being able to move to the left, or the right, and it is your job to use your movement abilities to find the rest of them. Over each level you will find your normal movement abilities scattered across the world, such as moving to the left, the right, and jumping. The move advanced buttons you'll find are the grappling hook, dash, and shoot ability. Good luck, and watch out for dragons.",
