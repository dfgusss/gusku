Create your own 3D worlds and 3D models, set camera controllers, materials, behaviors, click 'publish' and your game or app is ready. As Windows or Mac OS X apps, WebGL websites, or Android apps. You can do all this without programming. The engine is free but there is also a professional edition (DLC): It adds post effects like bloom and the option to customize the splash screen logo.
