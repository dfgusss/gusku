    "About the game": "Dead is a Top-Down Zombie Shooter that was released in 2020 as a free game (still is) to give people something fun and free to play. DEAD was created in 2020 as a Free Arcade game designed to kill time and have a little fun. It supports Couch Co-Op as well as Steam Remote play so you can play with your friends on-or-offline. It is the classic COD Zombies Experience but as a fun Arcade game that I made for fun. This is the Prequel to DEAD 2 and is part of the much larger Gigastructure Story. DEAD is no longer featuring large updates but will still receive support, and fixes as reported and as long as I still have the files on my computer :)",
