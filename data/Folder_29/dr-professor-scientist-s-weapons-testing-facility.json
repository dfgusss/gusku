    "Release date": "Mar 8, 2022",
    "About the game": "Discipline Science, as all human endeavors, has been splintered into several factions who believe their way of thinking is the best. The Dr. Professor Scientist is no different albeit his faction is the belief that his methods are right no matter which he chooses to pursue. Choose one major and one minor discipline. Decide to make a deal with the devil or pursue your childhood dreams of an ever-bouncing superball. Build the Weapon of Your Dreams: The weapon of your dreams is a few projectiles and modifiers away as you devise a cunning plan how to defeat the next enemies. Or if the feelings strikes create a crazy gun with nothing but exploding cabbages in lieu of the more classical energy shard. Survive Waves &amp; Research Weapon Parts Prepare your gun with over 15 different projectiles and 41 increasingly powerful(or wacky) modifiers and decimate the incoming wave. With up to 15 slots in your gun and up to 5 rarities to each Component the combinations are near limitless. For every wave you clear you gain valuable knowledge both in how to build your gun and actual science points— spent to unlock new and interesting modifiers + projectiles. With more at your disposal you can reach further and further into the incoming waves of enemies. And if you are skilled enough, you might beat Grand Daddy Crab... Run Modifiers If you do beat Grand Daddy Crab you unlock the run modifiers which modify your each loop through the game in big ways. The monsters moving backwards, the supergun, tiny tiny monsters and much more. Use your positive modifiers and your big brain to clear through the negative modifiers and beat the game! Desired / Undesired Another grand crab beating benefit is unlocking the desired/undesired slots where you can modify the drop system to suit your liking. Hate the speed component? drop it in undesired. You want rapidfire over anything else? drop it in desired. Tune the system to your gameplay style! If This Weapon Doesn’t pan out? There is always next run. With slight rogue-lite elements you can achieve new heights of gameplay with unlockable modifiers and projectiles. Your research is a priority, after all they don't call you Dr. Professor Scientist for nothing. Will I have to play thousands of hours to enjoy it? Crazy combinations are available right from the beginning, the longer you play the crazier you get. But even short stints in cahoots with Dr. Professor Scientist will leave you satisfied. Haven't had your coffee or morning beverage of choice yet? Don't worry the Dr. Professor Scientist is very accommodating, leaving the grunt work to others, and gives you the ability to play with only one hand. Lending a perfect time to sip on your favorite beverage, as you watch your scientifically important input come to life in the weapon testing phase.",
