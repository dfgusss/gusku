Here lies the Dungeon, rumored to be the prison of the so-called 'Forsaken God'. Either a prison, or a lair, and no one knows what that monster may be doing down there. All we know is that everytime you enter, its structure is different. And his magic is so strong that not only precious loot and monsters are generated inside, but the 'Dungeon Curse' is spreading faster affecting all the Ecallians. You're the new adventurer in town, and your story is up to you. Does the answer lie in the last floor of the Dungeon? Or in a peaceful life in Town, perhaps with a girlfriend and new friends? You're the main character. You get to write his story, from his background to one of the 3 possible endings .
