    "About the game": "General Info: Ezbench is a FREE Stress test tool with next generation technologies from Unreal Engine 5. Test your computer versus 8K textures, Cinematic quality assets and raytracing. EzBench started out as a easter jam project and turned into a graphical stress test tool. It is still early in development and is worked on as a side project. UI improvements, more scenes are coming. The current version includes a stylized scene of a fantasy island. In the future we plan to add photorealistic scenes showcasing the true graphical capabilities of the engine. The current scene is a stress test rather than a showcase of the engine. This tool is a stress test and does represent a worst case scenario. You should expect higher frame rates in optimized games. FAQ: What is the resolution? - The stress test forces 1080P or 4K *render resolution* in order to ensure comparison . What is a stress test? - A stress test is designed to load the GPU as much as possible. In particular this test is extremely heavy on memory. A stress test is great for testing thermals or stability. It isn't intended to showcase game performance, or graphical capabilities of the engine itself. Will you add a Unreal Engine 5 Showcase later on? - We might add a graphical showcase in June! Are there more features planned? Yes! We plan to add a torture test (Loop) as well as improving the UI. Including options to mute the game.

Will give any PC a challenge. While it runs on lower end systems as well, this test will make your RTX 3090 sweat. Logo by: Kalin Mihaylov | Twitter: @Voodoo_KalinMih",
