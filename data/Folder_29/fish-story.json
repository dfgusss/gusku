    "About the game": "This story took place somewhere in the tropics. In the sky, near a large lagoon, glowing lights appeared, so bright that they became visible even under water. And then some objects began to fall from the sky... It is an atmospheric underwater game for the whole family with nice graphics, unforgettable music, achievements and story line. In this game, you have to control a nimble fish. Dodge strange falling objects, keep an eye on hunger levels and look for jewels on the sea bottom! You will visit various underwater locations and meet face to face with the final boss... but maybe he is not a villain...? Help the brave fish solve the mystery of the lights!",
