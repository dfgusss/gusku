    "About the game": "What have we got here? Welp it's simple... Just some water with a bunch of bouyant bodies, you'd say 'so what?' You can set up water parameters like waves altitude, speed, water level, densiry and some more. What do you do with that? Just drop some ships there and watch them 'having fun', and yeah you can build something yourself. Still mot enough, welp, you dont really like those ships if you are asking - yes, there are some explosives too, alright, now go nuke it all. And yeah dont forget to switch your map to one with some rocks... In current state there are 5 explosives and 5 maps, but we will make shure to add more if you'd really like to, but I think it's enough to kill 30 mins",
