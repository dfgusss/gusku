    "About the game": "For Evelyn is an intriguing tale of love, betrayal, and the ultimate sacrifice. The story takes us into the fantasy world of Aura, a place of magic and mysteries. It has been about 700 years since Arcanbreak, a cataclysmic event that changed the world forever. You'll be playing as Yohanna, Evelyn's mother. She’s a strong-willed character, and throughout the game, she will realize how far she is willing to go to protect the ones she loves. With emotional backstories and a powerful, moving musical score, For Evelyn will draw the player in and refuse to let go. Story-driven adventure Well written, partly voiced narrative Original Soundtrack Light RPG elements Point &amp; Click interaction Turn-based battles Retro pixel art graphics Unique character portraits Varied maps to explore Crafting For Evelyn started development in summer 2019, and has gone through several revisions as I've received constructive feedback and have gotten more experience making games. It has been a passion project for me, and I'm doing my best to make it an enjoyable experience for anyone who enjoys story-driven games. Currently, there are many more stories I've planned to bring to you in the coming years. Thank you all who have supported the creation of For Evelyn!",
