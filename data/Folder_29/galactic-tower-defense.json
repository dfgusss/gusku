    "About the game": "Galactic Tower Defense has a different take on the Tower Defense genre. Place towers anywhere to gain a strategic advantage. Choose multiple tower upgrades to maximize your offensive or defensive capabilities. Navigate the battlefield with your drone and become the commander that your adversary's fear. The year is 2242, you are a new hire in one of the more popular and growing private military companies, the Galactic Tower Defense Group. Your company has been hired to conduct operations that the interplanetary Navy (I.N.) cannot or will not partake in. (R. M. E. C) Rare Metal Extraction Companies are harassing and hindering each other’s efforts to compete for prime mining locations across several planets. Some of the, bigger, and more lucrative mining companies, have even begun enlisting the services of the Nozama Corporation. Like us, the Nozama Corporation is a private military company, however their predatory and ruthless approach to ensuring client satisfaction, has been murderous to say the least. Mining companies on the losing end of these so called “Greed Wars”, sought help from the (I.N.) Interplanetary Navy, who are spread too thin across the vast ocean of space. This is where we, you come in. Like the I.N. we are also spread thin, but the money was too good to pass up! Oh, and of course we are concerned about the well-being of those civilians.",
