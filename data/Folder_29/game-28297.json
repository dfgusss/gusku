    "About the game": "[System] As with most roguelike RPGs, levels and equipment will be reset when you return from the dungeon. The game can be cleared in 2-3 hours. If we don't save the ship, we can dive to the 39th depth. Easy roguelike RPG Every time you enter, the items, enemies, and dungeons change shape. Pick up fallen enhancement items, strengthen weapons and armor, and rescue lost ships while defeating enemies! Simple operation with only the four-way controller. But there are traps and special enhancements with money, so it's really deep! Novel part It's not just dungeons! A novel part where you can enjoy serious conversations with the characters is also implemented! The intermission-feeling story that plugs in every time the ship is rescued ends unexpectedly...? [Background Story] One day, I, who loves galgae, was hit by a black-painted luxury car and reincarnated as a commander in the world of Azure Lane. If you talk to her in a casual way or continue to engage in sexual harassment, her likability will be inflated in a negative direction. Just talking to the destroyer was met with contempt in return. If you were an M-ish commander, you'd be able to enjoy every day with the best reverse harem development. I don't like pain, so I was more of an 'S' and lived a more fulfilling life before the reincarnation. After completing my morning routine of vomiting in the bathroom, I came back to the command center and found a Serious with a 0 (not negative!) likability rating. Serious had arrived at the command center. I'm not sure if I can make it to the next level, but I'm not sure if I can make it to the next level.",
