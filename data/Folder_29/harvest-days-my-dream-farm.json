A life on your own little peace of land, surrounded by friendly animals and cheerful neighbors is becoming reality. Take over a small, forgotten farm and become one with nature.

BECOME A FARMER You decide how you develop your field of dreams. But don’t overwork yourself when you take care of the farm animals, plant a dozen different types of fruit trees or more than 50 different crops. Your farm, your choice!

The world of Harvest Days is rich in ressources. Gather wood, stone, minerals, gems and even magic mushrooms. Then build your own tools, furniture and decorations. You dream it – you build it. CATCH A RIDE Take it easy! Walking is healthy – for sure. But neither you nor your horse have to overdo it. The harvest is too bountiful for one farmer? No problem: Invest in heavy hardware to help you with your job. With plenty of vehicles to choose from, you’ll find just about everything you need! EVERY FARM IS UNIQUE Develop your new home as you see fit. The possibilities are endless, there is no right or wrong. If it makes you happy, it can’t be bad.
