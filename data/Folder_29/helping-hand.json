    "About the game": "Imagine this: you’ve been in a horrible car accident, every bone and muscle in your body is broken and the only thing you can use to express yourself is your left hand… Welcome to Helping Hand! This game is about communicating with characters, unlocking new environments and possibly ruling the world - all with just your left hand. Throughout the game, you can use up to seven unique hand gestures to communicate with people and fiddle with your environment. Careful though, try not to anger people too much – your life could depend on it! Helping Hand works with a keyboard and mouse. Each finger within the game relies on a separate input. By default, the controls are: “1” for your pinky finger “2” for your ring finger “3” for your middle finger “4” for your index finger “Space Bar” for your thumb As you press each button, your finger will bend. If you bend your fingers in the right combination, you will form a gesture. Check out the instruction screen if you’re stuck and feel free to change the finger inputs inside the game! Good luck! And try to be nice to Nurse Barbara…",
