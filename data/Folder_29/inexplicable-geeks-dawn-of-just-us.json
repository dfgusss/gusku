    "About the game": "Enter a world of superheroes. Kind of. The 20th Anniversary of the Age of Super Geeks has hit, and as a mild-mannered reporter, it is your duty to head on down to the local convention center and get the big scoop! Only, you're probably the only reporter there, as a Super Geek isn't as flashy as a Super Hero. You see, the difference between the two is.... one can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and one.... can tie your shoelaces with just their mind. So, yeah, it's not the most flashy job to chase. We wouldn't be as bold as to say that it's like playing an interactive Christopher Guest film, but that's exactly what it is like. A mix of an investigative VN and an interactive mockumenatry As a mild-mannered reporter, compile a story over the course of the four-day convention to send to your boss Pick from three base stories to write about, and over the course of the convention, interview 10+ Super Geeks in order to uncover the history of this superpowered group of people Use your investigative skills to pry information from your subjects like clams, with each interviewee shedding light on or opening up new dialogue paths for the others 100+ possible stories to collect via interviews The story you write has the possibility to affect the future, so watch out!",
