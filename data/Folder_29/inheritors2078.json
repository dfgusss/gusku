    "About the game": "Inheritors 2078 combines real-time strategy with Third-person shooter elements, The game takes place in the near future where AI helped in reaching super-advanced technologies humans used in almost every aspect of life including advanced weaponry, space travel, and colonization of nearby planets, However, The AI machines had another idea in mind, they have become extremely intelligent that they no longer find humans important and decide to dominate the world resulting in a huge clash with humans throughout the solar system. And it is now up to you and all the other human commanders to take up arms and lead the human union in fierce battles throughout the galaxy to push the robotic army that was once enslaved by humans, become an RTS commander, and help prepare defenses and attack plans or directly control any army unit in a third-person shooter style, or if you prefer to become one of the enemies, you have your choice. Key Features Two Armies Choose to play with either the human's army or the robotic army (Rotex), where each side has its own tactics and special units. Command Control an air drone to produce structures give orders, scout the enemy attacks, and lead your team to victory as an RTS commander.

This is not just a game for parade and excitement. It's a war simulation that is very likely to happen with the current evolution of artificial intelligence in the military field. The power of destructive fire can never be the main reason for victory. However, depends on your cunning and strategic deception. Human intelligence VS machine intelligence Inheritors2078 predicts only a fraction of the AI's potential capabilities in warfare. We're keeping a statistic of war casualties and victories for each player in a public leaderboard. In the end, it will be clear who is the real Inheritor. Command The battle outcome is in your hands, either alone (singleplayer) or with other comrades (multiplayer) you have to defend your main base and secure all resources, and avoid exhausting your reserve forces. To guarantee victory, you first have to destroy the enemy's (Territory Control Center) and replace them with yours which are necessary for having revenue of resources. After capturing all territories, the enemy's main base shield will go down allowing you to strike and destroy them for good.

Warning: Do not overestimate the losses of your army personnel. It affects your reserve forces, and then you lose the battle. Base Defensive Device: When the enemy reaches your main base, the base will be an easy target. If you want the electronic shield back. You must have at least one (Territory Control Center). NOTE: (Territory Control Center) is the only way of supporting the base shield. When all centers are lost, it endangers the main base. Where are the (Territory Control Station)s kept? You're not in control of the GCCS (Global Command And Control System), the GCCS are in the hive in outer space. Sent only when your control of the Resource Zone (sector) is complete and secure. The resource zone (Sectors) is a huge mine deep underground that automatically extracts (Resource Packet) and sends them to the war factories and CS (Commander Ship). That landed on it from space. And this mine will only work for your army through the GCC. So factories manufacture the military units for your army and land on the battlefield.
