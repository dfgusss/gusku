    "About the game": "L-Racers is a minimalistic, retro, 1980s arcade-style old school game where you go head-to-head against another player (CPU or human) and be the last racer alive. Use your keyboard or an XInput-compatible gamepad, grab a friend and play like it's 1985! Available game modes include: Single player versus CPU, 2-Player local PvP sharing the same keyboard, or both using gamepads, and Local Area Network play. Direct connection to another player over the internet is also possible! This game was created by Joseph Ryan Ries in 2022 as an homage to retro gaming.",
