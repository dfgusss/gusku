    "About the game": "Model ship lovers rejoice! This is a collection of six finely-detailed vessels for viewing at both 'model' and 'actual' size with a VR headset. Stroll their decks as they sail upon a beautifully-rendered ocean with dynamic day/night cycle. Remotely control them at model-scale on a park 'boating' pond, where you can compete against a 'ghost-ship' to capture the most buoys, or pick them up for a closer look. Each ship includes an 'action' event while at sea, whereby mighty cannons fire, ship horns bellow, or the submarine dives. Included Ships: Ocean liner: RMS Queen Mary Zumwalt class destroyer: USS Zumwalt (DDG-1000) Iowa class battleship: USS Iowa (BB-61) Seawolf class submarine: USS Jimmy Carter (SSN-23) English 'race built' galleon: The Mermaid (fictional) Crude oil tanker: ABQAIQ Get more ships in Volume 2: /",
