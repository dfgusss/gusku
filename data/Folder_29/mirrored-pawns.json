Your goal is to successfully navigate 2 pawns across a chess-like board to the goal positions by working with the axes of symmetry provided to you. When either vertical or horizontal symmetry is active, the non-player pawn will move in the opposite vertical or horizontal direction, respectively. You will need to be careful in your movements and use the puzzle board's characteristics to your advantage. Features 50 puzzle levels, each varying in difficulty and strategy Secondary pawn moves equal and/or opposite to player pawn movement, depending on active axes of symmetry Crystal block allows offsetting of pawn positions Symmetry axis toggle for the more complex puzzles Undo button allows you to undo moves Relaxing soundtrack and sound effects",
