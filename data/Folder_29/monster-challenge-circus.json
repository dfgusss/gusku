You have slain and devoured your brothers because they lacked courage in the face of the mysterious Evil that decimated your universe. Bravely fighting him in your fortress temple, you gradually lost your mind, and in a moment of lucidity you took your own life. Your body and soul drifted through the spirals of time, going back to the origin of everything. When you woke up in the temple of Evil, you felt your hate towards this Evil hadn’t faded. You will have to follow an initiatory course that will lead you to confront this Evil, guided by your father and mentor Gommend. Will you really keep the promise you made to yourself? Features: - An anguishing atmosphere for a real gaming experience. - Game-play: access to powers never seen before - Full-3D universe with dynamic cameras - Two game modes: Arena where you fight incessant waves of monsters or Adventure where you evolve in a storyline mixing action and adventure. - Duration goes from 3 to 4 hours",
