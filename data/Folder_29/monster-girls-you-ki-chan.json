Before you know it, the human world has been taken over by the monster army of the demon world. There was only one thing left, a small island nation of god in the far east. The You-ki had reflected on the cruel battle he had once fought and had vowed never to do it again. But now, the You-ki has decided to fight one more cruel battle to save the human world.
