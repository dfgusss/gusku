    "About the game": "Not Their Will is a Top-Down Shooter in which you control an alien capable of controlling the abilities of the enemies and using them against them. Your objective is to destroy the humans that are shattering your home planet extracting the powerful crystals there are buried deep in it. CHARACTER The alien you control is eager for revenge, which he will achieve by killing the humans he meets along the way. By itself it is very weak, so you will need to use the weapons of the enemies to be able to kill them, getting on them to shoot each other, throwing explosives at them, electrocuting them, bouncing their bullets... or just eating their heads. LEVELS Take revenge on humans in the two areas offered by the video game: The Caves: A dark place home to aliens full of shadows and dangers to humans. The Labs: Human facilities built to maximize the resources extracted from the planet and establish a security perimeter. ENEMIES Fight 10 different human enemies, with unique guns and abilities: Pistol Shotgun Machinegun Flamethrower Sniper Meathead Shocker Shield Acid Healer Mechanical enemies are no exception, so you will encounter 3 of them: Turret Bomber Railgun Will you be ready to face the bosses that await you at the end of each level?",
