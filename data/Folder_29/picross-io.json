    "About the game": "Picross is a picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of '4 8 3' would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive groups. Picross includes: - 15 puzzles 5x5 size - 74 puzzles 10x10 size - 224 puzzles 15x15 size",
