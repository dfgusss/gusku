In a burst of electromagnetic energy, the entire planet Earth disappeared, leaving its gravity well and the moon behind. In this open world, sci-fi role-playing game, you are part of the Moon base team on a desperate mission to bring Earth back. You must assemble and equip your crew, customize your ship and set out in search of unique parts to create the Centauri Drive, a device your team hopes will reverse the electromagnetic phenomenon that swallowed Earth. Travel between dozens of stars, harvest resources to repair and upgrade your equipment, meet and negotiate with friendly (and hostile) aliens, and do whatever it takes to stay alive and bring Earth back. Planet’s Edge features: An open-ended story driven by the player Dynamic, real-time spaceship combat Mining, trading and puzzle solving Turn-based ground combat Customize and upgrade your ship for any situation Select your crew (or clone a new one) and equip them for success",
