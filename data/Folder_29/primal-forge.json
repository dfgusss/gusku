    "About the game": "If you are considering purchasing! I am currently a single passionate developer working on this project. The team size may increase in the future, but please know that future developments may take some time to work out potential flaws or bugs! Having said that, your feedback is very important to me and to the development of this game. Thank you for your consideration, now onto the features list! Adventure? Exploration? Combat &amp; Crafting! Primal Forge is a light-weight action role-playing game with an emphasis in combat and crafting. Unlike other RPG's, Primal Forge features an involved crafting and skill system that encourages players to explore the world, fighting new enemies and finding resources to develop their combat capabilities! Travel through several zones to face unique foes and collect rare crafting reagents to build the strongest equipment in the game. Optimize your performance by selecting your weaponry based on the engagement! Features (As of Early Access (4/30)): Rapid-Class Customization! Determine your loadout for a fight based on the weapons you choose and the skills available to you! 20+ Unique skills to level, each providing a specific purpose for character development! 36+ Combat abilities tied to six combat patterns, providing optimal purposes against different enemies or encounters! 2+ Bosses with independent mechanics and challenges to overcome! Early Access Notes New developments for additional zones, skills, crafting designs, and enemies are built in such a way that new features should be relatively rapid to release. The game currently features a very barebones structure that can be iterated on and updated regularly. Please wishlist today!",
