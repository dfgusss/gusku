    "About the game": "Embark on a tale of conquest in Quinterra! Battle across 5 unique domains in a strategy tactics game like no other. We’ve taken inspiration from tabletop games, roguelikes, and our favorite tactics games to create a brand new experience ripe for exploration. Outfit your army aboard your airship, then upgrade them mid-combat using our unique drafting mechanic! Features Build YOUR army: Choose Elites, Minions, Equipment, and Crystals you wish to bring into battle. Plan accordingly or you may fail your expedition from losing too much morale! 5 Playable Species: Choose from the headstrong Lycans, the tricksy Imps, the durable Crystalians, the knowledgeable Ethereals, or the industrious Clockworks. Long-term Progression: Unlock species, units, talents, loadouts, and difficulty modifiers to enhance your experience across multiple runs! Procedurally Generated: Random rewards, procedurally generated maps, and random enemies create a varied and dynamic experience through each expedition and each combat encounter.",
