    "About the game": "General: There is no more day and night for you, time has stopped for you. You didn't come into this world by accident... Here you will have to see all your fears and experiences without the help of parents or friends. You are alone and your goal is to reach the light that will free you from the 'world of shadows' or doom you! Two worlds: You live in two worlds, and if you die in this world, don't expect mercy in the real world. Remember that they are waiting for you and want to see you alive. Game mode: This is a game of mystical horror in 2D, in which you need to pass story traps, riddles to run and hide from opponents, and much more.... You will have to be careful, because at any moment something inexplicable can happen. You need to get out of this nightmare and get to the light. You will visit the house of nightmares, which is less and less reminiscent of what once was life here. Gloomy trees and abandoned houses surround the God-forsaken land, as well as this old hospital that calls you. The main character does not understand what is happening and tries to find answers — where am I? Who am I? Why am I here? And in the end, you will get all the answers.",
