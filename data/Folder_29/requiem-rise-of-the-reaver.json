    "About the game": "Requiem: Rise of the Reaver is a Free-to-Play, massively multiplayer online role playing game set in a dark distant world where an event known as the 'Thanatos Incident' rendered the world almost unlivable. Create your own biological weapon known as a Temperion and experience the horrors that grip Ethergia. Fight alongside the Fenrir Canine and the Holy Xenon Empire to against the darkness that encroaches on the remnants of civilized society. Key Features Choose between PvP and PvE servers to experience the game your way. Chose amongst 4 distinct different races with their own unique classes. Experience the power of your Temperion by mutilating and utterly evaporating your opponents with gorey detail. Explore Ethergia: walk the streets of Nova Lux, the desolate wastes of Numaren during the light of day or the blackness of the nightmare hours.",
