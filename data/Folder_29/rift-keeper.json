    "About the game": "Embark on your journey, travel through rifts and restore the balance as the Rift Keeper in this handcrafted 2D roguelite platformer with challenging, fast-paced action gameplay. Duty called and the Rift Keeper woke up from his deep slumber. The little town he was summoned was silent as if it's the end. He opened the church's rusty old door and four old men wearing red robes greeted him with a grim smile. One of the priests stepped forward and said, 'The Gates are open'. Embark on your journey , travel through 30 different dungeons! Grow powerful as enemies keep getting harder. How far can you go? Loot epic gear as you progress through the dungeons. Find new weapons and accessories, grow your power! Unique enemies to fight with and many more to come! 30 handcrafted dungeons! Hey! Rift Keeper is our second project. We developed and released Firewood, our first title in 2017. Under the name of Frymore we are just two friends who always have a big desire to improve ourselves and our games. Rift Keeper was a big step for us. Hope you have a wonderful journey!",
