    "About the game": "Shadows is a puzzle-based platformer taking place in a mysterious, silhouetted world. Your goal is to construct a beacon of light to call for help and find your way home. Along the way, you will be able to discover pieces of your past, memories lost after your arrival in the caves. Fireflies will be your guiding light; without them you will enter into the darkness of the caves never to return. As you make your way through the perilous caves, you’ll overcome mysterious runic riddles, discover hidden pathways, and navigate twisted mazes to find freedom. Your endeavors will be two-fold: Not only will you gather the items needed to construct a beacon to call for help, you will also uncover the dark memories of how you arrived here. Yet, the decision to actually make this beacon or even seek out your past is your own; you can choose to find your way out of the caverns or to start a new life underground by following either of the two paths to the end of your journey. Who are you? What will you do when you know the truth? Features: -Six cave regions (each with a multitude of levels) -Various puzzles in each region (from runic riddles to navigating darkness) -Hidden memories that reveal the story -Challenging, spike-filled caverns -Elegant music and graphical design -Two possible endings",
