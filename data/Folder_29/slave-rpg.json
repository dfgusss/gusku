    "About the game": "Slave RPG is a role playing game that takes aspects of classic CRPGs and presents them in a familiar yet modern way. It is a dystopian game that finds the player under the control of an aggressive militia in a distant future, where the housing market crash had a much larger effect on the world. You are a slave and you will need to find ways to make money to escape debt bondage, in order to return to living a normal life. Along your journey, you could possibly gain workers of your own to financially ensure your future. However, you may also find fame and fortune fighting in the district arena. The choice is ultimately yours. FEATURES In-Depth Role Playing Having six different races to choose from, eight default classes, the support for custom class creation, 40 different perks, and a plethora of difficulty options, each character created is truly unique. A dynamic character status system also changes depending on how much damage each individual body part has taken, and gameplay elements will be affected by this status. Classic d20 Based Gameplay Both enemy and player stats alike are affected by a traditionally styled d20 system, with rolls having bonuses based on core stat elements, and various in-game actions taken with d20 die rolls. A Range Of Difficulty Whether you would like the game to be a breeze or want the game to punish you for every action taken, there are plenty of difficulty options to choose from, including: play time, companion deaths, enemy difficulty, weather difficulty, world difficulty, an iron man mode, and more! An Expansive Mid-Texas With over 17 unique places to explore, the post-apocalypse has covered this land in harsh swamp. Here, you can expect to find various gambling dens, a massive arena to fight in, suicide booths for when things get too tough, numerous areas changing depending on the playthrough, and a basic plot to tie it all together without bogging everything down. Plenty Of Extras Various post game content mixed in with some rogue-lite elements provides new content to be unlocked with every ending (or death) achieved. Additional extras include: achievements, cheat codes, secrets, new classes, new races, and unlockable characters.",
