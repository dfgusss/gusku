    "About the game": "100 Players are fighting in a huge battle area and you are one of them. You have to keep your goal clear to survive. At the same time you should try to shoot as many goals as possible to eliminate as many enemies as possible. Only the last man standing will be the winner of the complete round. During this round the circle of goals becomes constantly smaller to keep the action and thrill high. Your potential enemies have several strategies to become the best player. Try to find out what they are doing and beat them with their own weapons. There are several difficulty levels to start easy and slowly become a real master. The magic of the game is handling the struggle to rush forward to beat all you competitors and be defensive at the same time so that you do not give your enemies a weak spot by an open goal. You as your only teammate are a combination of the goalie and striker. This game was a submission to the game jam ludum dare 41. The theme of the game jam was “combine two incompatible genres”. This variant contains: =&gt; Single Player (different. Challenges) =&gt; Multiplayer =&gt; Gamemodes: Classic, Football, Bomb =&gt; Powerups: Frostgun, GravityGun, Speed, Bricks, Protector",
