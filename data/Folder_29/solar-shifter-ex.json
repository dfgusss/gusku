Their only goal is to collect enough resources to be able to leave the solar system. FEATURES • Unique 'shifting' mechanic to bring a completely new level of depth into a shmup • 18 tough missions • 8 beautiful environments • Over 40 enemy types encountered throughout the game • Upgrade your ship • 4 controllable ships: One main ship and three alien ships.
