    "About the game": "Single or Local Co-Op physics-based game with six distinct stages developing a simple premise: As the decaying world challenges you, don't fall! Six Distinct Stages RocketX: Keep your rocket platform in the air and off the ground lava by refueling it with the parachuting fuel crates. Reach space 🚀 Hex Elevator: As the lava keeps rising, the only way up is through elevators which only go up when everyone has completed their prompts and are ready to go up. Beatmill: The beat dictates the rhythm of the prompts along the crisscross treadmills. Hit them on time, or they will fall. Venom Rig: Pillars are destroyed when their respective button is pressed, and rockets land to decay the platform. Avoid platform collapse. Unfair Fair: A moody revolving wheel filled with ever spawning decay balloons. Big Giant Head: Your final nemesis. Features: Move, Jump, Dash and Stomp are your tools. Use them to skillfully survive, help your teammates, confront enemies and interact with the world. Unlock the next stages and move on, or keep playing to improve your highscore. Support for a very wide range of gamepads (although not required, playing with a gamepad is recommended ❤️) Up to two players can use the keyboard to play simultaneously.",
