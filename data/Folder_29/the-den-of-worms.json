    "About the game": "The Den of Worms is an open world RPG/gardening/exploration game where you must enter the Astral Plane on an esoteric quest to save your dreams from being eaten . On your way you will grow plants, hatch worm eggs, restore the life to towns, battle monsters, and uncover secrets. The game features 5 towns, an Underworld, customizable spells, a persistent open world, 40+ different quests, 20+ different wearable items, with mechanics inspired by numerous different genres. Two difficulty modes, 'Explorer' and 'Gamer', to cater to two different styles of play. If you pick 'Gamer', be prepared to scrounge for resources as brutal enemy monsters will attack you when you approach them. If you pick 'Explorer', most enemies will ignore you, allowing you to freely explore the Astral Plane and uncover its secrets. The towns you discover have been overgrown by a terrible parasite. To recover the towns, you must hatch Worm eggs. The worms will clean the towns of rot. The gameworld uses a 'flower based' economy, and to upgrade gear, hatch worm eggs, and finish quests, you must grow a variety of different plants, and clean up litter. By exploring and by growing plants you may discover runes which increase your stats, making your character more durable, powerful, and capable of exploring all the world has to offer. To make your way through this sometimes maze-like world, you must pay close attention to what the NPCs have to tell you.",
