    "Release date": "Jul 2, 2021",
    "About the game": "This is a short slice-of-life visual novel about an average guy spending an afternoon hanging out with his girlfriend Carthaginia, [former] Eternal Dread Empress of Samhain, [retired] Nation-eater, and Immortal Lich, presently on parole for charges of attempted inter-dimensional conquest, raising a skeleton army without a permit, and disturbing the peace... he did always have a thing for powerful, assertive, older women. Since Carthaginia's nation conquering days seem to be behind her, you'll just be watching TV with her, helping her with tech support, and *ahem* 'getting busy.' This is a pretty straightforward visual novel so don't expect much of that fancy 'gameplay' stuff. Just a lot of words to read, a few choices to make and some boobs (and ribages!) to ogle.",
