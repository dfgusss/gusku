    "About the game": "Get into the Christmas spirit with the world’s biggest goblin in a blast from the past, 2D arcade shoot 'em up. Fight evil pet pinetrees from Siberia. Air-battle on a deadly pooping Rudolf. Float around in space and much much more crazy stuff. Play through the whole adventure locally with a friend Unique weapons and power-ups (like shots that grow and shrink) The Giant Goblin will comment on if he thinks you control him well or badly Shoot an innocent bird just because you are a jerk Don’t forget the deadly pooping reindeer 'If you’re after a festive, arcade shooter that truly challenges all that play, then look no future than The Night Christmas Ended. It’s cheaper than a selection box, it’s fun to play and it’s easy to get the hang of it, and its ludicrous characters, daft plot and foul language makes it a game that really has to be seen to be believed.' 7/10 - Invision Community",
