    "About the game": "You are a night fisherman. You are smuggling goods into England. You spot a boat approaching. The man on the boat has a shotgun slung across his back. What do you do? The English Protection Group keep a watchful eye on the Smuggler's Run, a renowned crossing for vessels bound from Calais containing illegal immigrants. When faced with an armed man, his voracious appetite for conversation, and nobody else for miles, can you safely get rid of him? This is a single, film-like scene. You direct the fisherman's actions, as well as directing the camera shots between the cinematic angles available. FEATURES Intense maritime story set in the English channel. Choose your fate: will you get out of this alive? Cinematic experience where you direct the camera. Surging orchestral soundtrack by Richard Campbell. A reinterpretation of one of cinema's greatest scenes (from Inglorious Basterds). Roughly 5-10 minutes in length.",
