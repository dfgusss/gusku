    "About the game": "The Soldiers Factory is a top-down stealth game and the start of a trilogy. Go undetected and sneak past enemy soldiers or secretly kill them. Overcome surveillance cameras and laser barricades. Use the room scanner, the taser pistol and many other weapons. But remember, the alarm will make the mission even more difficult. The playing time on the NORMAL level of difficulty is approximately 12 hours. Of course, it depends on the player. The story takes you to several locations, which is divided into over 60 levels. The game offers 4 levels of difficulty. Including a hardcore mode that is unlocked when the story is finished. In Hardcore mode, every hit the player takes is instantly fatal. Even after you have finished the story, the game still offers a lot of long-term motivation, where the playing time can be extended up to 30 hours. For example: - Collect all the microcomputers and receive a special item, such as an enemy uniform. There is a different special item at each difficulty level. - Complete the secret scavenger hunt and get rewards, such as a secret key that opens a locked door in the game. - Complete the HARDCORE mode History: The Sallantica government has lost control of the SF-32. Sebb Linus, a former TLH agent, is called back on duty. Its mission is to find out what's going on. What sounds like a simple and clichéd infiltration mission will turn out to be much more complex as the game progresses. Follow in the footsteps of Sebb Linus and experience an exciting story with many unpredictable twists and turns. This mission will completely change the worldview of the protagonist, where some philosophical topics are also dealt with. 'The Soldiers Factoy' takes place in an alternative timeline to our world.
