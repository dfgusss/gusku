    "About the game": "When a person becomes too lazy to work, they will try to simplify even the smallest task. Mankind invented Them - to simplify your life. Mechanoids to perform all of our mundane activities which finally completely replaced humans in the workspace. Creating the perfect workers turned out to be a mistake. This mistake cost the lives of more than 80% of the colonized population on Mars. The mechanoids went out of control - they killed everything that moved. For some time mechanoids held on Mars planet, they have changed a lot. Now most of the planet surrounded by rocks. Dust soars and is driven into the air . . . The mechanoids become covered with stone chips. They begin to build their structures, their hives. The Hives transform the soil into a more useful resource for mechanoids - stone. With this stone, they begin to build their world. Some of the humans from the colony survive. It's time to rise up to defeat what we have created! Features: Large opened Martian Colony Extensive system of skills Choice of characters Many types of weapons",
