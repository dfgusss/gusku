    "About the game": "Thank you for showing interest in my game. This game is a text-based game with no visual graphics or pictures, made in python and closes by itself when you lose or win, it is a great time killer. This game will test how strong your ability to recall things is. You will be asked to go through different areas with making sure you don't go into an area with the 'Evil King', where you will lose the game. Try to beat the time counter and get the quickest time too. It's fun for all ages that know how to read and type.",
