VIDEOBALL is a compact expression of all sports' mechanics. Use either analog stick or the directional buttons to maneuver. Use any button or trigger to project a triangle. Only triangles can displace balls. Hold your button or trigger to charge a bigger triangle. Bigger triangles push harder. Stun opponents or cancel triangles with other triangles. Push balls into the opposing goal to score points. Score more points in order to win. Win in order to Feel Real Good. Features : Online: Compete in exhibition or ranked VIDEOBALL in solo or team modes. Customizable: Various arenas, color palettes, music tracks, and backgrounds. Local: Adjust ball count, time limit, and point values to design your own rule set. You are already a VIDEOBALL character: VIDEOBALL is part of Earth; VIDEOBALL is happening right now.
