    "About the game": "Setting: Walkerman is a Visual Novel about a boy who embarks upon a career in monster hunting. As a walkerman, he will hunt a breed of supernatural creatures with only one weakness: their rules. Each creature obeys its own unique set of rules, such as being unable to cross over salt or pass before mirrors. And it's only by entrapping these creatures within their rules that walkermen can hope to defeat them. Each act of Walkerman centers around one such creature, and the process of investigating it. Players must study their quarry, gather any necessary items, and then confront it in battle. Attention to detail and clever usage of items will determine whether the player completes the contract, or is taken by the night. Gameplay: Most of the game takes place in a Visual Novel format. The player assumes the role of Jorgen, a young walkerman who's recently arrived in the city of Midgard. Throughout the Visual Novel sections of Walkerman , players will guide Jorgen through his investigations--as well as his personal troubles. Decisions the players make can have drastic outcomes on Jorgen's life, both in and out of combat. Combat gameplay takes place on an isometric, pseudo-board game. The player selects actions from a list of options, including movement, item usage, or split-second decisions. Each combat sequence has multiple solutions, dependent on the player's item collection and knowledge of their quarry. Acts: Prologue: The Thing in the Weald Jorgen, a nineteen year-old serf, has just embarked upon a peculiar career: monster hunting. As a walkerman, he will tour the streets and alleyways at night, battling supernatural creatures that emerge when the sun goes down. But before he can reach the city-state of Midgard, a chance encounter will send him spiraling headlong into a world beyond light and reason... Out Now Act 1: Welcome to Midgard Jorgen's arrival in Midgard is marked by suspicious characters, perilous nights, and the all-pervading smell of a civilization in decay. Both ostracized and incensed by his countrymen, he raises his standard in the world's loneliest revolution... Out Now Act 2: Herdchaser-girl Jorgen has survived his first contract, but now finds himself trapped between the circumstances of his family, religion, and trade. Hounded by their demands—and another more sinister offer—the young walkerman soon finds assistance in the most unlikely of allies... Out Now Act 3: Theories Surfeited by his surroundings and disillusioned with his trade, Jorgen seeks a new path forward for himself and Midgard. The city-state hosts a few theory-peddlers ready to provide just that, but their medicine might prove worse than the sickness... Coming at Some Point Features: Over a dozen beautiful illustrations Dozens of unique and fully illustrated characters Branching story dependent on player agency Five lengthy installments with instances of abstract, description-based puzzle solving Pseudo-Board Game aesthetic for battle sequences An extensive soundtrack featuring new tracks every episode An extras menu featuring a CG gallery and music room BE WARNED: Walkerman may feature themes and imagery of a violent, disturbing, or sexual nature, and is unsuitable for small children.",
