    "Release date": "Oct 28, 2021",
    "About the game": "Use various props on the map to solve the puzzle, escape from the sky under the hands of murderers, and experience the excitement that can't be escaped in the checkpoints based on various well-known films. If you were in a horror movie, would you survive? Play multiple roles in various classic horror films. Trying to survive in horror movies by decrypting and fighting. The game tells that on a street, players watch all kinds of horror films in the cinema that only shows horror films. In the game, players will take turns to play multiple roles and look for survival opportunities in levels designed according to various horror films. I like the game Lakeview Cabin Collection very much, so I found the author Roope Tamminen and made the game with his consent and support. The game will contain at least seven main levels and will not sell DLC. *The game currently has two complete levels, and other levels are still under production",
