    "About the game": "You're Not Special is a (mostly) non-combat, choices-matter, puzzle-based RPG. There are great forces set to doom the small kingdom in which you live and only the chosen one can stop them. The problem is, you're not the chosen one. Features: - Choices that radically shape the outcome of the game leading to seven different game endings - Unique and challenging puzzles coupled with new takes on classic puzzles - An original score by Lighting Nights - Exploration, rich dialogue, and choices-driven narrative - A one-life mode for super hardcore peeps - Non heavy-handed lore that is woven into the story, bits at a time You are just a peasant. You were never born for greatness. And yet, for some reason fate has woven you into the company of The Chosen One. Will you help The Chosen One fulfill his destiny? Or will you keep quietly to yourself in town? The choices (and their lasting consequences) are yours to make! ________________________________________________________________________________________ NOTE: If you receive this error upon startup: 'Your profile cannot be used because it is from a newer version of NW.js,' note that you can still play the game and the error is harmless (it simply comes from you having a newer version of software that this game uses). However, if you would like to fix the error (mega annoying, right?), please follow the following steps: On Windows 10, this would be in Users &gt; Your User Name &gt; App Data &gt; Local. Find the folder labeled 'nwjs' and delete it. Then, go to the folder Users &gt; Your User Name &gt; App Data &gt; Local &gt; User Data &gt; Default and delete the two files 'Web Data' and 'Web Data-journal.' The folder and files will be repopulated when you start the game and the error message should be gone! On Mac, navigate to Your User Name &gt; Library &gt; Application Support and delete the folder labeled 'nwjs.' Then, go to the folder Your User Name &gt; Library &gt; Application Support &gt; Default and delete the two files 'Web Data' and 'Web Data-journal.' The folder and files will be repopulated when you start the game and the error message should be gone!
