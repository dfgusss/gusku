    "About the game": "Like the song says, good guys finish last, and in this case, they also finish homeless and on fire. Join up with Bob our local Necromancer and his cohort of evil buddies to raise some proverbial and literal hell across the kingdom of... Good... land... Goodlandia... yeah, that's what we're going with. Use all your evilitude to ruin these poor fella's day and tap your way to become the baddest of all the badasses in your corner of the fiery pit of clicker hell. And if you think that doing that isn't evil enough, how about some corporate management abuse? Con your zombies and monsters into doing your work for you so you can sit back and reap the reward of their labor, idle game style. Features • Various evil baddies to help you on your quest of not being a nice guy. • Gallons of skills to enable the ultimatest, deadliest sin: utter slothing. • Hordes of peaceful people to annoy and bully around. • Lots of towns to pillage and plunder for some phat loots. • Purchase some subterranean real-estate without filing the paperwork; yolo. • Enjoy new content twice a month, almost, basically whenever we stop being lazy. • Already an established troublemaker? You can import your progress and play on desktop with our cross platform technology! • Play in most language known to man, including Hodor",
