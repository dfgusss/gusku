    "About the game": "ZS Online is a top-down 2D shooting multiplayer game that you can enjoy in less than 10 to 16 minutes. Pick up the materials during the day, and make the weapons and items you want! At night, the view becomes narrow and zombies come out. The number of zombies increases every day, and poisonous gases hit the city. Players can pick up materials scattered across various buildings in the city. You can harvest trees and fruits. The map shows the position of the other player, and if you enter the house, you will not be able to see the opponent. Hunger decreases, and the faster you move, the faster you decrease. When hunger reaches zero, your stamina decreases, and you can eat food to make up for it. You can combine the ingredients to make weapons, such as knives and guns, or throw tools, armor, and food. It gets dark at night, and the view is limited, and zombies come out. You will also lose sight of other players on the map. As the days go by, the number of zombies increases, and poison gas hits the city. If there is only one player left on the map, you will win. Choose a character with multiple abilities and play it. You can also play by yourself without the Internet. In this case, zombies come out during the day, and more. Also, poison gas does not hit the city and scores points.",
