    "About the game": "What's a Swordsman to do after his family is ripped away from him? Kill the ones who did it with the power of the Virtues of course. It's not like the Virtues were helping people anyway. With the help of Sin, what could go wrong? Using different swords and attacks, battle monsters, join up with characters, and use the powers of the Virtues to find vengeance. Move in a rotation from Front, Middle, to Back during each fight in this turn based strategy game. The different positions allow for different attacks. Each character has their own abilities, weapons, and stats. The constant revolving order of players and enemies during a fight provides a unique twist on the classic RPG style.",
