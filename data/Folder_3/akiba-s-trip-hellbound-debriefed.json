    "Release date": "Jul 20, 2021",
    "About the game": "Supernatural creatures are stalking the pop culture mecca of Akihabara—and you know that because they've turned you into one of them. Their only weakness, and yours, is sunlight, which means there's only one way to stop them: call them out on the streets, knock their clothes off, and expose their skin before they can do it to you. Arm yourself with a rolled-up poster, a guitar, a laptop, a magical girl wand, or (if you insist) an actual weapon, then hit Akihabara's colorful streets. Browse recreations of real-life shops circa 2011, mingle with Akiba's residents and tourists, and discover the town's many secrets. Will you work with the secret paranormal-hunting agency, give the creatures a fair shake (hey, some of them seem all right), or just look out for your otaku friends? Choose your side, choose your missions, and enjoy a freewheeling adventure with AKIBA'S TRIP: Hellbound &amp; Debriefed. Key Features Playful Reimagining of Japan’s Electronics Mecca Take a virtual tour of 2011’s Akihabara district recreated in painstaking detail, complete with accurate street layouts and shops based on real businesses operating at the time. Fight Like a Nerd Wield an arsenal of replicas, collectibles, and other amusing objects as you humiliate vampires into submission in this playful twist on the 3D beat 'em up genre, all while wearing a stylish array of customizable clothes and costumes. Your Choices Matter Choose which faction to support in the fight for Akihabara and watch as your decisions affect the course of the story, culminating in one of several different endings. Full Dual Audio Enjoy hours of voiced-over banter in your choice of English or the original Japanese.",
