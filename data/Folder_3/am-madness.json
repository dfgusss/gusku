    "About the game": "Your Omega protection has been stolen. Attempt to escape the first signs of madness, in a hard, unforgiving, 2D platformer. Inspired by classics such as Manic Miner and Jet Set Willy , with a modern twist. Face the darkness, escape The Madness. Facing The Madness Completing each difficulty level (Easy, Normal and Madness) in order will unlock power-ups that will help you with the next difficulty. Along the way you will earn the ability to use shields and even see helpful echos from the past... But it's likely you will still fail. Beating The Madness and reaching the 'true ending' is the ultimate goal, but it is rare anyone ever truly escapes madness... Somewhere within, the true story of Ma Sadness hides from you, the pleasure of standing around in the rain is rewarded, the guilt of cheating your way through is just six keys away, and the exhilaration of beating something harder than Darkeater Midir awaits you. Features: Easy Difficulty - Face The Madness with the help of a single use, always on shield. It will make things a little easier.... Normal Difficulty - Face The Madness with three lives and escape both normal and dark curse level variations Madness Difficulty - Face The True Madness with just one life. Play through The Madness level variations and DIE Three types of visors to unlock. The first will allow you to activate a shield, the second will let you see past echos, and the third will allow you to reach the true ending Hidden levels and hidden paths Three display modes - Retro, Clean, Neon Glow (one may help you with some levels!) Soundtrack by 'Last Child Left' 8 achievements that give true bragging rights!",
