    "About the game": "Occult Practice In the world of Sartova this practice is used to evoke angelic beings, gods, and other intelligences related to souls, elements, the Themes, night terrors, disembodied voices, and even things older than the gods themselves... Through this practice, Apollyon , one may speak with them, make deals for power, capture them, or even project one's soul from their body entirely. The table can provide all of this, and it is all dangerous. Themes Apollyon can be considered a multiplayer choose-your-own adventure RPG, a roguelite, a strategy board game, and simply a story to enjoy . It is a narrative that develops with you, both in small arcs and large stories for character and table alike. Your choices will matter , but it is also forgiving, for while you can die, another practitioner may continue use of the table, and keep the tradition going, or even others at your very table! Characters There are ten characters to play, each with their own personal stories , which can be progressed in single or multiplayer! These will advance the character's skills and abilities, and generally make it easier and even possible, in some cases, to complete tougher Intentions , which are akin to quests and goals in Apollyon. Gameplay and Unlocks One will utilize obsidian tokens upon the Apollyic table to control various powers, and where they lie upon the table will influence the power in that direction, summoning or banishing spirits who favor said power. Spirits that approach the table must be dealt with, through violence, invocation, treaties, deception, or many other ways, also influenced by the tokens. You can also invoke spirits of your own, some of which you may bring between rituals , as well as other items to aide in the ritual, such as the Chronometer to keep time sane while projecting into the spirit world, or a brave ally who can aide you during the ritual. Additionally, Apollyon can be played with up to two friends , who will share the table's alignment, but will take on the burden or benefit of each spirit that approaches the table alone! This creates a unique strategy only present in multiplayer . Post-Release Apollyon is a narrative story that will shape with your choices, comprising 400,000+ words, but the final arcs of the main story and the individual character stories will come in frequent (weekly to bi-weekly) updates. These will be free of charge to those that purchase Apollyon! Additionally, player-made stories and spirits can be created, and even used in multiplayer, which will add to post-release content!
