    "About the game": "BLEWIE was created and programmed by a 1 man team out of a sheer love of puzzle and platform games. Help BLEWIE escape the FUN-HOUSE by bringing the BLUE STONE to the BLUE PLATFORM. Control BLEWIE, push the RED and BLUE STONES to build bridges. Use the YELLOW KEY STONE to unlock the YELLOW LOCK BLOCKS. RED STONES are disposable. After you are finished with them, you can crush them. After the YELLOW KEY STONE has unlocked the gate, it too becomes disposable and can be crushed. Crush the enemies with STONES for extra hearts to refill your life. Gain an extra life after every level you complete. Watch out for the different enemies, they each have different patterns. Some will even try to chase you. If that is enough to worry about, watch out for enemy objects such as slamming weights, cutting-edge axes, death spikes, acid, crazy saws and bloody tears.
