You don't participate in society - or whatever's left of it. You're fine with being alone. But when a young woman appears on your secluded property, injured and lost on a stormy night, you're understandably torn. Are you obligated to help her? Is it even safe to help her? You have no idea what to do. Your brain is mush. And the fact that she's so pretty doesn't help... Cabin Fever is a sweet, funny, romantic visual novel that's sure to give you all the feels. Experience a budding friendship - and a blossoming romance - as you open up, make choices, and explore multiple endings. The world may seem bitter and bleak… But your story doesn't have to be.
