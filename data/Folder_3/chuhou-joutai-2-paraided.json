    "About the game": "The true strength of The Real Driller is his wisdom. A few months have passed since Frederic Sam Fawkes' fall. Has his soul returned from the Netherworld? Now, a curse has struck Kozankyo and SPASDOT wants Kozan's beloved Crown Princess to vanish. Should it happen, SPASDOT will plague Kozan through communist domination. Hope will rest on the Kozanese Royal Defense Force recruits Susumu Takajima and Kagami Ochiai, who are now searching for an ancient relic for the Crown Princess, but SPASDOT wants to make them die trying. Your ultimate strength can't come from your might, but your mind. Chuhou Joutai is back for a whole new adventure. You won't be exploring just Kozankyo, but nearby cities as well. The new swaths of danmaku will challenge your reflexes to another level. New enemies, including mythical creatures and Crimsonite types are also here to challenge you as well. Need something to get or to take a breather? Just go to a convenience store or dine out at a sushi bar to see what they offer. If you fail to collect the newtons or ingots from thumped foes, you won't receive clues from the townsfolk for ways to confront the Scarlet Devil again. Features Retro-style graphics influenced by the golden era of arcade games Two playable characters with an amazing two-player mode Simplified gameplay for newcomers, as well as easy to learn and intuitive controls Hilarious dialogue with a new and improved art style",
