    "About the game": "The Great War has ended, but Europe is still being shaken by the political turmoil. Empires fall, socialist movements rise, new national states emerge on the ruins of the old world. In the very end of the year 1918 the army of Soviet Russia attempts an offensive towards west. Their goal is to spark a communist uprising, that will start from eastern Germany and eventually consume entire Europe. Relive events of the year 1919 and fight through enemy cards in six historical scenarios spanning from December 1918 to January 1920. Developer I have developed Comrades and Barons: Solitaire of Bloody 1919 as my first game. With the exception of music, I have made every aspect of it, including the art. This game is made on GameMaker: Studio 1.4. If you find any bugs in the game, feel free to report them to me. Thank you for reading this and I hope you find my game entertaining and challenging.
