    "About the game": "This game is a puzzle game where you aim to reach the goal by disarming the security devices placed in the field. The security devices include three colors of magic flares and two types of barriers. Magic flares can be extinguished by using orbs of the same color. The barriers can be removed by stepping on the witches on the floor. If you use the wrong order when using the orb to remove the magic flare, you may get stuck. The key to the game is to know where to use the orbs. There is no violence or tragic scenes in this game. It's a refreshing dip for the mind tired of adventure and survival in other games. Enjoy a relaxing time while listening to the fantastic background music! Story Schwarz Dohkai, a doctor of space engineering, was working on a warp engine.
