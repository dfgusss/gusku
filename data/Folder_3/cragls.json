    "About the game": "Cragls is an online multiplayer car racing game with no race tracks. Players race through a square-shaped arena and try to reach the score portal, which jumps to a new location in the arena after each score. This unpredictable gameplay creates an exciting multiplayer experience with frequent and unexpected turns. Boosters, blasters, shields and traps add more spice to the game. Each round takes 5 minutes and in the end the player with the highest score wins.",
