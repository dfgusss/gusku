    "About the game": "cyubeVR (pronounced Cube VR ) is a virtual reality voxel game fully designed for VR. The world in cyubeVR is entirely procedurally generated. Enter a seed or let the game generate one for you, and explore a unique and detailed infinite world that no one ever saw before. Find your way through complex cave networks going deep into the ground, climb up huge hills to get a great view over the world or try to build yourself a way up to massive floating islands. All of that fully optimized for VR to get you the most immersive experience possible. There are no limits how far you can travel – your unique world is infinite in size. Gather resources in the world and use those to build anything you have in mind. Allow your creativity and imagination to run free. Design a fortress on top of a mountain, construct a bridge to connect two floating islands or dig yourself deep into the ground and work on complex underground structures. Experience a building system exclusively optimized for roomscale VR in a way that was never seen before. You can even move blocks after you have placed them! Thanks to roomscale VR, even have a good conscience for the workout you did while you can marvel your new creations. In VR there is no need for any UI, menus or buttons for crafting. Just use your hands and naturally craft tools and other items directly in the world. A FEW SPECIAL FEATURES WORTH MENTIONING: Gravity Gloves! You never have to bend down or move much to reach items or tools - you can easily grab anything using gravity gloves: Dynamic Weather! The weather dynamically and smoothly changes between sunny, rain, and snow. And cyubeVR probably has the best-looking snow of all existing VR games! Great building controls, designed from the ground up for VR! You can mine, collect and charge magic crystals to conveniently place up to 9 blocks at once. Full finger tracking on the controllers that support it (Valve Index Controllers), and the closest possible approximation on other controllers (Touch Controllers, Vive Controllers) The game automatically detects which controller you are using and adjusts the controls to optimally work with your controller , and automatically shows you the tutorial fitting for your exact controller - currently, the game has 4 different control schemes, individually designed for: HTC Vive Controllers Valve Index Controllers Oculus Touch Controllers (Rift, Rift S, Quest, Quest 2) Windows Mixed Reality Controllers Use either Smooth Locomotion or Teleport, depending on what you prefer. For the locomotion, you can choose between controller-oriented and head-oriented Smooth Locomotion. For turning, you can choose between snap turning and smooth turning. Snap turning offers options for either 22.5° steps or 45° steps, while smooth turning allows you to freely adjust the turn speed with a slider. Dynamic Picture Frames that allow you to import any custom PNG/JPG files from your PC and display them in fully resizable and movable picture frames that you can decorate the wall of your virtual house with: Dual Wielding with all tools! Twice as fast, and twice the fun. There's an awesome furnace in the game, fully controled with realistic VR mechanics! No UI interaction. Put combustible items into the lower chamber of the furnace, place items to melt in the upper chamber of the furnace, use flintstones to realistically generate sparks that light up the fire, and watch it operate! You can easily collect items into your inventory using the awesome vacuum bucket that can be enhanced further with magic crystals for an even stronger effect! Blue crystal energy makes the bucket suck, red crystal energy makes the bucket blow. Use sunlight to charge a crystal blue, or use moonlight to charge a crystal red.",
