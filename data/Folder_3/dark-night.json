You can hear their footsteps. You need to move. You have limited visibility. Light a matchstick to see in the dark. Close your eyes. Listen. They’re behind you. The time you have is no longer your own. You need to survive. Start begging for your life. Can you make it? Gameplay Description: You wake up at 1am, woken by strange sounds and stirring shadows. You light matchsticks to help see into the dark, that feels as though it’s engulfing you by the second. The floorboards creak as you walk on them, the silence around you being almost deafening.

You see a lone key sitting on a chair in front of you. As you pick it up however you feel a presence in the dark staring at you, waiting patiently for the right time to strike. You need to keep moving and wind a music box to keep the enemies away, however there is a doll waiting to awake from it's sleep...",
