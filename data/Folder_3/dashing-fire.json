    "About the game": "Dashing Fire is a fast-paced, challenging roguelike! Every area is randomly generated, filled to the brim with unique tiny planets riddled with juicy creatures of all shapes and sizes! You must DASH between these small worlds, diving into fiery hot flames and blasting your way upwards through monsters and clouds, treasure, and ashes! Master the mechanics rather than the levels, since these change with every new playthrough, providing a fresh adventure each time. Over 10+ challenging bosses, 40+ unique and squishy creatures, 10+ powers to upgrade your fiery hero, and 5 drastically different areas. Discover and learn all you can about this universe so that you may bring balance to it. It's designed as a 'pick up and play' experience. With minimalist, engaging gameplay - you can jump in for just a couple minutes, or immerse yourself for hours as you attempt to beat the many challenges on your journey. Enjoy epic, colorful, heart-pounding soundtracks by Dave Allen while you try and become the next Sun. The entire world of Dashing Fire, from art and story to gameplay was created by Noa Calice, creator of Blackthornprod, a popular game development Youtube channel!",
