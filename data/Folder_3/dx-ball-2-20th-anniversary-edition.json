Seumas McNally's fan-favourite DX-Ball 2 has been re-mastered for modern PCs while retaining all of the classic brick-breaking action and unique graphic style of the late 90's original. Features: 150 Boards from the original Board Pack 1 (aka Full Version) plus the all-new anniversary boardset and widescreen variants. New dynamic animated boards change as you play! Switch between new high-res board textures or the original 90's graphics at any time. 20 classic power-ups plus the all-new gravity-ball, lightning and more! Shoot the ball extra fast to instantly break multi-hit bricks with the new punch paddle! Move the ball from a distance with the gravity push/pull paddle. Saved games allow you to save your progress and continue later. Compete for the best score with new online leaderboards. Includes editing tools and full workshop support for creating and sharing custom boardsets with the community. Collect in-game charms for extra points and achievements. Play in 'Classic' mode with only the original features and graphics.",
