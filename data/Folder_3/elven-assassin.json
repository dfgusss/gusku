    "About the game": "Should I join? Is there anything more epic than slaying hordes of orcs with a bow in Virtual Reality? When nothing comes to your mind, then you probably should try this. If you thought: 'Of course, slaying them with my friends online in co-op mode!', then this is the matter of destiny. Become an elven assassin. Take a bow and kill hundreds of orcs of different types that want to get into the elven town and destroy it. As an elven assassin, you will make spectacular shots like long distant headshots or you will send lethal arrows through the windows. All this to conquer global leaderboards of other elven assassins. Piece of cake then? Not really. This is real orcs assault. The Orcs are running fast making the game more competitive. They break into houses to hide from your arrows, and when they got furious their massive axe is thrown to splash you head into pieces. Assassin United. Two, Three or Four assassin may unite to defend the town. Use wisely the four available archery spots to survive as long as possible. You can choose one of the public servers, that asks for your support or decide to defend the castle only with the brothers you know on the private server. PvP Deathmatch. For those who would rather test themselves against other players online in a competitive mode, the PvP Deathmatch was introduced. But be careful with this one as there are some extremely skilled archers waiting for a challenge there. VR Parks and Arcades.
