    "About the game": "Endless Burst is a fresh take on the Bullet Hell arcade experience. Challenge your skills and endurance as you fight and dodge your way through overwhelming foes. Customize the way you play with 9 unique and upgradeable classes. Unlock new powerful attacks and challenges as you progress. Procedurally generated enemies, levels, and bosses keep the experience fresh as every new battle is a unique challenge. Select from 9 upgradeable classes, each with a unique play style. Whether you prefer to get up close and personal, snipe your enemies from a distance, or focus on moving around the hail of bullets, there's a class to suit your play style. As you progress, upgrade them to make them stronger, faster, and unlock devastating special attacks. Three game modes are available. The default Mission Mode pits you in large room-based dungeons for you to explore, loot, and hunt the boss. Completing each level is challenging, but securing a victory will reward you with extra rewards and even more formidable foes. Boss Rush allows you to fight progressively more difficult bosses so you can hone your skills in those one-on-one duels. Finally the Custom Challenge mode allows you to face exactly what you want and how you want. On top of choosing the difficulty and size of the level, you can add gameplay modifiers to increase the difficulty in various ways in exchange for better rewards.",
