Are you ready to unlock the secrets of Enemy Mind? 8 levels and 70 waves of challenge Side-scrolling space shooter for PC Classic 8-bit art-style 20+ different ships , each with their own unique power and ability Adaptive story system that changes with your individual play style Multi-player co-op supports up to four players at once Original Chiptune-inspired soundtrack by Rainbow Kitten More Reviews 'It's incredibly addictive!' Indie Retro News March 2014 'The game really is the whole package. GameCola Score: 9 - Excellent' GameCola June 2014 'Overall I was very impressed by what Schell Games was able to achieve with a genre that is not really known for innovation. The game is addictive enough that you will want to complete it a few times in order to piece together the whole story and of course the co-op mode will also eat up a lot of your spare time if you have friends nearby. While shooter fans will obviously enjoy the game the most I urge anyone that has an interest in polished, unique titles to try it out as it is definitely worth the effort. Rating: 8/10' GAMERamble June 2014 'Enemy Mind is an excellent and unique take on the shooter genre. Definitely worth the price at full retail.'
