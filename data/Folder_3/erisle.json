    "About the game": "is an ARPG created with the Unity5 game engine by an independent team. It combines currency and health into the same value to create unique changes in numbers and a brand new gaming experience. We made a bold decision in designing the game’s stats system, where a player’s Shield (powered by energy),Ammunition and in-game currency are all represented by the same number, which is called “Energy” in the game. It absorbs damage taken by the player until it reaches 0. Then, the player will start losing health. Energy is also used as ammunition, as well as a currency for upgrading existing weapons and obtaining new weapons. Players can distribute Energy to their personal styles, such as allocating a large amount to challenge bosses head-on, or take another route, where weapons are upgraded to deal massive damage to bosses, but the bosses can also one shot you. We have also added tons of unique monsters in the ever-changing landscape of the game, such as meandering underground caves or endless plains. They all have unique attribute attacks, which can only be countered by carefully planning and adjusting Energy values.",
