Getting the item is not simple! For example if a customer asks for a rat, you will need to get to the cave and beat up a rat but , to get to the cave you will need to destroy the nets blocking the cave entrance and to do that you will need to find a knife. The game features carry over money that lets you upgrade the cosmetic looks of your pirate dude to show off to your friends and other pirates online.",
