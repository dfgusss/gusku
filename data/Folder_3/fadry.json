    "About the game": "It is 4E 448. A rainy morning. There is a man, walking alone through the monster-infested forests of Midland. He bears only tattered brown rags, an old knife, and a message he was tasked with delivering. In this decaying world, a messenger's work is something to be treasured... Fadry is a story-focused game which explores a dark fantasy world through the eyes of several different characters. Length: about 13 hours. Features: Decisions impacting the story This game is very demanding when it comes to the player's attention. Characters will lie and mislead you. History books are biased. You will need to seek out information on your own initiative and analyze it all carefully before you make your decisions, there will be quite a few of them. No in-game source is infallible. Don't expect complete answers to come to you on a silver platter. A vast fantasy world Fadry is set in a vast world built to create a sense of history and depth . Its many religions, philosophies, factions, scholars, leaders and great warriors have all been written to be dynamic and influence the culture around them, often clashing. As the game's protagonists move through the world, an observant player will not only learn about all of this, but also become a part of it all. Challenging turn-based combat You are not some chosen one. If you want to survive, you'll need to use wit and knowledge to best your opponents. Manual and walkthrough can be found in your install folder.",
