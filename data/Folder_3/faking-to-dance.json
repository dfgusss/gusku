    "About the game": "Faking to Dance is an original song by Breaking Forms, a couple's band based in Boston that mixes powerful vocals and intense sounds. This song is a bizarre adventure with strong percussion and a powerful middle vocal section. The sounds are overlaid over a screaming guitar that pummels the song through insane landscapes. The visuals carry you through lunar mountains, space stations, geometric tunnels, and a swarm of dancing robots that explodes in cubism. At Datawheel we bring you original songs from new artists in unique visual experiences designed to match the mood, speed, and rhythm of every track we release. Lean into the movement.
