Long ago, Nerfelo was once a bountiful and thriving world that has remained at peace for hundreds of years. All was beautiful and intact. Peace and tranquility flourished throughout the land. It was heaven. Unfortunately, that only remained until one day when the great Garfarian Empire came and pillaged the land. In the wake of war, hope was dwindling and all was thought to be lost. The allied Kingdoms of Kessania and Inelda are all that are left to stand in the Garfarian's way. That is, until a rebel group calling themselves the Shelminai emerged. Felm Heisen Felm is the respectable leader of the Shelminai and son of Marclex, a war hero from a shattered past. He seeks to stop the Garian empire and rid the world of injustice all while trying to track down his father's killer. Momo Amoichi Momo is a benevolent Priestess and sister to Felm.
