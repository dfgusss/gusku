    "About the game": "Flippen Run Mike is a 2d, cartoony, platforming game where running and hiding are the only options you have. Every enemy is a 'Boss' and can end your attempt to keep Mike alive in one hit. This game is designed to be difficult and is going to challenge you over and over through trial and error. You need to try and complete the 40 unique levels in eight realms. Find the 'hidden' character in four different stages (pro tip - do not miss one encounter). There is no in-game map stages are maze-like. Also, who has a map of the sewers? Unique storyline. This game might be offensive to some players the content in this game is satire.",
