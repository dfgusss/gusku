    "About the game": "Fly. Deliver. Poop. Dovy has been kidnapped! She was taken to the top of the highest skyscraper in the city. Now you, Chester, have to rescue her. To rescue her, you need to help the people in the city and use the rewards they give you to fix a ventilator so you can fly high enough. Help the people with simple pigeon activities... like delivering messages, helping out with a thing or two and of course... pooping on people and cars! Also, be aware of dangers like cars and the cat that is always patrolling the city. As they can give you some serious hits! But you got this, fly and poop little pigeon! Pigeon mechanics: Fly, eat, poop. Your life bar and poop bar are one. More food, more life but also slower and heavier to fly. Less food, less life but also faster and lighter to fly. Pooping empties your bar, if you poop to much you will die. You can recharge by eating from trash cans or in parks. Hits from cars, people and the cat also empties your bar. Staying on water to much time also empties your bar. There are 7 total quests that include: pooping on people and cars, delivering messages from one character to another, and a couple of challenges like guiding a fireman and passing through 6 hoops on the clouds. You also have to find 3 key cards in the map. The rewards from the quests will help you to fix a ventilator and fly high enough to the rooftop of the skyscrapers. The key cards will help you to open doors and activate other ventilators, so you can 'climb' from one building to another. You do all this to rescue Dovy (the dove princess) who is on the highest building. You can also poop on cars and people just for fun.",
