    "About the game": "We love VR and that's why we are offering this game for free! This game is no longer supported, but if you like this game, please support us and check out our new and improved Ninja Rhythm game that supports custom music: / Futurejam: An Electronic Music Rhythm Game from the year 2049 Features: Playing the unique 'HexaSynth' virtual instrument you'll sound and feel like you're really playing the music. A 5-pad and a 9-note marimba keyboard that will really test how fast you can fling those drumsticks. Miss a beat or note, you'll hear it! Each track is split into different layers, miss a beat and that track gets cut from the mix. Reach out, pick up those sticks and start playing! Licensed tracks from real-life house and trance artists, which we plan to keep expanding during development. Play a track well and you'll be rewarded stars to unlock the next set of tracks. Higher difficulty means more pads and keys to manage and more notes to hit. * S rank - 1 star * B,A rank - 1 star * D,C rank - 1 star Per-track global and local leaderboards allow you to compete against steam players across the world or with your friends in your living room. The bigger your streak, the more accurate your timing, the higher your score. Use the post-game stats review to work out where you can up your game. Hitting those notes too early and missing our on valuable points? * Streak - consecutive note hits. Miss a note and your streak resets to zero. * Accuracy - how many notes in total you managed to hit * Timing - how accurate your hit was to the note. Perfect=3 points, Good=2, Boo=1. * Spam - just hitting the pads hoping you'll hit notes? Bonus points if you're nice and clean with your hits. Having a party? Everyone else gets to watch all the action from the virtual spectator camera flying around the stage, just like watching a music video. Toggle on and off with the spacebar if no-one is watching - it'll improve performance. Each level has its own mix of lights and special effects that react to how good you play. Play well and all the strobes and lasers will be turned up to 11! Screw up and the crowd are going to start booing when the strobes stop blinking. Some Random Accolades 'Futurejam is the perfect combination of EDM, VR and cyberpunk.' - Chris T., Managing Director, Unity3D 'Remember DDR? Well this is the next generation of that! Giving gamers the virtual experience of being on stage.' - Johnny B. Goode, Pyro Top 100 DJ",
