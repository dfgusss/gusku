    "About the game": "No one knew who built the ancient tower that loomed beside the coast. The young girl figured water must have once flowed down its giant aqueducts into her village, but even her grandfather couldn't remember seeing the mill's old water wheel turn. These days it is the job of her and the other children to journey to-and-from the tower to collect what little water bubbles up in the caves beneath it. But everything is about to change when she awakens a mysterious glowing orb buried beneath the puddles. Images long hidden on the cavern walls now glow with hints of a new hope for her drought-stricken village, and the sealed door of the tower sits ajar for the first time in centuries. With her curious companion in tow, the young girl bravely enters the crumbling ruins of the ancient machine to discover if its long-held secrets hold the key to her future. Golem is a heart-warming adventure about a young girl and a shape-shifting golem who must navigate the ruins of an ancient tower to solve its challenging puzzles and re-activate its long-dormant machines. Features: Explore 10 expansive levels, from the caverns deep below the tower to the windswept turrets perched above the surrounding desert. Using the different skills of the girl and the golem, solve the tower's puzzles to navigate the broken ruins and re-activate its long dormant machines. Help the golem evolve through five unique forms that each bring new abilities to aid the two companions on their journey. Decipher the tower's cryptic pictographs to find clues to its ancient builders and the origins of the mysterious golem.",
