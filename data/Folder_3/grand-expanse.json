    "About the game": "Transport yourself to another world in this surreal mobile VR music video for Martina Sorbara and The Tiny Sun's track “Grand Expanse'. The project was co-developed by Tendril and Drew Lightfoot (of Someplace Nice) as a design-driven VR music video in early 2015 for Samsung Gear. The dreamlike experience was created by using a combination of beautifully constructed 3D + 2D assets. The finishing touch was our heroine Martina Sorbara’s performance, captured live as point cloud data that was then projected into the 360-degree animated wonderland — culminating in an immersive ‘grand expanse’. Built to be an age-neutral and inclusive experience, the participant needs only to gently move their head around in order to calmly interact with this ethereal space.",
