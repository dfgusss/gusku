    "About the game": "* Track on the trailer is Electro Light - Symbolism from NCS. Track not included in the game. Rhythm detection is automatic using a real time algorithm * Groove Balls is Disco Escrima. An intense rhythm game that equips you with sticks and blades and pits you against a barrage of balls generated by the music. Balls come in two colours. Starting from empty handed, you grab a ball to charge a weapon for one shot. If you then strike a ball of the same colour you score a hit. Striking the other colour won't score immediately but will set the weapon to omni which can hit any colour. Final score depends on matching balls and weapons. The groove is automatically detected with fine detail from your own mp3 so you can enjoy your favourite music tracks while having a mental and physical workout. The game's difficulty is automatically adjusted in real time based on the player's performance making for dynamic, enjoyable and always challenging playthroughs.",
