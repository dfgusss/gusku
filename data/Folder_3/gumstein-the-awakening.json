    "About the game": "Solve puzzles and evade hazards by unlocking abilities as you progress through the levels on your quest to find Ruby. Abilities include splitting and stretching, smashing through floors and sticking to walls, launching objects or even your other half! Gumstein: The Awakening is a 2D platform game that focuses on dexterity and puzzle-solving to advance through the levels. Unlock new abilities as you progress. Each new ability adds a new dimension for solving puzzles and getting through obstacles. Test your ambidexterity with Gumstein’s split ability as you navigate levels and solve puzzles using both halves (sometimes at the same time). Depending on the difficulty level you select, Gumstein can be a casual puzzle solving game, or give you an adrenaline rush as you race to beat the clock on the hardest difficulty of this intense and complex puzzle platform game.",
