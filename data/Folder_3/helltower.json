    "About the game": "Remember when games were tough? Helltower is an homage to an era when games were unforgiving and required genuine skill and determination to complete. Inspired by the C64 classic Tower of Terror, and with elements of classic platformers such as Ghouls 'n' Ghosts and Castlevania, Helltower is a retro hardcore action experience. With the aim of reaching the top of the tower to defeat the evil Professor Blood, the player must overcome the many fiendish traps and minions lurking above them. Combining a simple control system and concept with high difficulty level, Helltower will provide a fiendishly difficult challenge for even the most seasoned gamer. Key Features Retro hardcore action experience Handcrafted pixel animation Original retro style soundtrack Over 20 unique enemies and traps 3 different weapons to wield Simple control design with customisable input Full controller support Steam achievements",
