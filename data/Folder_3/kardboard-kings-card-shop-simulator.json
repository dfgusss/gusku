Earn reputation with customers, beat your shop goals, unlock new decorations, and host exciting events to bring everyone to the best Card shop in town! You are Harry Hsu, a young man who recently inherited a card shop from his father, a former champion of the famous card game 'Warlock.' With the shop’s reputation on the line, you start working behind the counter, juggling the locals' requests while trying to familiarize yourself with owning a shop. Your guide, Giuseppe, a fast-talking Cockatoo, helps you in your buying and selling journey - securing cards of various rarities to top collectors or helping an enthusiastic customer from the neighbourhood.",
