    "About the game": "King Of The Sandcastle is an asynchronous online multiplayer pokemon-like dungeon crawling king of the hill game with permadeath and turn-based battles. What does that mean? In KotS you go on dungeons runs with a single card. Before entering the castle you can choose which card you want to take. These card can be cheap, weak ones like 'Worm', or powerful hard-to-get cards like 'Lobster'. During your run you go through rooms in which half of the time you'll encounter an enemy with which you'll have to do a turn-based battle. Enemies in this game are cards of other players that have died in that spot. This also means that if you lose this battle, your card will become an enemy as well! While fighting through the castle you'll also find chest with valuable loot: - different types of shell to buy new (better) cards - badges that you can attach to cards that will give them active or passive abilities Halfway each area you can choose to go to a different, deeper area. At the end of each area there is a boss card waiting for you, defeat this card and your card will automatically become the boss in that area. If you become the boss at least once in every area (except the first main area) you'll be rewarded with the 'key badge'. If a card carries the key badge they will be able to open the door at the end of the first main area 'The Hallway' and pass through to the final hidden area the 'Throne Room'. If you become the boss there, you'll be the one and only, King of the Sandcastle! Only 1 player can be king at a time! Features 20+ hour playtime 22 different cards 24 different badges/moves to find 6 different areas to explore asynchronous online gameplay Sokpop makes a new game every two weeks!
