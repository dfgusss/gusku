Grow your farm by making Kobolds, doing services, and selling product. Improve your farm, buy lewd equipment, and interact with the town denizens. KoboldKare is a DRM-free early-access game made for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers with the following features: A Quake/CS:S movement inspired movement system. Bunnyhop and trimp off of rocks for maximum height, speed-forage the forest with record time. A basic chemical system that lets you mix basic chems and feed them to Kobolds. You can grow only one type of Kobold, but they're capable of being either sex with random stats and proportions! There's a forest that spawns fruit each day, grab them before dawn before they respawn! You can sell both Kobolds, eggs, and produce for cash! Play with an extremely detailed sex penetration system, which includes deformations/knot forces/strands... You can visit several stores in the city which is where you can buy supplies for your farm. Things like machines, eggs, buckets, or pouches to upgrade your grab limit. Working multiplayer! Manage a farm with your friends, or have sex with 8-16 other players online!",
