    "About the game": "Your mission is to find BBQ sauce for your people and bring it back to them. Fighting off thousands of zombies with only your massive cleaver and equally massive cleavage. The game is played with simple arcade mechanics (move left, move right, high attack, low attack), and it starts you off with an easy amount of zombies to re-kill. But each level adds more and more zombies, and eventually dogs that will chew your face off in a couple seconds. New in the Awesome Edition For people who play the whole game in one sitting I wanted to give them a break from the repetitiveness of hacking and slashing 2D zombies. So in the later half of the game I added new levels where you hack and slash (or shoot) 3D zombies!! Pretty brilliant right? I think so.",
