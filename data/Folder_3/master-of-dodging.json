In order to set the kingdom free from 5 devils,the king challenged the devils.The devils are always feeling boring,so they discuss to accept the king's challenge,and set a series of levels.Once the human race can pass these levels one by one,the devils would leave this land,and invade no more. The king readily accepted this evil request,but what he didn't know was that the devils didn't want human beings to pass the challenge at all. After more than half a year's efforts,hundreds of Braves in the kingdom who have accepted the challenge can not pass even one level of the devils.It's time to pay tribute to the demons for this year.At this time, a witch claims that she can summon some heroes with different talents from parallel worlds.The helpless king has to let her try. When the king gathered all the materials for the witch's summoning ceremony,the witch successfully summoned the first hero from parallel worlds.A Hero named Dodging came out of the portal.He called himself a Parkour Expert and was willing to break through the levels for the king. Since then, our story has begun.",
