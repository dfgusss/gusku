    "About the game": "Mini Mini-Golf - a minimalistic game about golf in the casual genre. In it, you have to go through levels on which your main task will be to drive the ball into the hole with the help of a club, but everything is not so simple. Firstly, you will have a limit on the number of hits, so you have to accurately calculate each of your moves. Secondly, but each of the levels has its own difficulty, somewhere it is a winding path from the starting point to the finish line, somewhere barricades, mills with narrow passages in them, fake holes and many more difficulties interfere with passing directly. To complete the game, you will need practice and skill in order to calculate with extreme accuracy each of your moves, the force of the blow, in order to get the ball to the right place and not fly out of the map, accidentally not get on the wrong path, and vice versa, to get out of there.",
