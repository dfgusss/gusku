Things take a dark turn when Ruby sees that Mr. Hopp, who usually sits motionless in the corner of her room, is gone. Make your way through the house while running and hiding from Mr. Hopp to try and uncover the mystery involving her toy rabbit. Jump over the toys Ruby has left laying around, if you touch them, the sound could draw Mr. Hopp right to you. Make sure you take your time, one wrong move could be dangerous.
