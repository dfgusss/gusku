Pacal is enraged at the desecration of sacred sites and the destruction of the environment. He connects with an artificial intelligence known as Zacharias, which will help him fulfill seven missions and save terrestrial biodiversity. But Zach knows there is an evil force behind Dr. Wellin's terrible deeds. Is it an ancient god enemy of Pacal? The Rio Doce (sweet river) was a paradise for mankind and animals, but now it has become a territory destroyed by the unscrupulous activities of Dr. Wellin. This is Pacal's first destination, going up the Rio Doce preventing its complete destruction, passing through the trails of fire until reaching the Domo, laboratory of the nefarious villain, to recover the sacred relic stolen from the ancient Krenak people.",
