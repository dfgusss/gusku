    "About the game": "Join our Discord if you're looking for players! From the creators of Stifled comes Muffled Warfare, a brave new entry into the echolocation-game genre. Muffled Warfare is a multiplayer first-person echolocation shooter where everyone is blind and uses sounds to SEE , SHOOT and SILENCE their competition. You've heard of that blind superhero that dresses up like a devil in red right? Yea, think that, but with guns. ECHOLOCATION - Use sound to SEE, SHOOT and SILENCE the competition. STEALTH MECHANICS - Fade into the darkness that is silence. MULTIPLAYER MAYHEM - Silence or be Silenced? FAST-PACED ACTION - There was too much walking in Stifled. E-SPORTS - We were told this drives traffic and draws investments. OUTLANDISH WEAPONS - Because regular weapons are, meh. FUTURE-GEN AI - Patent Pending BI (Burden Intelligence) SKINS - We know you love'em 4K HDR GRAPHICS - Gotta get in on them buzzwords. COLORS - Like, 4 of them. Like we said, It wasn't a joke.",
