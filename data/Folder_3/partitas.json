    "About the game": "Partitas is the musical game based on melody. It is classical music rich, so it suits those who like it and also those who want to know more of it! The universe played a practical joke on you: your music scores were stained and are unreadable! Listening to the songs and rewriting them is the only way out. It is the ideal game for any music lover: No need to understand sheet music to play 150+ notes to be resolved, both the melody (higher notes) and the accompaniment (lower notes) 11 different composers : Chopin, Schumann, Beethoven, Schubert, Bach, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Mendelssohn, Granados, Chiquinha Gonzaga. At the end of each challenge, you have the opportunity to relax and listen to the complete piece , performed by a true pianist. At that moment, you contemplate the pixelated scenery, which can be customized by buying collectibles using the game's currency.",
