    "About the game": "The millennium tsunami destroyed everything except a handful of scattered islands. The life that was born has not yet reached the problems of the old world, is began and ended with the music. All action takes place around grains - containers of life, freely moved by characters in the arena and used for throwing and spawning. We start with 6* players, who must compete by knocking out the rest to gain points from each hit. *If all goes well, it will be 12 - How to play? 1. Choose your region. 2. You can use CONNECT to fast play, or CREATE/JOIN to create room with numeric tag (you have 10s to cooperate with friends in same region). 3. After 30s (6 players - immediately) pastime in lobby voting will started and 2 players can start the match. 4. The time is limited, but should be enough for a fun. - How to find grain? - The character will look, if not distracted by others, but you will hear it much earlier. The grains sound, we have more than 20 awesome loops to start with. - How to win? - Your hits - your score, all grains used - the match is over. - How to customize? - Over time, you will reach all characters: Asher, Tori, Bob, Iva, Lev, Leon. Their emotions and poses are chosen randomly. You get near 20 poses and 20 emotions. Technically magic: - Dozens procedurally generated islands. - Muscle based movement, social and environment interaction. - Procedural picking up and throwing mechanics. - Emotional interactions.",
