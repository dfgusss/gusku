    "About the game": "Pixel Fishies is a retro inspired game for 1-16 players . Lead a school of fish to eat food, grow, and destroy! Up to 16 players may compete on a shared screen. Each player starts by choosing a school to lead. Choose different schools to compete against each other, or the same school for co-op play. Move your leader to guide fish in your school. School fish generally follow their leader, but may seek food or attack other schools depending on their personality: Blue fish are the best hunters. The will seek food farther away than any other school. Green fish are the fastest. They can also swim at a steep angle. Yellow fish are friendly. They never attack other schools and stay close to the leader. Red fish are aggressive toward other schools. They will seek food, but are most focused on eating other fish. When two fish of one color contact a single fish of another color, the two fish eat the other color. All but the yellow school will use this property to pair up and hunt. Try to catch these power ups: Size: your leader can eat other fish without a partner Evade: no other schools can attack yours Shield: protects from jellyfish stun or squid capture Speed: all fish in your school move faster Add: +5 fish to your school Add: +10 fish to your school Add: +20 fish to your school Add +50 fish to your school Some critters you may eat: Plankton are the most common food source. Jellyfish are a good source of food for fish that avoid their tentacles. Starfish will release a substance which eliminates nearly all fish. As your school eats, your food meter will fill up. When full, a new fish will join your team!",
