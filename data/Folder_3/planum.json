    "About the game": "PLANUM is a 2D raner in which you will operate an aircraft in the vicinity of the World. You have both allies and enemies. But PLANUM would not be such an interesting game if not for the addition of a third kind of aircraft. 'Nitral' aircraft are not, neither enemies, nor allies. Unfortunately you can not know who you are going to score, and only thanks to your intuition you can get the bonus you need. PLANUM is one of the most difficult games! You will have to work hard to get to the final design. What is your reward at the end? Firstly, the game is endless. You can get as many points as your heart desires. And secondly, the way passed is a reward! Is waiting for you: - Author's graphics - Unusual GamePlay - Form style - Beautiful music - Endless game",
