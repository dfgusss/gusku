    "About the game": "Story of one hard-working Raccoon who is searching for gold. Your goal is to help Raccoon find all gold and not get into trouble. Gameplay base on nonograms logic. Nonograms, also known as Picross or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be coloured or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of '4 8 3' would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets. You will be involved in a long Raccoon story during which you will gain experience and become able to solve huge complex and interesting puzzles. In case you will be stuck on some point, you will have 3 types of different bonuses: - Magic Stick for Poking - Shield of Invulnerability - Farsighted Companion With these magic tools, you will reach success and become real master of nonogram mining! Good luck, The Brave Savior of Raccoons! Update 1.0.1 - Fix - steam leaderboard now updated on the level end - Reduced energy consumption per 1 round - Fix - level selection menu now shows the correct section - Reduced bonus prices - Added sounds to buttons",
