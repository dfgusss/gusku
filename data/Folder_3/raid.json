    "About the game": "'My future had to be the brightest. At least, that's what I thought.' Three Stones, small sleepy town on the edge of the world, hidden safe and sound behind the mountains. Our people are devout and pious, shunning from the vanities of the world. In this place misdeeds are a rare, and one stolen dog makes a scandal. 'My home.' Raid is a detective visual novel with choices and consequences, unfolding in a cold, slow-paced, lost-in-time way of the scandinavian tv-shows. It's a story about coming back home, to your new old life and being immediately dragged into a tornado of troubles. Now you need to find the one responsible for a crime before the hell breaks loose. Make your way through the second shard of the mirror universe. You'll make a good hound, your mentor told you. The game features: second installment of the mirror universe; female protagonist and a colourful, wide and varied supporting cast; multiple different endings with some epilogues on top, concluding and explaining things that happened to some of the characters; choices that'll make you face the consequences of your actions; interactive detective board with suspects and clues; adult content; overally distressed characters and questions of belief;",
