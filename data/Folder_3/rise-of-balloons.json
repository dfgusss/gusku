    "About the game": "With your help, one hopeful child will be able to solve puzzles and share her joy with the other residents, but a single balloon is not enough... In this adventure game, you have to use your brain to spread happiness by giving away balloons! Use your wits, your environment and, of course, your balloons to cross the city’s streets, factories and sewers in your grand journey of distributing balloons and smiles to everyone! How can balloons save a whole city? Well, the balloons that you control are not exactly ordinary. You can use them to destroy the environment, glue stuff together and even fly away! You will need to use all these tricks and more to achieve your goal. But beware, for balloons are as fragile as they come, and hazards are plentiful in this hostile city. If your balloons don’t fly away, they might burst because of dangerous, spiky machinery. Handle with care! Features: Head-wracking puzzles with many solutions. Use your balloons wisely! Adventure through a gloomy industrial city. Feel the sadness that you try to repel! Multiple balloon types allow you to fly, destroy obstacles or glue stuff together! Simple and intuitive controls allow you to concentrate on solving the next challenge! Listen to beautifully composed music by Productions Musique Nordique!",
