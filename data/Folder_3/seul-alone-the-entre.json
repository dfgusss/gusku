    "About the game": "CONTENT WARNING. THIS GAME CONTAINS IMAGES OF MEDICAL-SURGICAL HORROR &amp; BODY HORROR THAT SOME PLAYERS MAY FIND GRAPHIC AND/OR DISTURBING. Throw yourself down the rabbit hole of this detective style horror novel. The first of the series, like a disturbing bad dream, this CYOA is possibly unlike anything you have read before. A vast cast of bizarre, idiosyncratic and horrific characters, multiple endings, mystery, deep lore to discover depending how bold your playstyle, and pieces to the puzzle hidden in every dark corner. Reading between the lines of this psychological thriller will make you feel like you’re in a Lynchian film and you’re all alone. Depending on your point of view you will find it deeply meaningful or discordantly meaningless, but either way the ambience will play with your mind and make your skin crawl. It is not supposed to be comfortable. Why should you explore this place? Because this standalone story is only the beginning of a mystery that is going to unravel across multiple games. The series will be a mix of interactive fiction, and be expanded in to the third dimension in a fully fledged first person mystery. So... Can you save Peggy? Seul.(Alone) is a philosophical thriller, meaning it is a thriller based on philosophical ideas and contains horror elements. A narrative told with ideas of nihilism, existentialism, surrealism, solipsism and absurdist. The story plays on these thoughts but also presents some dark world where nothing makes much sense at first glance but as one adapts to it, when it manages to invade you; you begin to see that mostly everything is staged within the game for a reason, a motivation sits behind every image and sentence. But at times those dreams can still affect you if you lay there and really begin to pull them apart and ask why, what was the reason for that? Where did those thoughts come from? What is my subconscious communicating, where are the links to my life? Now you are studying the dream… and there’s a whole ocean of stuff behind that now, connections, motivations and meanings. This is what I want to achieve in Seul.(Alone) and you mostly ever find yourself studying those areas of your life when you are truly Seul.(Alone).",
