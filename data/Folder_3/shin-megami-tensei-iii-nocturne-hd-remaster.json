What begins as a normal day in Tokyo turns out to be everything but, when the Conception—an ethereal apocalypse—is invoked. The remains of the world are swallowed by chaos, as a demonic revolution descends into a broken city. Caught between a battle of Gods and demons, the choices you make can bring life, rebirth, or death, and determine who triumphs. This genre-defining, infamously punishing RPG is back and now includes: Remastered 3D models and backgrounds Additional difficulty settings Suspend save: save your progress whenever you need! Voiced audio: choose between Japanese and English VO Steam Achievements and Trading Cards",
