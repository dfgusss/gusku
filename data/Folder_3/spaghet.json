    "About the game": "Very few can resist the temptation of a warm plate of Spaghet... nor can you. Its a quiet night. You settle down, ready to sink your hands into that stringy goodness, but there's just one problem: That's not your Spaghet. This isn't even your house, and the current residents don't take too kindly to having their food slapped around. Suddenly, you hear a voice coming through the TV, then... darkness. All you wanted to do was enjoy a plate of pasta, but now its about survival... and pasta. Papa, Mama, Baby, and Goldie are coming for you. They see what you're doing, and they all want a piece... of you, that is. With the Spaghet getting cold, you'll need to keep it warm while dealing with them. Somebody has to touch it, right? ============================================================ Your Objective: Touch the Spaghet to keep it warm for as long as possible, while avoiding being caught by Papa, Mama, Baby, and Goldie. Each one is dealt with in a different way. Be sure to look at the TV whenever you hear static... -Simple, yet challenging, gameplay -The goal is not completion, but to survive for as long as possible. -Compare you time with friends on the Leaderboard.",
