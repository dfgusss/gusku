Soundtrack by David Arkenstone David Arkenstone, three time Grammy nominee and composer of music for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm brings his sensational talent to bear on Starlight Tactics, with musical themes to accompany every battle. Quotes from Beta Testers: 'In terms of turn based tactics this is very unique. This is the first one of its kind to use 3 dimensions that I know of for movement and placement, and it works and functions very well. In fact this is the only true 3d strategy space game that I can think of since Homeworld movement-wise.' 'The details are great, especially with the battle. Keep up the good work!' 'I ABSOLUTELY LOVE that I can ram, and/or fire upon my fellow ship(s) if I am not careful.' 'The concept of the game is great.' 'Saw you guys at PAX and played on the Android build. Lots of cool details and a great simulation of 3D space combat.'",
