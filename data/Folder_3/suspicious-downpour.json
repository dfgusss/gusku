    "About the game": "Suspicious Downpour is a very short single-player comedy horror experience about getting stuck in a storm while out camping. Welcome to Hanawiti forest, a popular location for adventurous backpackers. Pitch a tent and stay the night in our lush and beautiful backyard. Enjoy the wildlife, enjoy the scenery and have an eye out for Mr. Wilson. Just make sure you don’t get caught in a rainstorm. Sit in your tent with your trusty flashlight in the calm rain and just relax to the sound of rain hitting your tent. Just be warned you may not be alone in the woods and If you look for trouble you just might find it... WARNING: Don’t feed the wildlife and don’t pack any meat. A Note Suspicious Downpour was originally designed and created in the space of a 48 hour game jam. The overall playtime reflects our short development period as the game can be finished in less than 30 minutes. The story isn't designed for multiple playthroughs however we designed the game with the intention that players can replay the game for the ambience and immersion. The keyboard is used as a puzzle mechanic as it is intentional that you cannot walk around About the Game Jam This game was created as an entry for the 2021 Aotearoa Game Jam. The theme was Light and Dark.
