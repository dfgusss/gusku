    "About the game": "The Architect's Game is a 1* to 10 player online first person game where each player must solve a series of riddles or minigames in order to unveil the code required to exit. The spice of the game depends on which mode you choose, as of now, five are available. *Minimum players amount depends on gamemode, G.L.I.T.C.H. and the new Escape Room can be attempted singleplayer, Stalker can be tried with two players but more are desirable. In insidious mode, one or two players will be selected as the insidious and must disrupt the efforts of the rest of players with the help of special equipment they receive in their secret room. Minor weapons are scattered for everyone to pick up. Who to trust, that's up to you. In Victim Hunt, each player receives a target they must disable without the rest of players realizing. Disabling your objective will trigger a vulnerability status which you have to hide for 60 seconds. Watch your back. A player will be selected as the stalker, which cannot see the rest of players and must disable them by hearing their voices and footsteps. Mode especially effective with the implemented Steam Audio solution. G.L.I.T.C.H. is a spooky entity controlled by the AI which will patrol the map trying to prevent the players from solving their code while getting increasingly faster and raising its damage radius. Mode implemented for Halloween 2021 featuring a night version of The Ellipse. The first Escape Room is now available to be enjoyed singleplayer and cooperatively! Players have 30 minutes to guess the data required to exit via collecting items and solving the riddles inside the room. Tick, tock. Plot, betray or defend yourself in the first location of the game: The Ellipse . An introvert original piece of architecture to escape from while trying to solve the 24 different riddles and minigames it features. Deliasi Platform is now available as of October, 20th! Who would build a dwelling in the middle of the ocean? You will have to find out. Score System Each game finished will award points, you can use those points in the lobby to acquire mutagens, poses or cosmetic addons. Mutagens Mutagens moderately alter the way the game is played. Acquire them at the shop and let the host activate them for different effects: gun spawn, smoke devices, jammers, disguises, etc. Spatialized Voice Chat TAG uses Steam Audio spatializer for several sounds and its voice chat system. Voice is physically occluded and attenuated at runtime which means you may eavesdrop a conversation behind a door but no one will hear you scream behind a concrete wall. If you don't want to use voice, there's also a proximity text chat implemented. Community Friends are not included but I want to slowly shape a community of players and content creators interested in the game. If you are a content creator and want to be featured in the lobby's community board, feel free to follow the instructions in #communityadd channel inside the game's Discord . Use forums or join the brand new Discord to suggest new modes or mutagens, report issues there or check the progress on next scene: Deliasi Platform .",
