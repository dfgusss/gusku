Features: Local multiplayer, up to 5 players (4 xinput compatible gamepads + 1 keyboard). Add bots to your matches to make it more challenging! Just one level, but includes lots of randomness with its items: power-ups, weapons, punishments, etc... Try them all! 8-bit sound FX and a catchy Tiki tribal song.
