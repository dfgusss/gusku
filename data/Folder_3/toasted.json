    "About the game": "Outwit and outplay your friends in first-to-3 style matches. Joust with your pals; only one can remain victorious on the battlefield. Action packed and super fast, each round is a quick fight, great for passing the controller at parties. Simple stick controls are used to maneuver your vehicle, and two buttons to either jump over your opponents or smash them into the air! The controls are easy, but learning to outwit and bait your friends is the fun part. Choose your warrior, from the not-so-sweet Nigiri to the gruff Business Toast. Find a hat that truly speaks to you (and try not to lose it in the rush of battle). Pick a paint job that makes your heart sing. Ranging from a peaceful stony outcropping to a deadly lava lair, pick an arena that will challenge you and your friends. Play against some rather friendly or vicious AI; great for blowing off steam or getting some practice in.",
