    "About the game": "Build a medieval village within a completely interactively simulated world! Townsmen VR uses the exciting possibilities of virtual reality to further enhance the classic city building game with entirely new gameplay experiences and interactive mechanics. The game combines elements of a God-game simulation and a classic building game with the interactive possibilities of VR controls. Whether from a bird's eye view or zoomed in close, you will always experience the action from the right perspective. Start with a small settlement and expand your might over a world of 13 different islands and archipelagos. Filled to the brim with exciting features, gizmos, and things to lay your virtual hands-on. Build more than 20 unique buildings and upgrade them. Immerse yourself in a thrilling story with many exciting quests or play completely free in the sandbox mode with goals set by you. Hours of fun are guaranteed! As the population of your empire grows, so does the demand for food and goods. Production chains help you meet this need. When you build farms, you can grind the grain harvest there at the mill and bake delicious bread for your Townies from the flour. Your windmill won’t operate when the winds are calm? No worries, give those wings a push. Slap that lazy dude with a fish or help your citizens collect about 20 different raw materials. You want to see the world you helped create from the view of a townsman? Use your godly powers and scale yourself to experience your town at eye level with your townies. Farm animals such as cows, sheep, and chickens provide you with important resources to produce food. Your hunters will find rabbits and deer to stalk. You have to be careful of wild animals like wolves or bears that you encounter! Seagulls are eager to steal your catch, while above the battlefields the crows' caw and high up in the sky eagles fly free. In time you should begin to also hire soldiers to defend your realm against intruders and enemy forces! Besides different types of soldiers, you can also make use of heavy artillery: A catapult can punch sensitive gaps in the enemy’s ranks! And should you run out of boulders, remember: everything you can lay your hands on can be used as ammo! But the enemy kingdom is not the only problem your soldiers will have to face. Some islands are infested with sinister pirates who are after your precious resources! Intuitive control of the environment helps you move about – you can literally crawl over the island or move your viewpoint as you would position your images on your smartphone. You’ll get accustomed to ruling your empire very fast. Most of the islands you visit during the campaign can be unlocked for unrestricted play in the sandbox mode. You'll be able to choose whether you want to play completely without constraints, or give yourself a bit of excitement and accept the challenges you choose. Determine the number of townies you start the game with, defeat all opponents or fight against thieving pirates – the various settings offer you enough freedom for your personal gaming experience! Story: A fully-voiced campaign and story arching over 13 islands. Simulation: Assign jobs and tasks to your villagers to build your supply chains and economy. Town-planning: Unlock more than 20 unique buildings and place them freely within your village to optimize transport routes. Apply upgrades to make them better! Upgrades: Conduct research for further upgrades of your buildings. Trading: Build a harbor to have a trader's ship and begin treasuring up riches. Experience: Brush over trees, form clouds into dangerous thunderstorms, go fishing with your bare hands and talk to your townies. Interaction: Simply carry workers or resources directly to their destination to speed up the construction of buildings and production. Fight: Recruit brave soldiers, build catapults, bows, and crossbows to protect your island from the Black Knights raiding henchmen. Tutorial: Your personal advisor Sir Clunk-a-lot will accompany you on your virtual tour of the medieval age with useful tips. Sandbox Mode: Get creative and try out the game conditions you set in free play. Decide for yourself which tasks you want to complete and enjoy full freedom! Sound: Medieval music, adorable sound effects, and a classy English voiceover ensure a fitting atmosphere. funding support by",
