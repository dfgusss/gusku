    "About the game": "This is an art-game about a 4th Millenium corporation ZN, which semi-automatically mines astral particles from simulated human minds. Though, as the player assumes a direct control over such a pawn, nothing of the surrounding lore is shown, and this is exactly the author's intent. You decide the fates, but don't see anything actually going on. Imagine your purpose is just to simulate a human's decision making system, in a lack of information beyond the spreadsheet numbers. Key features: - Mini JRPG-like battles; - Global map of points; - 9 levels with bosses and treasures; - Console interface reminiscent of retro operating systems; - Cryptic symbols in the background;",
