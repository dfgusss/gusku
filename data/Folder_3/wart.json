    "About the game": "Hello, everyone. I'm leiry the ape. I'm glad you can enter this store interface. Before you buy or leave, here are some of my thoughts. I hope you can have a look. This is a game inspired by classic chess. At the same time, I add some elements of chess and cards. But you can rest assured that this will not make it chaotic and uncoordinated. When I was making, I set myself three principles: 1. No random, pure strategy game. (I don't believe in randomness anymore after the bottom guarantee is crooked 2. It is very simple and easy to understand. The description of the chess piece is no more than 50 words (when the man playing chess downstairs can understand how to play the game in half an hour, I will be successful 3. Small size. In fact, you can't feel this one. In fact, I write more code and play, so I care more about how to realize a function with better algorithm and simpler code than writing many messy functions (although I write it with UE4 blueprint) Besides, there's nothing to say. Have fun. （google translation）φ (&gt; ω",
