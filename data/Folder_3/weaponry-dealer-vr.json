    "About the game": "Game Play - You are fairly new gun shop owner with enough money to kick start your business. It is up to you to buy shelves and re-stock your inventory to keep up with the demand. However, as a legal gun shop owner you must sell guns legally. Therefor to check every buyer's permit number. Some buyers get creative and will give you fairly close permit numbers or will give you a correct permit number with the wrong picture on it. Watch out as hurting your reputation will effect your sales directly. As you gain more experience you can expand your gun shop and purchase Armory, where you will be able to sell Army Trucks, APC and TANKS. You can also purchase gun factory to make weapons instead of buying them at full price. If you feel bad for those buyer who happen to get rejected by you because they didn't have a good permit. Well, don't. Because they will be back at night to buy that very same gun from you but illegally. It is up to you do that kind of business or not. Just remember, if you get caught, then reputation will get damaged and you would have to pay a fine. Do you really want to be THAT kind of gun shop owner? I am sure you do, hence this game. Do not forget to decorate your apartment with high end furniture and electronics to show how RICH you are. Even though this is a tycoon game it is still in VR, some changes in the genre were made to accommodate.",
