    "About the game": "Notice: As you can see from the screenshots above, the English version of Your Diary + is in a very poor state right now. We are working on a fix, but due to the length of the game, this is taking a long time. If you plan to play the game in Chinese, you have nothing to worry about, but if you plan to play the game in English, please be warned that you are not likely to enjoy it in the way that it was meant to be enjoyed, and we must advise you to wait and buy it later. We're very sorry about this ongoing situation, and we thank you for your continued patience regarding this issue. Your Diary + is a visual novel game that explores the seven ways people experience happiness in the stories of its seven heroines. ・Yua: being useful to someone ・Sayuki: being needed by someone ・Yuhi: being loved by someone ・Kanade: being praised by someone ・Kaho: falling in love with someone ・Natsuki: having a romance with someone ・Hotori: trusting someone Depending on the player’s choices, the heroines’ affection levels will change, and on a certain day their stories will diverge... What kind of happiness will you pursue? Synopsis Nagamine Tomoki is a second-year student at Kazamizaka Academy. Because his parents work abroad, he’s been staying at the home of his childhood friend Minagawa Yuhi ever since he transferred here. He lives a peaceful student life, participating in the library committee and helping out at Yuhi’s family business, the Yuugaotei cafe, after school. Until one day. Tomoki stops by a used bookstore called Fuurindou, near the shopping district, to look for a book recommended to him by Ayase Sayuki, the chairman of the library committee and an upperclassman he admires. Tomoki isn’t surprised to find the interior of the store a match for the deteriorating exterior. The air is humid, the bookshelves are black with dirt, and the many books are covered in dust. Even so, it would be a shame to leave without at least a look around, so he goes hunting for the book he’s after. He wanders around the shop for a little while, casting his eyes about until a certain book catches them. On that back of that old book are the words “your diary”. Strangely curious, he picks it up, turns it over to the cover, and—— A girl pops out, in a wash of warm light. “Are you Yua’s new friend?” After he meets Yua, the strange girl who claims to be a god, destiny begins to move for Tomoki—and for the girls around him. And for a little white diary——",
