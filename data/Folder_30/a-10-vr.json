Shoot down the bomb targets to prevent them from reaching you while shooting other targets for bonus points. New Mode! Can you stay alive in Attack Mode? Dodge incoming missiles and enemy fire while shooting down your foes before they shoot you! Master the game to complete the 13 challenging Steam Achievements.",
