    "About the game": "Something stinks and it smells like crab... again! I hear everyone likes a good remake these days. I figured Nick Bounty may as well get the modern update treatment as well! A Case of the Crabs: Rehash is a complete remake of the original Award Winning Flash-Based adventure game that FHM magazine called 'Pure genius!'. Built from the ground up for modern audiences, but keeping all of the original story and game play intact! Nick Bounty, who despite his ability to solve the most tangled cases, has yet to work for a paying client. This time it’s up to you to discover who knocked off a local seafood salesman and get to the bottom of a diabolical counterfeiting operation FEATURES Classic Point &amp; Click interface. Updated 3D Black &amp; White “film noir” aesthetic Fully re-recorded dialog by the original cast. SOME updated jokes.",
