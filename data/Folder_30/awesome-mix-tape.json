    "About the game": "Remember the 'good old days' when you used to copy your favourite games onto a single cassette tape and produce your own hit compilation? … No, I don't either, I don't know what you're talking about. I'm far too young. Cassettes? Erm… it's like a hard drive but a slower, bulkier, less convenient way of storing your games to play later. But it's fun, you see, because it's retro and physical and it makes satisfying noises when you press the buttons. Anyway, Awesome Mix Tape is a compilation of single mechanic games. Some might be fun, some might be challenging, some might be interesting prototypes for larger games. A selection of games are included for this initial release and more will be regularly added in the future. Keep us installed and regularly receive free updates with our latest micro game.
