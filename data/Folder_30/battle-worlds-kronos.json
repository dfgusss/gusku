    "About the game": "Battle Worlds: Kronos is a classic turn-based strategy game in the tradition of Battle Isle , Advance Wars and Panzer General . Have you ever wondered what games like that would look like today? Well, we did. As a result, we decided to develope Battle Worlds: Kronos. Key Features: Two Single Player Campaigns (~50 hours of gameplay) Single Player Challenge Maps - Test your skills in different combat scenarios and keep track of your progress. Live Multiplayer - Battle your friends live on the internet (cross-platform) or via hot-seat. Asynchronous Multiplayer - Take all the time you need and consider your moves. Similar to 'play-by-mail', your round is stored on our server and turned over to your opponent. The system allows you to continue the match anytime and anywhere you want (cross-platform). Online Features - Leagues, chat and - in early 2014 - tournaments. Strong AI - A clever AI that will challenge even experienced commanders. Map Editor - A powerful editor to create your own maps and missions (Windows only). Includes 'Trains' DLC - Additional ~15 hours campaign, new units and new multiplayer maps",
