    "About the game": "Blind Drive is an audio-based, black comedy action arcade game. The entire game is experienced through your ears. You're blindfolded and going against traffic. Cars rushing past, angry drivers yelling at you. Cops on your tail. And a sadistic madman on the phone. Can you do it? Play as Donnie, trying to make a quick buck in a scientific study but quickly finding himself in over his head, cuffed to the wheel and driving blindfolded against traffic. Plus he's late for dinner with Grandma. ** Headphones required ** FEATURES Hyper-immersive 1st-person audio - so good you can play with your eyes closed Fast-paced, 2-button arcade gameplay 27 levels of mayhem including boss fights, secret areas and a very rude G.P.S. Hilarious crime-comedy story with mobsters, dolphins and your angry Grandmother, performed by a full cast of voice actors Minimalistic, jazzy visuals Gamepad support including extra-fine haptics (rumble) Full text-to-speech accessibility - supports NVDA and Windows TTS.
