    "About the game": "Insectville was a warm and charming mid-west community, one of those that leave doors open at night and everybody know everybody little society. You used to describe it as 'so sweet that made you vomit, drink bleach and literally gave you cancer'. After 4 combat tours (Radio Operator, -1 confirmed kills) going back home wasn't easy - you knew the dooms day was coming, it was just a matter when. As cheerful as you were, despite all your flaws, community welcomed you back with open hands, you started your life once again, settled down, wife, kids and barbeques. Having joyful life didn't shatter your insticts a bit, you kept stacking a stash of ammo &amp; guns in the basement. Sunday evenings with your former marine buddies, throwing cans on your neighbour's lawn, calling him piece of trash, pulling him out of house, giving him a free waterboarding eperience - You all had sincere laugh - this just couldn't last forever. And finally, it came. When you suddenly woke up in the middle of day, you realized you are alone, literally the whole town was empty. As an experienced soldier you spotted enourmous beetle looking at you with what you could swear was 'the smile on his face'. You rushed back to your house directly to the basement, you have been preparing for this your whole life. The time has come. Blood Feed - The Mystery of Insectville is FPS depthless and mindless shooter, where you, smashing through the waves of bugs, insects and hordes of most disgusting things that ever roamed the earth, need to unravel the mysterious dissapearance of the whole town, including your family. Multiple enemy types including various bosses will make you puke at first sight and shoot and run for your life.",
