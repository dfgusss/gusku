    "About the game": "This game is an homage to Hbomberguy 's legendary charity stream in support of Mermaids, a UK-based charity and advocacy organization that supports gender diverse &amp; transgender children and teenagers! In this game inspired by a 1999's classic, you can... Fight back against thieving Greyman Grifterham and his horde of beavery bullies Experience the thrill (and frustration) of herding low-poly beavers into a bottomless pit Play on 'Classic' or 'Fair' difficulty Complete three levels and retrieve all money that has been stolen Beat your personal high scores Herd beavers into the pit and collect a total of $347,137.30 , to win the game! In Classic difficulty mode, if beavers walk straight towards the hole they'll stop and not fall in! The 'trick' is to make sure you steer them towards the hole, but not directly at it: Always mind the angle at which beavers are walking towards the pit! If you manage to make a beaver walk closely past the hole, it's a good chance to give them a little scare: Usually, they will jump right in! For a simpler way to bother the beavers, switching to the Fair difficulty mode will make beavers run straight into the pit! (If you steer them that way) With special thanks to the amazing Hbomberguy , Casey Explosion , Shaun , the The Skeleton Crew , and everyone who has donated time or money, to make the Mermaids stream the success it was!",
