    "About the game": "► RUN AND GUN. Brain / Out is a multiplayer shooter with a nostalgic post-Soviet feel. Experience dynamic battles and exterminate your enemies with a large arsenal of modern weaponry. Lock'n'load! ************************************************************** ► KNOW YOUR ENEMY. Mercenaries and Marauders fight not for the ideals of their country or society, but for cash. Stay alive and earn money with every kill — the only driving force of this conflict taking place at a former Soviet republic. ************************************************************** ► NO 'PAY TO WIN'. It doesn’t matter how well your enemy is equipped — a skilled fighter will always have a chance to win. You can change the outcome of any fight without a single round fired — take out your knife and bring the opposition to their knees. ************************************************************** ► CUSTOM LOADOUT. Brain / Out offers a wide range of weapons — both NATO and Warsaw Pact rifles, shotguns, pistols, sniper rifles and melee weapons. ************************************************************** ► MODIFY AND UPGRADE. Improve your weapon stats and upgrade the level of your favorite weapons with different parts — scopes, handles, barrels, receivers, mounts and bars. Collect and disassemble trophies to get new parts and improve your Tech level. ************************************************************** ► ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT. Use special equipment to survive a bit longer. Bulletproof vests and helmets, stun and frag grenades, under-barrel grenade launchers, anti-personnel mines and more. ************************************************************** ► CLIMB THE SKILL LADDER. The better you fight, the more weapons you get! Get to the TOP 100 and receive a unique weapon set.",
