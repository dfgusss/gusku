    "About the game": "Braverz is a fast paced co-op third person MOBA game that incorporates elements of tower defense and base building.Unlike other MOBAS where the focus is on killing other players, in Braverz, collaboration is pivotal in order to defeat the horde of NPCs trying to destroy the base. Players will have to strike a balance between upgrading their base structures, weapons and skills while holding and pushing back the invaders. After turning back the enemy hordes, players will have to face their ultimate commander : an Ancient of unknown skill and Power… are you brave enough to join? Choose the Braver that speaks to your soul! Each Braver has unique skills and abilities that will affect how you play. Think that true warriors are only those who go into the middle of the fray? Gortak’s hammer and Jon’s sword are at the ready! Like to keep your foes at a distance? No problem! Xaprix and Tigon might like to have a word with you. There are no defined roles so go ahead and give them all a try to see who fits your playstyle. Use your powers to defend the realm! Hacking, Slashing and Smashing is fun but why stop there? In order to join Braverz each champion must demonstrate that they have that special, undefinable something that sets them apart from the rest. Their powers are your disposal, use them wisely. Work as a team to turn the tide! Lone wolf's are cool to look at, but when going after prey the pack always triumphs. Teamwork is essential in Braverz and usually the only way to win a game. Invite your friends and work together for glory and riches! Exciting new perspective Tired of feeling detached from your character? Of viewing things from your tower but never experiencing true adventure? Well we have a solution for that! Braverz third person perspective will put you square in the middle of the action. Use your powers, skills and strategies while being immersed in this wonderful world of magic and myth.",
