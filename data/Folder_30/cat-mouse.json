    "Name": "CAT & MOUSE",
    "Release date": "Oct 4, 2019",
    "About the game": "Cat &amp; Mouse is a fast paced, asymmetrical, multiplayer game where you play a game of well.. cat and mouse. One team is mice, the other is cats - Mice run and hide from cats while trying to grab as much food as they can before they either starve or run out of time, while Cats hunt down the mice or successfully keep the mice from surviving or scoring the amount of points they need to win. Players will need to try to outsmart and outmaneuver each other to accomplish their goals. The art style, audio and mechanics make Cat &amp; Mouse into an intense yet lighthearted experience especially with friends or playing within a community. The heavy contrast and audio/visual effects makes this lighthearted Co-op/PVP game into an intense experience that feels equally terrifying and fun. Buy a copy or two to play with friends. Cat &amp; Mouse will release from Early Access soon and I cannot wait to show everyone what I have been working on! Thanks for playing Cat &amp; Mouse! Join the Discord: - I am always online and will be posting there far more frequently than the steam page. Check out the Roadmap on my Trello Board : -mouse - This will be updated more as I get use to updating it.",
