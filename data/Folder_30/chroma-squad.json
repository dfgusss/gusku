Once the cameras are rolling, you will control your cast of five colored-jumpsuit-clad warriors in dramatic, turn-based battles! Customize your TV studio: hire actors, upgrade your gear, do marketing, craft weapons, costumes and giant cardboard robots! Tactical RPG combat with a twist: combine your heroes’ abilities with Teamwork maneuvers! In-Depth RPG systems with skill trees, random equipment, crafting, and branching storyline with 3 different endings! Giant Mecha combat – destroy the city to save the city! A love letter to Power Rangers, Tokusatsu and the Japanese series of our childhoods! Deliciously-animated pixel art and a chiptune soundtrack that shines like justice!",
