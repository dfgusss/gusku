New puzzles are unlocked by building contraptions quickly and efficiently. Inventor Mode: Starting with simple puzzles, players are introduced to the widgets that are used to build machines &#151; gears, pipes, balloons, chimes, hammers, wheels, props, and more. Time Challenge Mode: If you finish a puzzle in Inventor Mode, it will be unlocked here. This time, it will take fewer moves to reach a solution, but you only have 30 seconds to find it. Move Challenge Mode: Take your time and plan ahead. Every click counts when you only get ten moves to find a solution.",
