In the following days of this unfortunate event, Emily, Anabelle's older sister, begins to communicate with her little sister's soul in her lucid dreams. At first, Emily believes these dreams were caused by the impact of experiencing the loss of a loved one. But the intensity of these episodes begins to increase gradually, and she is convinced that little Anabelle's soul is somehow trapped in purgatory... and in need of help!. Emily learns about the dark past of the Ramsey Mansion in her research to find out what happened to her sister and decides to tell her boyfriend, Nathan, about these dreams.
