    "About the game": "Cyborg Earthworm is a 'Snake' automation game. The worm follows the rules of the famous Snake game, and you can program it. Develop a strategy and let the worm follow it without your involvement. Solve and optimize 20+ areas, each of which contains a virtually unlimited number of procedurally generated levels. Watch the worm dominate the levels automatically without having to pilot it. Reach the maximum possible length, filling all free space. Use a variety of tools like paint spray for leaving marks in the soil and internal worm memory for tracking things.",
