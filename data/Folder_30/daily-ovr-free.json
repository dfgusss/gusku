For example, Elite dangerous, PokerStarVR ...etc The issue is caused by Elite Dangerous tries to run in Oculus SDK mode, and Daily OVR doesn't support Oculus SDK. There is a workaround to force it to run in SteamVR mode, but it doesn't work every game (ED, PokerStarVR are OK). You may have controller issues. The possible problem is the game developer didn't think that users will forcibly use SteamVR to play the game; they didn't design the controller mapping correctly. You can search 'daily ovr q&amp;a' on Google to see the steps. How many overlays can I open? You can open up to 5 overlays. But it depends on your PC's performance. If performance is terrible, you could try: Close the overlays Set lower FPS value The button mappings of controllers are not good. Can I change it? Daily OVR supports SteamVR 2.0 Input. You can customize button settings yourself. I don't like the big icon/logo! Can I make it disappear? Yes, you can hide the icon by long-pressing a button. See below: I cannot see/move my mouse pointer on some apps! Some apps run as administrator permission. When Daily OVR doesn't run as the same permission, it cannot access to those apps. You have to check 'Run this program as an administrator' on DailyVRLauncher.exe Properties. My Firefox screen is blank! You have two options: 1. You have to disable the hardware acceleration of Firefox. See below: 2. Use CustomApp instead Join Daily OVR Discord and share your feedback with us!",
