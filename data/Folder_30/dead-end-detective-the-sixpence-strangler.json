    "About the game": "Dead-End Detective: The Sixpence Strangler is a comedic/thrilling visual novel set in London during the 1950s. Become the famed 'Dead-End Detective' as you investigate a sudden and unexplained series of strangulations in London's East End. Choose how you want to conduct your investigation and interact with a colourful cast of characters along the way. Will you rely on your powers of perception and professionalism to solve this case? Or, will you just wing it and wisecrack your way through to the end? Features... Value For Money! Don’t like paying $10/£10/€10 or more for a visual novel that only lasts three hours or so? Then have no fear, this one is much cheaper and lasts the same length. Meaning more cash to spend on other games. Over 20 Character Sprites! Do you hate it when visual novels introduce characters who don't have any artwork? All the characters that you have conversations with in this game have their own sprites, meaning no more talking to invisible NPCs. Branching Dialog! Features dozens of choices. Choose between being professional or unprofessional. Appeasing or peevish. Smart or smart-mouthed. And, then, live with the consequences. Nameable Protagonist! Tired of playing visual novels with a blank-slate, generic main character with a pre-set boring name? In this story, you can name your character to help you feel more immersed and create a closer connection with the other characters that you meet along the way.",
