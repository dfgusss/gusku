    "About the game": "Divinity Chronicles: Journey to the West is a rogue-like deck building game. You will play as one of the legendary heroes with unique powers (modeled as cards, consumables, and relics), build up powerful teams, and decide the fate of the Realm of Divinity under the omen of darkness. A Rogue-like Game Inspired by the Classic Novel of Journey to the West Each character has multiple unique storylines inspired by the legendary story of Journey to the West. During each play through, you will encounter different opponents, events, quests, all based on your strategies and choices. Each choice you make will deeply impact everyone around you, determining the fate of the Realm of Divinity. Unleash True Power of Each Character Each character has a unique Card set that fits his or her background and characteristics. Carefully make choices for each encounter, build the deck, acquire relics and consumables, and you will unlock various powerful strategies and unleash the true power of the character. For example, Wukong, the Monkey King is one of the most powerful and versatile characters. He can control the length and weight of Monkey King Bar, summon little monkeys with his hair, and shapeshift into enemies and learn their skills against themselves! You Don’t Need to Fight Alone You don’t need to fight alone along this difficult journey to the west. Build up a powerful team by recruiting companions, summoning NPCs, or even luring your opponents to your side. The early access version includes 3 chapters of the story mode gameplay and 3 characters (Wukong, White Dragon, Holy Monk). We will continue developing the game, and adding new characters, contents, features, and game modes periodically.
