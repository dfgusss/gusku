    "About the game": "If the game is not available in your country come to the discord Immerse yourself in the world of the infinitely small in electronics and design your own circuits and systems. The purpose of electrify is to simulate the behavior of electronics, for this purpose it is made available to you several blocks that are actually logic gates. This game is for the electronics engineer as well as for the new player who doesn't know anything about electronics, as long as you like to learn and know more and more about this game. Thanks to the campaign, you discovered little by little all that it is necessary to know about electronics to advance towards more and more complicated levels where one will ask you to succeed in reproducing a table of truth thanks to the circuit which you built. There is also a sandbox/creative mode that allows you to create levels with custom truth tables and challenge your friends and other players with the system you have set up in the game. Every level you complete will earn you reputation points, you can use these reputation points to publish your levels and compete (features that will come later in the game). In order to learn more about the development and to help you we are setting up a discord that will serve as a forum to help you find solutions, discuss the game and give your opinion in a more direct way. You will also have the opportunity to discuss directly with the studio.",
