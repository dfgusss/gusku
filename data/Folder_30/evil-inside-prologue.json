After the death of his mother and the arrest of his father for it, our protagonist Mark tries to contact her through the Spiritual board, which explodes mysteriously and causes Mark to fade away. That's where it all began: a series of paranormal events will torment him while he tries to gather the fragments of the Spiritual board and thus, find what is really happening.
