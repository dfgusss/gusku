    "About the game": "Your goal is to build a thriving village in the wilderness, supplied with a wide selection of food, clothing, tools, books, and magical artifacts that you produce from raw materials. Worker units can help you move goods between production buildings and markets, but as much workload as possible will need to be automated using mechanical transportation systems. Use a combination of gravity-powered chutes, conveyor belts, railroads, pipes, sorters and filters to route items around the map so they can be processed and sold. As your earnings rise, you can research new technology to improve your supply chains and grow your civilization. There's no enemies or starvation to worry about, so you can enjoy a stress-free logistics challenge to maximize production and happiness. - Play through eight built-in campaign maps with unique goals, or start your own customized/random map from scratch - Build complex logical systems with gates, triggers, and filters to make sure resources get to the right destination - Steam Workshop features let you customize rules &amp; even create new items - Unlock magical technology to boost your production buildings to absurd output rates - Terrain sculpting tools to shape the world to suit your needs - Creative/Sandbox mode let you build whatever kind of huge factory you want",
