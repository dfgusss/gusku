What impact does it have on health, cost, and the environment? What is a Nutri-Score? You probably know more than you think - but there will be surprises as well. Play 12 game modes, including an easy BEGINNER mode, PRACTICE solo, the multiplayer CUBE RUN battle, as well as the challenging NO HELP and KNOW-IT-ALL modes. Also, try beating the AI-NPCs.
