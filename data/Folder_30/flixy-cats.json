    "About the game": "Flixy Cats were first seen in an alley in Hollywood, California in 1988. Since then, they have popped up at bus stops and on huge buildings worldwide! Now you can see them in a brand new game! The Flixy Cat world is about to be overrun by ravenous pirate rats! The cats must defend themselves by hitting the rats with marshmallow mallets, sending the rats ot a confetti land where they can have all the garbage they can eat. Flixy Cats is a 3D platform where you can control Max and his entire cat crew. You can explore different worlds, discover new power ups to help in the journey, team up with another cat to assist you and much more. The cats earn extra life by eating burgers along the way and can gain points by picking up cat coin as they run and swim through the landscape (yes, cats can swim!). But be careful, don't let the rats get you! Jump in and help Max and The Flixy Cats in this new adventure!",
