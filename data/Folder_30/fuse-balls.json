    "About the game": "Fuse Balls was created with inspirations of minimalistic art design. Circles of various colors fall towards a center gravitational force creating smooth transitions and requiring color matching to fuse circles. The fun part about the game is how gravity reacts to circles, the circle gravity movements, music, and sound effects help with proving an unique game experience from a very basic match 3 game concept that can challenge the basic or advance player. Features: * Endless gameplay. * Steam achievements. * Steam leaderboard to challenge your friends for a high score. * Very fun power-ups. * Simple keyboard arrow controls (WASD or arrow keys for movement). * Beautiful minimalist art. * Localized in English, Spanish. * Beautiful graphic design. * Unique and relaxing music. * Fluid menu animations. Thank you for playing and supporting an indie game developer. Dilmer Valecillos",
