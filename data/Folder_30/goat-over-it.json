    "About the game": "{STEAM_APP_IMAGE} /extras/Shop_2.png [/] A physics-based game in which you only need two keys to control the balance of a mountain goat to get to the top of the mountain. One key is responsible for the front paw, {STEAM_APP_IMAGE} /extras/00.gif [/] and the second for the key for the hind leg. {STEAM_APP_IMAGE} /extras/02.gif [/] The height of the jump also depends on the duration of pressing. That allows you to make jumps more accurate and careful. Nice graphics will help you feel the game even more [/] At first glance, this is easier than it seems, but if you still managed to complete the game in the checkpoint mode, which helps to understand the mechanics of the game, then the mode without checkpoints will open for you. In which one mistake and you start all over again. [/] If you are a fan of complex games and have passed Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy , then this game is for you.",
