    "About the game": "Welcome to Grabity's ballistic bot brawls! Grabity is a physics-based, arena brawler where 2-4 players wield Grab guns to turn objects into lethal projectiles or makeshift shields. Twin-stick twitch reflexes combine with tactical thinking in this side-on, 2.5D grab ’em up – best enjoyed with friends couch-style for maximum trash-talk and combat shenanigans! Gameplay Players subvert gravity by means of Grab guns, seizing nearby objects and using them as projectiles to pulverize the opposition, or as makeshift shields to block inbound items. Players need twitch reflexes and precise aiming skills, but Grabity also rewards tactical thinkers who can outmaneuver and outwit opponents in this intense, chaotic tango of death. Jostling for position! In a contest of aerial agility, players must turn gravity to their advantage, predicting the trajectories of both projectiles and rival players to secure a brutal hit while snatching their next crate in midair: lobbing objects while blocking attacks, mêlée ebbing and flowing in an elastic ‘footsie battle’ style. Frenetic, fast-paced battles Arenas evolves kinetically as players smash, grab and loot their surroundings – dashing for pickups, hovering momentarily to nail the perfect trajectory and squabbling over the last of the environmental ammo. Intuitive twin-stick controls provide a fluid experience that’s simple to learn but hard to master.
