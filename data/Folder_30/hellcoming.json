    "About the game": "Hellcoming is a co-op horror survival game for 1-4 players, who need to clean large areas from hellish abomination with the help of special tools. SAVE YOUR WORLD ▸ HOW TO EXORCISE THE DEMON? You need to destroy the artifact that connects demon to your world; ▸ WHERE TO FIND ARTIFACT? You have to go through the portal to find the demon's shelter. There is a hellish altar with an artifact, but it's protected by runes; ▸ HOW TO DESTROY RUNES? Each rune relate to specific type of hellish abomination. Therefore, you need to cleanse unnatural things and kill hell creatures; ▸ WORK TOGETHER Help your friends escape from the imprisonment of demons. Watch your backs... and each others. Don't let them lock all players; SPECIAL TOOLS ▸ Vacuumer - picks up any liquids and has limited tank capacity; ▸ Brush - cleans up all kinds of dirt, but become dirty after a few cleanings; ▸ UV lamp - burns insects and hellish abomination, but overheats when operating; ▸ Shocker - kills medium-sized creatures and has limited amount of ammunitions; ▸ Bottle - fragile container with special liquid that extinguishes fire; ▸ Scanner - scans the location and displays the progress of cleanup on the monitor; ▸ EMF detector - helps you to find demonic creatures and objects; ▸ Medstation - creates injectors for healing players, if they wounded; ▸ Video cameras - you can watch some rooms from the monitor in your van; ITS HARDER THAN YOU THINK ▸ Stamina No one can run endlessly, even if he is running from a demon. Do not go far from the safe area. ▸ Big maps Each building has many rooms. Be careful while exploring the area and don't forget the path to the exit. ▸ Escalating difficulty Rage and speed of demon increases as the game progresses, as does the number of hellish creatures it spawn to stop you. ▸ Traps Watch your step. Traps may look harmless, but they can ruin your life. Warning! This game contains flashing lights that may make it unsuitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions.",
