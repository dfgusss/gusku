    "About the game": "In Your Realm gives an old-school, challenging, RPG roguelike experience with randomized encounters and a unique combat system. To beat the game the player needs to plow through every weakness of their personality - represented in the game as different bosses in their respective worlds - to finally take on the ultimate challenge. In Your Realm is in part a homage to classic titles such as Golden Axe, Mega Man and Zelda: A link to the past, where focus lies on challenging and fun gameplay with good replayability. Each of every one of the hundred of unique monsters in the game offers their own set of attacks and behaviors. Every decent run grants the player rewards to spend to introduce new elements and buffs in the next run. Altogether this makes every play a different experience. Features: 100 unique monsters. Skill tree that evolves based on: spells found, skills aquired, attributes leveled, bosses killed and your playstyle. Armors and weapons, displayed on the character. Randomized labyrinth of rooms and encounters/rewards in them. Characteristics gained by playing in a certain manner. These give specific bonuses/penalties in alignment with that playstyle. Extra lives when progressing beyond the first boss (in easy and normal difficulties). Activatable rewards after each decent run. Diplomas recording your best stats for each difficulty, such as: rooms explored, monsters killed, block% etc. Monsters fight back! (not mainly hack-n-slash or shoot-n-dodge gameplay)",
