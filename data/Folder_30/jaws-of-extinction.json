    "About the game": "HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO SURVIVE ONE MORE DAY? Jaws Of Extinction (JoE) is a story-driven, single-player, and multiplayer, horror-survival RPG. Your story begins on a large, open-world island known as Eden-Nadir; a place renowned for its beauty and thriving wildlife. You will be faced with decisions that you may not wish to make as you battle against terrifying infected locals, brutal armed survivors, dangerous native wildlife, exposure to the elements, and the threats posed by other players. Play single-player, co-op with up to 4 friends, or multiplayer on a dedicated server. Follow the storyline and uncover the dark secrets of Eden-Nadir or go off the beaten track and simply survive in the huge, open-world, hand-crafted environment. A CAPABLE THREAT The infected can do almost everything you can do—climb, vault, run, and even open doors. To get an edge, players must use stealth, cunning and the appropriate equipment to survive. CLASSIC DESIGN, NEW HORROR The infected are not reanimated undead. They are conscious and completely aware of what is happening, but have no control over their actions. Screaming in pain, they are slaves to the fungal parasite seen protruding from wounds on their bodies. HEADSHOTS? ROOKIE MISTAKE! Headshots will spread a cloud of hazardous fungal spores. The best way to eliminate the infected is by damaging the heart. Take mercy on them. FEAR THE RAIN Infected are attracted to water and become extremely dangerous when exposed to it. Every trip to a reliable watering hole carries risk, and be wary of straying too far from safety when dark clouds are overhead. The skies will betray you in other ways too. Beware of flocks of carrion birds that will give away your position. IMMERSE YOURSELF! What will be your profession? You can build, craft, trade, farm, hunt, fight, scavenge, loot, ambush and steal… it’s all up to you! How will you choose to survive? EXPLORE AND CLAIM VAST LANDSCAPES The island of Eden-Nadir’s diverse biomes range from sweeping lavender and cornfields to sun-dappled forests and beautiful seashores which feed into murky swamps. If you're looking to settle in a more urban environment, then the island is dotted with deserted towns, fortified cities, even quaint villages and picturesque countryside retreats. All waiting to be claimed.",
