    "About the game": "Joshua's Legs is a strange game about a two-legged arachnid hoping to find his long lost prosthetic legs collection. Venture in a world that will only reveal its secrets to the true hardened climbers. Follow the marked path or explore the lair to find all of Joshua’s prostheses. Those will allow him to jump, grip and shoot webs to swing or prevent free fall. A modern homage to the hardest platformers created Key Features: Rewire your brain to crawl, climb and jump like a biped. Control legs individually with the joysticks. Explore the lair however you want and at your own pace. Collect spider webs to increase your web shooter capacity. Discover new secret areas with your improved reach. Test your skills in speed, finesse, precision and consistency in the final level, procedurally generated and always different with each try. Find one-use webs along the way to help you progress further and further. Listen to an original soundtrack by author Danielle Tremblay. It will help you find your way around this strange world. Warning: This game's difficulty is considerably higher than traditional platformers. It features controls that take more effort to master than most games. It can take up to 1 or 2 hours of playtime for the controls to feel more natural. Some optional areas might even only be accessible to a few naturally gifted players.",
