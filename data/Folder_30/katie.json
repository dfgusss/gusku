    "About the game": "Now with full Vive VR support! An isolated town. Dozens of ensnared citizens. Each with their own thoughts, each with their own reasons for ending up here. But only one will listen. Find her . Katie, at it's core, is a game about understanding. About talking, dwelling, thinking. Walk around, speak to people, explore the town, uncover secrets (if that's your thing), and listen to Katie. Written during a time of immense personal transition, Katie is a casual yet vulnerable reflection on friendship, dealing with loss, and the pursuit of meaning in the midst of chaos. It's an expression of mind laid bare in a vicarious manner, and a narrative of a life on the verge of sanity. Features A fully realized, living, 3D pixel-art town, cut off from the rest of society and ready for exploration. Dozens of handmade citizens, each with their own look and Idea that they're willing to express. Talk to them, ignore them, or let them be. A vulnerable narrative that unfolds over a week as you interact with the individual that gave this game it's namesake, and seek to understand what drives the heart of the town. Walk around, look around, be around. Secret, post-game content. Fully movable swings (to relive your elementary days). 'What are you running from?'",
