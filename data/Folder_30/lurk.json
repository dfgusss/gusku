You're put in the shoes of Mercer, a sellsword scout whose company of mercenaries is slaughtered by an unknown demonic force. As the only surviving member of your company, you must guide Mercer to find out what killed your brothers in arms and seek vengeance for their deaths. A dark forest shrouded in the blanket of night, a labyrinth of rocky crags housing unseen horrors, and a dimension of pure torment are just some of the terrifying environments you will find yourself in as you explore the expanse of the Farlands. Demons, monstrosities, and terrors of all kinds roam the land, forcing you to ration supplies and survive at all costs. Experience true fantasy horror now in the world of Lurk .",
