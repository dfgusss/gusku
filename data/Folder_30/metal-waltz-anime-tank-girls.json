Background story In 194X, human created a new creature, which were combined with animals and tank components, called Beast Tanks. This new kind of creature had amazing power, they were controlled via radio waves. Beast Tanks can be used for agricultural production and other production activities, of course, including war. However, one day human suddenly lost control of the Beast Tanks. The runaway Beast Tanks conducted destruction everywhere in the whole world, brought the human being an unprecedented catastrophe... ... Metal Maidens are the only hope of the human being to defeat the Beast Tanks. Metal Maidens is the product of the Walküre Project, which aims to transform humans in a similar fashion to Beast Tanks; with the same capabilities or better. Metal Maiden technology is divided into two types -- Body modification and Attires. Body Modification --A Metal Maiden core (an improved Beast Tank core) is implanted into the body, vastly improving the human body's limits and expanding neural networks to allow for control of external armor and appendages. Attires -- Armored combat attires similar to a Beast Tank's, developed as a robust and reliable armor utilizing their new capabilities; however, some attires are specifically developed for and only correspond to a specific type of Metal Maiden core. As a side note: Men are, for some mysterious reason, unable to utilize any core at all, but not all women are able to as well; so both the selection and testing are rigorous and stringent. Some scholars believe the Metal Maidens are a new kind of creature. Some say that the Metal Maidens technique will lead to the fundamental change in mankind.
