    "About the game": "“We all have a little darkness inside of us.” It’s always so easy to bury secrets in small towns. Especially when the authority turns a blind eye. Just as you moved back to your childhood town, an unfortunate chain of events leads you to a series of mysterious cases buried away by the locals. Your friends seem just as clueless as you are … Or are they? Guided by only the vaguest clues and instinct, your task is to find the missing pieces of bizarre cases that seem to involve more and more people you know as you go along. As time progresses, you must choose: Either to stay ignorant, enjoy your last year of High School blissfully and hope for the best, or dive head-first into detective mode and claw your way out. Missing Time is all about making connections between the most important details of your life, and to never miss any moment that can define or destroy memories that will follow you always. Heavily story-driven, Missing Time is a beautiful concoction of horror and utsuge, that will surely leave an impression no matter the decision you make. Features: 175,000+ words (15-25 hours) 110+ BGs and 25+ CGs 4 character routes and 8+ endings 1 secret route Characters Chiharu Ichihara Your shy and bubbly childhood friend.
