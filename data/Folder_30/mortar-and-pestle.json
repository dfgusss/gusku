    "About the game": "Isn't it fascinating how you can mix a bunch of plants and other random objects to create a potion which can change pretty much anything? Well now you can be an alchemist and do just that. Well not in real life (because it will probably end up badly) but you can pretend that you're a real life alchemist and it will be just as good. With multiple levels and difficulties, each one having unique ingredients, you can create many different types of concoctions. From a small vial of weakness to a large potion of health with more variants waiting to be added. Key Features 12 levels (more coming) 3 difficulties (Easy, Normal and Hard) 52 unique ingredients (more coming) Achievements for your progress (none implemented yet) Please note that this is in its very early stages and the content is very limited. However updates are being worked on daily so it's up to you whether you would like to purchase this game now or give it some time first. Don't worry, I won't be upset or anything.",
