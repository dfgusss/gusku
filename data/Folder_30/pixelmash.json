    "About the game": "Pixelmash allows artists and game makers to craft pixel art and animations using a completely new technique, based on painting or importing an image in a high-resolution layer, while non-destructively pixelizing and applying other layer effects to create incredible pixel art. This makes several traditionally difficult pixel art tasks much easier: Making outlines, shading, and dithering easily adjustable by having them applied non-destructively as layer effects. Creating animations using layer transforms (rather than having to paint every frame pixel-by-pixel). Easily creating different resolutions and color variants of the same image. Converting photos or other hi-res artwork into pixel art using layer effects and the resolution slider. And much more! It's a brilliant new art tool for game makers, artists, hobbyists, kids, and lovers of the 8-bit and 16-bit era.",
