    "About the game": "'It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.' In early autumn 1811, two eminently eligible gentlemen come to stay near Longbourn, the home of Elizabeth Bennet and her sister Jane. Thus begins Jane Austen's enduring masterpiece of manners and romance. So too begins An Austen Armoire, a cozy game that invites Austen fans of all ages to play, read, make, and share in the world of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. An Austen Armoire is an illuminated novel--a time-based casual game wrapping like a cozy shawl around Volume 1 of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It offers ongoing cosplay fun through timed item drops, while immersing the player in the mannered world of the Regency through daily character messages and historical fun facts. The interactive experience is timed to Pride and Prejudice story events in an 1811 calendar. Actual gameplay unfolds over the course of 86 real days. Play a few minutes each day simply to unlock new messages and cosplay items--there's something new to discover each day! Or take a few more minutes to immerse yourself in highly readable novelogues. Enjoy the original Pride and Prejudice Volume 1 as blog-length episodes formatted to suit modern reading habits on screens. Snack or binge--the choice is yours! Play in a story you love INDULGE in relaxing cosplay with Elizabeth and Jane Bennet paper-dolls. Players eventually unlock ~140 pieces of Regency fashion--from dresses and spencers, bonnets and gloves, to recreations of Jane Austen's own jewelry. RELAX in Elizabeth and Jane's sitting room as the events of Volume 1 unfold in characters' letters, story teasers, and historical references. MAKE KEEPSAKES of your favorite looks in customizable and shareable tableau-style portrait cards. Save image files that you can share. SAVOR Volume 1 of Jane Austen's classic novel, presented in snack-sized novelogues for easy reading on devices. (BYO cup of tea.) A novel interactive experience An Austen Armoire has no ads or interruptions, and no internet connection is required after the game has been installed. Volume 1 of Austen's Pride and Prejudice takes place between Michaelmas and Christmas 1811. Expected game duration is therefore 86 real days, and gameplay items unlock over the course of daily play sessions. Players start the game with about 30 cosplay items. An Austen Armoire ends with well over 100 items unlocked by 'Christmas 1811.' Laptop or desktop mouse is recommended for playing An Austen Armoire. At this time, An Austen Armoire does not have a Developer's Recommended Configuration for play with a controller.",
