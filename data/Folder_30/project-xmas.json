The map on which you will play is completely procedurally generated so every approach to complete the game will be differend and specific. The game have really creepy sound engine so it's highly recommended to play with headphones to hear that something is follow you... Your main objective is to return to your home... but you have limited battery and energy... The game have good graphics style like old VHS tapes vibe, so the atmosphere of the game is really specific and horrible. The game have First Person point of view, it's highly recommended to play with headphones. Your only weapon is your hearing and flashlight... Project XMAS is created by only one person - Mistyczny Arbuz. I'm creating this game since 3 months and it's still in development stage.",
