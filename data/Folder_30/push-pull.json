    "About the game": "Push Pull is a challenging 2D puzzle game. You play as Push and Pull, and must work together through a series of simple looking, yet challenging puzzles in an unknown test facility. Will you persevere and discover what purpose this testing serves? Includes over 40 levels and multiple puzzle mechanics. Important Notes for Co-op (Shared Screen): Push Pull was designed as a single player game. However, as you control two characters the majority of the game could be played as a shared screen co-op game.",
