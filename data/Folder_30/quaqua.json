    "About the game": "Calling all Duck Devotees. Do you love puzzle games? Do you love ducks? Of course, you do! Then QuaQua (that's Aqua with a Quack) is the addictive duck game for you. The aim of the game is simple: run around as an adorable duck to grab the falling bubbles, then use the blocks and items to build terrain and stop as much water escaping from your island as possible! Catch bombs that threaten to blow up your dams, race against ever-increasing rains to score as many points as possible and survive for as long as you can. Face-off against one another in a Head-to-Head Match, or work together in Co-op Mode to set a world record. With seven beautiful worlds to unlock, an incredible soundtrack, 20 possible ducks and over 100 accessories, set your worry and stress aside in this tranquil gaming experience designed to relax with the power of wholesome duck and block cuteness! QuaQua is a solo developed project created by indie developer Tyrone Anderson of Devoke Studio. The music for the game was written by Kyle Misko.",
