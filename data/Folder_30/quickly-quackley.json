It’s time to get out of bed and get gainfully employed! With his go-getter attitude, our hero lines up a series of job interviews to leap into the workforce. Only one problem… ...He’s late. Quickly, Quackley! Is a fast-paced 2D precision platformer with a distinctly 80’s aesthetic.

FEATURES: 48 levels, split across 8 uniquely themed worlds A retro-inspired ZX Spectrum aesthetic ‘Speedrun’ mode with an in-game timer ‘Practice’ mode to familiarise yourself with each level ‘Time Trial’ mode to drive your own self-improvement Full controller support Accessibility options for colour and visual effects Achievements! Cutscenes! A thumping techno soundtrack! A duck!",
