    "About the game": "Seven years after the destruction of her home, Olenine wanders the land as an exorcist, a specialist who harnesses spiritual essences to confront supernatural forces. Yet with her rare knowledge of inhuman languages, she strives to settle conflicts through words rather than violence. Tasked with rescuing an influential merchant’s daughter from Gremach, a fortress besieged by ghouls, Olenine must use knowledge, power, and diplomacy to unravel a grudge spanning generations. When plunged into a maze of unspeakable secrets—including her own—can she bring peace to both the living and the dead? ・A Canadian-produced visual novel featuring a rich cast of characters, a dark fantasy setting, and a roughly 3-hour storyline (~55k words) ・Your choices will determine the course of Olenine’s journey with multiple branching paths and two possible finales; experience both to unlock an additional epilogue ・30+ expressive character sprites, 17 pieces of background art, and 19 special illustrations ・15 original music tracks",
