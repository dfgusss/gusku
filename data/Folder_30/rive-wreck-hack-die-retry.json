    "About the game": "RIVE is the metal wrecking, robot hacking shooter you've been waiting for! This 360-degree shooter/platformer hybrid lets you choreograph a ‘dance of destruction’ in insanely spectacular battles and set-pieces. RIVE feels like the explosive games of yore, pumping megapixels in true 21st century style. Endless variety: fight on land, underwater, in zero gravity or on a moving train! Gather hacks and control your enemies. Upgrade your spider tank's special attacks, armor and loot magnet. A 6+ hour campaign, voiced by Mark Dodson (Star Wars &amp; Gremlins). A deep story featuring our hero Roughshot, robot butlers, space loot and... clean teeth. Prove your mettle in the extra Speedrun and Single-Credit modes. Dozens of on-line leaderboards to compete in. Keep playing with the daily Challenges and infinite Battle Arenas. About hacking: Ever dreamed of controlling your enemies? In RIVE you can. Find the hacks and get those gun turrets, nurse drones and irritable smashbots on your side. Or kickstart and hitch a ride on top of a bullet train! About the story: When space scavenger Roughshot gets trapped on a mysterious starship, he has to form a surprising alliance. Don't care about the story? Just shoot the messenger. Literally.",
