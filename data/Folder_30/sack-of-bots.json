    "About the game": "Note from the developer Sack of Bots is a little labor of love. I always wanted to make my own small game and I have had a blast creating this and subsequently playing it, it has been very educational. I hope you will enjoy it too. Thank you for taking the time too read this. Have fun playing! Martijn Folmer Description : Sack of Bots is a top down, score-chasing arcade shooter. Use one of your 4 cars to drift around hordes of bots and blast them away. Keep your score multiplier up as you slide, crash and crunch through a variety of bots in this simple shoot 'em up. Improve your score and last as long as possible in the onslaught. Features : 4 different cars too satiate your thirst for bot decimation An infinite amount of bots too crunch through An artstyle which I would charitably call 'minimalistic' 17 achievements Steam cloud save",
