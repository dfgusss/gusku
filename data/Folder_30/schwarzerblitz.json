    "About the game": "'Indie fighter Schwarzerblitz pays tribute to early ’90s 3D fighters' - Shoryuken 'Schwarzerblitz shows love to early polygonal fighters' - Siliconera Schwarzerblitz is a love letter to '90s 3D low-poly fighters, featuring 27 playable characters, more than 30 stages, ring out mechanics, classic arcade endings, and a complete story mode. Steel your fists and let the Black Lightning strike! Story It's 2065 and the world is not what we used to know. Fennoscandia has sunk deep into the ocean, half of Ireland is ridden by haemophages, nuclear power has been replaced by reality-distorsion-resonance (RDR) power plants, and an alien planetoid has made first contact for more than fifty years, by now. In 2064, a major accident shook the whole Europe: Euterpe, the Italian capitol city, was razed by an explosion of incredible power, followed by a storm of black lightnings. The accounts of the witnesses diverged and no light was shed on the real cause of the disaster. After a one-year manhunt, the Delta Team has finally found a consistent trail, which leads directly to a secret governative project known as Schwarzer Blitz , 'the black lightning'... Game Mechanics five button system: Guard, Punch, Kick, Tech and Trigger fluid combo system: most attacks can chain into each other, leading to long strings and combos impact attacks: send your opponent flying with powerful blows - if near the border of the stage, this will throw them out of the ring trigger attacks: by using a bullet counter, the next attack will break the opponent's guard and increases the hitstun, leading to easier combos and humongous damage trigger guard / combo breaker: when comboed, you can use a bullet counter to cancel the hitstun and strike back against your opponent Main Features 27 playable characters A total of more than 100 skins (circa 4 per character) 39 different stages with animated background elements and ring out mechanics arcade, survival, time-attack... you name it! 5h long story mode with several CG cutscenes, and an overarching story joining all arcade endings together gallery mode, arcade ending theater extensive training mode with frame advantage data, tutorials and trials local multiplayer, both with joypad or split-keyboard 8-way movement in a complete 3D environment extended movelists for every character, listing every possible chain varied soundtrack with different genres and tunes moddable game engine (workshop support planned) controls can be freely remapped in-game.
