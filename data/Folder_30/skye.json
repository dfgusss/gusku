    "About the game": "Welcome to SKYE! A flight game where you explore a beautiful painterly island group, inspired by the Scottish Hebrides. In SKYE you explore the land in your trusty seaplane. You can land your plane anywhere on the water and visit the local port to pick up quests. The surrounding environment allows for you to maneuver through rock arches, to pass rock formations and to soar island peaks. The quests from the locals challenge you to guide ships, follow other airplanes, pick-up goods and to set the fastest times in races! You can also explore and experience the world at your own pace and allow yourself to be distracted by collectibles, can you find them all? The world of SKYE has a painterly effect which gives it a unique look. The beautiful world is crafted with attention to each of its features: whether it's the waters surrounding the islands, the steep rock cliffs or the green plains filled with flowers. SKYE is created by a team of 3rd year game development students from Breda University of Applied Sciences (formerly known as NHTV) with the soundtrack provided by Alex Tosh. After four months of active development, preceded by half a year of concepting, we are excited to finally be sharing our game on Steam! Join our Discord Community today!",
