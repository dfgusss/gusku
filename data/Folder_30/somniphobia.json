    "About the game": "Somniphobia: causes extreme anxiety and fear around the thought of going to bed. This phobia is also known as hypnophobia, clinophobia, sleep anxiety, or sleep dread. Somniphobia is a single player physiological survival horror game, where you’re in control of Susan's nightmares. Her nightmares are filled with past traumas and bad memories. You must keep those thoughts and nightmarish figments of her imagination away from you, since once they get too close, Susan will wake up, and she’ll have the same dream again. You must think , and try out different ideas if you are to survive all of Susan’s nightmares. You'll have to crawl through claustrophobic vents, creep down corridors, escape and survive in a nightmarish, hand-painted world of Susan's imagination. Crawl through claustrophobic vents Luckily this is still just a dream... however this means that sections of this cold dark, maze changes over time. Stay alert constantly! Monsters will creep up this hallway if you are not concentrating. Keep all of those nasty thoughts and memories away from you! Use 'cameras' to look into Susan's memories to keep track of where all the monsters are lurking. With only a small battery for your torch, a creature that moves towards you whenever you look behind yourself, and with the ability to only close off one vent at a time, you must carefully watch these unwanted memories to avoid wasting your resources... or getting jump scared!",
