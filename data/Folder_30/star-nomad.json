In Star Nomad, you roam free in the Wildlands Sector immersed in a sci-fi noir setting rich in depth and humor. While a sandbox at heart, it's also heavily story driven with a personal plot inspired by WW2 &amp; classic sci-fi/cyberpunk such as Blade Runner, Johnny Mnemonic &amp; Gundam that puts you right in the pilot seat to determine the outcome of an escalating corporate war! Star Nomad has a semi-permadeath system whereby you will lose your ship, but insurance will payout most of the ship value in credits.
