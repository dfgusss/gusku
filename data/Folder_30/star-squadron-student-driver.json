    "About the game": "You dreamed all your life about joining the ranks of Star Squadron, the famed interstellar supergroup of heroic, larger-than-life figures. Danger, intrigue and cosmic adventure await you- but first you'll need to pass your basic piloting exam. Until they can trust you with their multi-trillion credit spacecraft, you'll need to prove yourself in this T71 Kestral, a rather care-worn training craft whose only weapon shoots ping pong balls. Yes, it's a tad under-powered but the T71 more than makes up for this with rustic charm. You'll love it. After the 'incident' during an earlier attempt, Squadron officials have set up a series of driving test courses in a seemingly harmless derelict space freighter. What could go wrong? Naturally, it would be decidedly non-ideal for you to run into hostile life forms. We ran a scan and are 90% sure-ish that you won't see any. If you do, maybe you can find a way to dispatch them passively. You'll figure it out- or maybe you won't. How exciting! Zip around through fifteen exciting levels over 5 separate environoments in your quest for the Star Squadron Pilot's License. Find the hidden tokens in each stage to open up later courses. One request: please do try not to die. It results in a lot of cumbersome admin and could result in damage to the T71. Also, your demise would go down on your permanent record, so yeah, try to avoid dying.",
