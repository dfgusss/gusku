    "About the game": "You Have The Conn If you've ever wanted to sit in the Captains chair... This game is for you! Horizons is a multi-player experience allowing 2-6 players to work together as Bridge Officers. This game is designed to be played as a team, venturing around the galaxy or playing any number of Missions designed for a shorter experience. One License Supports Up Six Players One copy of the game will server as the Main View Screen (like you see in Star Trek) and allow up to 6 players locally to join from their devices as one of the key Bridge Officers: Captain, Flight, Tactical, Science, Operations, and Engineering. Use your PC, Laptop, Tablet, Chromebook or even Raspberry Pi to connect and play! Add additional screens like Alert Status, Shield Status, Galactic Maps and more to further add to the fun! Advanced Hardware Support Build your own bridge with lighting and immersive effects! Horizons natively supports external devices like DMX, Philips hue, Z-Wave and even networked Arduino or Raspberry Pi devices. Steam Workshop Support for Steam Workshop will be added in the future to allow the community to add and share their own content.",
