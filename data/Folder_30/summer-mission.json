    "About the game": "[Story outline] A story about going back to the past and trying to make up with 'Sayuri,' who broke up a week ago. The stage begins in December 2021 with Sayuri's funeral. Towa, the main character, received a 'ticket that allows him to go back to the past for only three days' from a mysterious woman wearing Gothic Lolita. However, the destination of the time slip was the summer of 1980. Sayuri was still 15 years old, the same as Towa. In addition, Sayuri loves 'Student Organization Inside School (Rei)' instead of 'Grandpa (Seige)' . 'I wouldn't be born as it is !?' ~~~~~~~ [3D animation] This game consists of 3 parts. ・ 3D animation ・ 3D exploration ・ 2D novel Above all, the 3D animation part is a must-see. Motion capture is used for face and hand movements. Please enjoy the production as if the character is actually speaking and the small changes in facial expressions. Don't miss the voices of the four voice actors and the last impression. ~~~~~~~ [Sub-event with townspeople] Apart from the main story, there will be submissions to help people in need. There are 12 submissions in all, and you can enjoy interacting with all 30 townspeople. (example) Events with the theme of 'disco' and 'song programs' that are conscious of the historical background of 1980, etc. ~~~~~~~ [Three endings] On the night of the first day, the story changes greatly depending on 'who will stay' among 'Sayuri', 'Seige', and 'Rei'. The story ends in three ways. Can Towa really make up with Sayuri ...? Play time: 2-3 hours",
