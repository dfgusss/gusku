    "About the game": "TEMPLE of RUBBO is a fast co-op dungeon crawler for 1 to 4 players. A shipwrecked crew of cursed pirates are condemned to an animal form... Armed with nothing but their desire to be human again, they decide to enter... the TEMPLE of RUBBO. Delve deep into the dungeon below and fight rats, slimes, goblins, knights and demons. Use swords, spears, bows and magic through 16 floors of dungeons to rescue the ancient wizard! Can you lift the curse from your crew? Features 📺 Play co-op with 1-4 players 🔎 Explore 5 unique areas 🏛️ Procedurally generated dungeons - different each time! 🎁 120 items to find 🗡️ Over 30+ enemies to fight 👛 4 different kinds of shops 😈 4 bossfights and 4 minibosses 🦊 10 playable characters 🎵 Original Soundtrack of over 15 songs by @bbtombo! 🕒 3+ hours of playtime Pick-up and play 🎮 The game is very easy to get in to: with only three buttons and a clear objective, you can get all your friends playing in just a couple of minutes. No tedious tutorial to get through! New run, new build! 🧙‍♀️ Each run, you'll come across shops, witches and a blacksmith which you can use to buy gear and level up your character. Will you become a powerful knight, a swift archer or an intelligent battle mage? It's all up to you! Fast-paced Fun ⏳ The game is very fast paced: you only have three minutes before each floor begins to disintegrate. It's stressful, but it also means that a full run will not take you longer than about 45 minutes! Co-op 🙎‍♂️🙎 You can play TEMPLE of RUBBO with up to 4 players! If you have no controllers, it's 1-2 players. If you do, you can either use 4 controllers, or mix-and-match with keyboard players if you don't have enough. No-one around? The game is balanced in such a way that it is also a lot of fun to play on your own! Sokpop makes a new game every month! Subscribe for 3$ per month at",
