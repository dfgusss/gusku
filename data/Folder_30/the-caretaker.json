    "About the game": "Survive this nightmarish aftermath by exploring Red Chapel Town. Search your way through its streets and buildings for anything you can use to keep you alive and to keep you moving. Fight your way through hideous creatures hellbent on making you their next meal all while uncovering what the hell happened… They let you out of your cell… they didn’t even tell you why. There's a cloud of black and grey filling the sky and the emergency siren is deafening. No one even cares that you’re there, like you don’t even exist. They all seem so… preoccupied. Cars are turned over, some even on fire. Blood stains on the walls and concrete too. What do you care… they opened the door… now your free … - Search streets, alleyways, yards, buildings, and sewers to find needed items and answers. - Make your way through Red Chapel by deciphering puzzles and using hidden key items. - Blast through hideous and unnatural creations through a mix of gun play and quick thinking.",
