    "About the game": "As a young, new arrival in Breckenridge, Colorado in the 1860’s, the only job you can find is to guard each day’s newly mined gold at the local mine each night. Unfortunately, the mythical creatures known as Tommyknockers that keep the mine’s riches safe from outsiders are determined to take all that mined gold back, and with a vengeance! While the gold could easily be taken from the mine to the nearest town each day, scavengers, thieves and bandits in the area are relentless and the only safe place the miners have left is inside the mine itself, due to the fact that everyone knows about the Tommyknockers and NO ONE dares mess with the evil and dangerous creatures. This is where YOU come in: with very limited supplies, do you dare keep the gold safe overnight from these terrifying Tommyknockers, inside the very mine where they dwell? Can you succeed where all others have not only failed, but died horribly? Defend the gold and yourself throughout the night from the Tommyknockers in a haunted Colorado mine! Setup a defensive perimeter with bear traps Throw rocks to scare away, injure and hopefully kill the Tommyknockers or at least keep them at a safe distance Use a candle-burning lantern to illuminate the pitch black darkness and scare away the Tommyknockers, but beware, candles and matches are extremely limited each night! You WILL be in the dark for part of each night! The more gold you keep safe from the Tommyknockers each night, the more supplies you can buy from the General Store each day to help you survive the next night!",
