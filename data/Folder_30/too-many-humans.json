    "About the game": "You are Phthisis, the God of pestilence, decay and death. Humanity has degraded too far into greed and is causing irreversible damage to Gaia; your dear sister, and their planet. Something has to be done. But like every god, you have rules (omnipotence gets boring otherwise): you are not allowed to directly kill humans. But you *can* raise them back from the dead. And if the living ones die because of this... Eh *shrug*. Rise, mutate and unleash your Zombies into frantic battles against the treacherous humans. Fight every battle to break one by one the chains of avarice humanity has binded itself with. Gameplay YOU are the horde : Rise and send armies of Zombies to fight the good war. Lead the horde : Zombies aren't very clever and need to be kept on a tight leash. Original Controls: Lead your armies with simplified Real Time Tactic-Action controls Mutate : your zombies into various different Zombies to counter humans. Respawn : Humans die once, but Zombies never die! Scare : Unleash Zombies at humans and make them 'wet' their pants! Chaos : Leave a trail of blood and destruction in your path. Physics : Ragdoll your Zombies into the air (because that's always awesome!). Leaderboards : Play recklessly or strategically to top the leaderboards. Real-Time Tactics Controls Lead your Zombies with original controls adapted to easily dispatch many waves of Zombies, many times. You won't be micromanaging single units here! Chapter 1 : ZOMBIE RISING Play through 7 unique hand-crafted missions that will take you places and do Zombie stuff! Who really is the Zombie of today?",
