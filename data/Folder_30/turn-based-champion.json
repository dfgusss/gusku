Turn-Based Champion is a local multiplayer RPG-BoardGame-PartyGame-VideoGame hybrid where you compete against monsters in turn-based battle and your friends in minigames to become the Champ! Master minigames or defeat bosses to stack up your trophies and earn the crown! Key Features: Local multiplayer and single player Three total maps Fifteen total minigames (with more planned) Unlockable costumes and content Cute aesthetic and soundtrack Dozens of opportunities to piss off your friends (It is highly recommended to play Turn-Based Champion with a controller, although playing on a keyboard is possible by using the arrow keys and 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys. For the best experience use a usb controller.)",
