    "About the game": "Welcome to UNDERTALE. In this RPG, you control a human who falls underground into the world of monsters. Now you must find your way out... or stay trapped forever. ((Healthy Dog's Warning: Game contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition.)) features: Killing is unnecessary: negotiate out of danger using the unique battle system. Time your attacks for extra damage, then dodge enemy attacks in a style reminiscent of top-down shooters. Original art and soundtrack brimming with personality. Soulful, character-rich story with an emphasis on humor. Created mostly by one person. Become friends with all of the bosses! At least 5 dogs. You can date a skeleton. Hmmm... now there are 6 dogs...? Maybe you won't want to date the skeleton. I thought I found a 7th dog, but it was actually just the 3rd dog. If you play this game, can you count the dogs for me...? I'm not good at it.",
