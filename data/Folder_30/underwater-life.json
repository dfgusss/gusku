    "About the game": "Underwater Life is an indie simulator game made in 2D graphics with pleasant musical accompaniment. Many are interested in the question, what kind of life is it at the bottom of the ocean? Is everything there as good as it seems? Whether all of its inhabitants enjoy life and swim for their own pleasure. Or the opposite is true - the little ones hide from the big ones, and the big ones hunt the little ones, trying in this way to survive. This game will reveal all the secrets of the seabed and show you the real life of a fish from start to finish. You will go all the way from the birth of the fry to its transformation into a large, beautiful fish. Plunge into a beautiful and colorful underwater world with a wide variety of fish, learn all its secrets. You start the game as a small fish that needs to eat a lot in order to grow and become big and strong. But, as elsewhere in nature, the strongest overcomes the weaker. Therefore, try to eat only that fish that is smaller than yours, otherwise you will lose. Be careful, some fish can swim very quickly and you don't even have time to blink before they eat you. You can play the game either alone or together. Are you ready to conquer the seabed with your friends? Eat fish, grow in size, become the top link in the food chain so that no one can beat you. Enjoy your game!",
