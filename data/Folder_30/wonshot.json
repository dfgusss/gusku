    "About the game": "Story It's your first day at the Galactic Federation of Several Planets, and your job is to destroy as many enemy ships as possible with a giant laser. Seems simple enough. The federation seems nice enough, but it does feel a little strange that they can be so cheerful about causing such wanton destruction. Well, as long as you get paid it will be fine. Right? Gameplay Like the name implies in wonShot you get ONE shot. One shot each level to find the perfect spot to fire your laser and blow up as many enemy ships as you possibly can. Create massive chain reactions with numerous types of bombs, ships, and environmental hazards to utterly annihilate the rebel fleet. Be careful though, you need to reach a minimum score per level or you WILL be terminated. Features - 99 playable levels. - 3 unique game modes - Various power-ups and bonus objects scattered throughout each level. - Amazing pixel art portraits for NPC characters who guide you through the campaign. - Global leaderboards - Extreme explosions!",
