    "About the game": "World Enduro Rally is the best enduro racing game available. With more than 100k players in other platforms, World Enduro Rally now arrives to Steam! Beat your friends' best times in amazing locations such as China, Yosemite National Park, Iguazú Falls or The Golden Gate in San Francisco. Race through canyons in Australia, test your skills in the most wonderful glaciers of Argentina, or immerse yourself in the most beautiful forests of Spain. Key Features: ✔ Awesome graphics ✔ Very realistic physics ✔ Real bike and quad models: 125cc, 250cc, 450cc... 2-Stroke and 4-Stroke engines ✔ Amazing worldwide locations ✔ Leaderboards and achievements ✔ In-game Camera feature to take pictures ✔ Game-pad and keyboard support ✔ Available in English and Spanish Enduro racing is a somewhere between MX and Trials sports. You ride in outdoor locations on a time-based race. The goal is to complete each round as fast as possible, but World Enduro Rally will give you bonus time if you perform stunts like backflips, frontflips (and other hidden stunts), and will add penalty time each time you re-spawn. Enduro bikes are heavy, and controlling tilt is sometimes hard. They don't brake much either, so you need to plan your speed carefully. The game includes speed signs to give you tips about when you can drive fast, or when you should drive slowly. More bikes and locations will keep coming! We’re on Twitter (@WEnduroRally) and Facebook (@worldEnduroRally).",
