    "About the game": "This is a VR experience which shows how virtual reality can invoke an involuntary response. I created the first scene - the canyon - as I wanted to demonstrate the effect to friends without having to guide them through a game to a suitable point. It was so effective I wanted to expand on it. This is very much aimed at being an experience you can keep in your library and bring out to show new users - it isn't a game so there aren't any challenges in it, and will have less effect on veteran VR users. The current stationary scenes are: A wooden bridge over a canyon A narrow ledge on a cliff The top of a building in a city Being in a dark passageway with only a flip lighter Being trapped underground with the walls closing in In the ocean surrounded by sharks On a window cleaning gondola on the side of a skyscraper There are also scenes which include player movement: Performing a base jump Swinging round a city with grappling hooks",
