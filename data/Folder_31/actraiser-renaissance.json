New stories, expanded action and realm management gameplay, additional action stages, an all-new realm, and a new, powerful boss! Auto-save and difficulty levels Realm Acts: Strategically cast powerful fire, ice, and other magic in these 2D action stages.

You will need every new trick in your arsenal to defeat stronger bosses at the end of the new action stages. Realm Management: Help humanity flourish by cultivating your settlements and offering guidance. Use your miraculous powers to summon lightning and trigger earthquakes to remove obstacles such as trees and boulders that impede the growth of your chosen. Play as the Lord of Light's angel and use your mighty bow and arrows to drive back the evil monsters that prey on your people. Protect your settlements from enemy raids in real-time strategic battles. The placement of your forts and timing of your miracles is key to achieving victory in these engagements. Experience all-new tales of humanity's struggles to overcome their flaws and failings as they learn to love one another and together grow stronger. Altogether, these new scenarios amount to more than twice the story present in the original. Explore the vast new realm and enjoy building your settlements for longer than ever before!
