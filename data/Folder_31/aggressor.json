    "About the game": "The game Aggressor is a stylized, physics-based air combat Shoot 'Em Up. It's all about defeating the enemy and watching them go down in a blaze of glory. The player progresses by completing missions and destroying enemy aircraft. For those interested in quick action, there is an instant dogfight gamemode in which you can rapidly configure your own battles. The game features 30+ player-flyable aircraft. The list of aircraft is ever expanding. The majority of the roster is made up of classic cold-war era fighters but also many lesser known prototypes and fictional planes with unique flight controls. It is important to know that some of the aircraft are still out of reach/too expensive with the current total number of missions simply not providing enough cash to purchase these. This will get solved soon as the campaign gets expanded, and more importantly, new gamemodes are added. Setting The game is set around the cold war time period, and features aircraft/weapons from that era. By completing missions, new weapons can be unlocked and equipped. A wide variety of weapons are available in the loadout editor. From gunpods to bombs to air-to-air missiles, there are lots of ways to defeat your opponents in spectacular fashion. State of the game As you may have noticed, Aggressor is currently in early access. This means not all of the content and features are in place yet! I've recently gotten to the point where I can start adding more content without too much risk of breaking stuff, thus I will be doing so consistently until the game is complete in my eyes. This is also a good time for player feedback and suggestions for things to add. Currently there are only 6 missions, 4 of which are part of the training campaign. Controls Controls are true to life, this means that in order to turn, you have to use both roll and pitch like you would behind the controls of a real aircraft. No point and shoot, you fly the aircraft and are given full and precise control over it's motion. Flight physics are simulated allowing you to perform all combat manuevers. Damage Model Aircraft in the game feature a relatively complex damage model. Every aircraft is divided into parts which are connected through physics joints. These parts each run their own damage calculations. The full list of damage-related features is a long one but here are some prominent ones: Fuel tanks can rupture and/or catch on fire Parts can be shot off, disintegrate and/or explode Lift/drag changes from damage to aerodynamic surfaces Powerplant failures Hydraulic failures Jammed control surfaces Structural failure CHECK DISCORD FOR THE LATEST ON AGGRESSOR!",
