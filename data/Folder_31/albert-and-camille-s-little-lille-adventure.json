This is a casual educational game and should only last around 10 minutes to play through. Explore the city, work with the people of Little Lille, avoid the soldiers, and collect the necessary supplies Albert and Camille need to create the first vaccine to fight tuberculosis. As you progress, you will learn about the methods used to create BCG and how vaccines work. Who are the games for?: The game is totally free and can be played or downloaded by anyone with an internet connection. They are specifically targeted at 11 - 14 years old students and designed as a tool for teachers, researchers, and parents looking for a fun way to engage young people with the topics of immunology, vaccines and the history of science.
