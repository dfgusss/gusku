    "Name": "Cat of Monte Cristo",
    "Release date": "Jul 7, 2021",
    "About the game": "A short RPG that is a parody based on the Count of Monte Cristo, with many liberties taken that make it not very close to the original story. It's got turn based combat. It's about 2-3 hours long, with a few boss fights in it. It has over 40 maps. There are some jokes and humor that make it really neat. It has a decent amount of characters from the 1844 novel. It's a pixel RPG based on everyone's favorite Alexander Dumas book, made in RPGmaker MZ.",
