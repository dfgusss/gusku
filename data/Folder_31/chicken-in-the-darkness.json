    "About the game": "The main character, a highschool student who lives in a dorm, plans with his friends to order a fried chicken and get delivered. By losing a game of rock-scissors-paper, our main character has to order and deliver it back to the dorm. Would he be able to get back with his chicken safely? The game 'Chicken in the darkness' is a roguelike-indie-horror game developed by 3 highschool students. The goal is to search around the whole school to get objectives done and soundly return to eat a fried chicken with his friends. Unlike other usual horror games, there are no save points which make the game challenging. Also, trying to clear hidden achievements with a variety of limits would be very hard. Can YOU clear this game 100%?",
