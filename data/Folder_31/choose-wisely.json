    "About the game": "STORY An unlikely gathering in a dark room... Why are three young ladies and a crude mercenary here together? Then it appears clear that the place they are in is full of dangers, that some things aren't what they seem, and that a superior force is going to play cat and mouse with them. You'll have to be mightier than the mighty, grittier than the gritty, trickier than the tricky, but in the end, YOU can decide who makes it out alive... if any. This game is a mystery RPG that will keep you on the edge of your seat with its plot and many twists. You can also play it in its story mode if you wish not to focus on the battles. FEATURES This game features no specific hero. You, as the player, can decide who makes it out alive. Your actions determine the outcome of the game. 9 characters with various fighting profiles, background and personalities (including some 18+ strong language) Huge interactivity. Almost 50 different party combinations and paths are possible. This affects the ending but also the conversations between the characters. About 4-5 hours length for one playthrough, more if you play it again to test other paths. This game offers a great deal of replayability. Mysterious and eerie atmosphere that will keep you guessing.
