    "About the game": "Tribeca Film Festival 2018 Official Selection There’s been no shortage of apocalyptic images lately, from massive hurricanes in the Caribbean and Texas to California’s deadliest wildfires ever. Scientists say global warming has magnified the impact of disasters like these. Still, some legislators deny the impact of climate change or oppose restrictions on carbon emissions. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a virtual reality experience is worth 1,000 pictures. Could virtual reality change their minds? In this 360 experience, travel to Palau, a small island nation in Micronesia, home to coral reefs that draw visitors from around the globe. Palau, like many other small countries, is powerless to curb global carbon dioxide emissions. See and experience how Palau is adapting to climate change to combat its effects on their reefs and economy. In the clear, warm waters surrounding Palau, exist resilient coral reefs and the will of a people fighting to keep it alive.",
