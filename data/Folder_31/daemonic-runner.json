    "About the game": "You run at high speed and attack enemies. The main point is to enjoy feeling of speed and your own dexterity. For me, just running forward is a pleasure itself. Moreover there's a gameplay which requires accuracy of your movements. I am a big fan of the old 90s games, and I tried to reproduce the graphic style of some games of that era. In general, I tried to make levels in the spirit of the first Quake, and to achieve the same feeling of a shotgun. Although this is not the main weapon in my game. In summing up, you may enjoy the game if you like fast running, feeling of speed and the action games in general. * A hard to master game with unusual gameplay. * Fast-paced, it requires good reflexes and dexterity. * Short, it only takes an hour or two to beat. * Software-rendered retro style graphics from the '90s.",
