    "About the game": "Welcome to the world of the Dynamite Bunny! He just LOVES explosions , and does no matter what to get to the carrot, BUT he has a little time left, because the carrot can go bad soon. Experience various cartoony levels filled with obstacles in the way, explosions, turrets trying to stop you from reaching the goal and finding the best and the fastest way to get to the carrot. Catch the Carrot update fulfills this experience even further by providing a totally different 'Unlimited Run' procedurally generated mode that shows how much the Bunny is really dreaming of the Carrot. In this mode Bunny is running to get the Carrot that he is imagining in front of him and you have to guide him through all the obstacles to fulfill his dream of getting closer and closer to the Carrot. Now there are three very different regions: A classic easier one to get you started A classic deadly one that only a few of the players are able to pass And the Catch The Carrot mode Customize the Bunny the way you like it with the unlockable skins: Game includes: A unique 3D platformer experience A range of carefully designed obstacles and ways to get to the end of the level A variety of unlockable skins for the Bunny Physics-based environment destruction Procedurally generated 'Unlimited Run mode' Statistics for every save game Various intense cartoony levels Very accessible and easy to learn but hard to master controls Lots of cute Bunny sounds",
