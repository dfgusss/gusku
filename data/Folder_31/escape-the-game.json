    "About the game": "Kevin is tired of being in this game. Can you help him escape? The game is heavily influenced from games like The Stanley Parable, Thomas was Alone and other story-driven games were choices you make matter. The game is about the comedy, tragedy, and drama in Kevin's escape. Through out the whole game, Kevin will constantly talk with you. Banter on choices you make and tell you about his plans. The game also includes a collection of gadgets with a unique twist to them - to break the game's boundaries. But the question still remains, is it even possible to escape? This is the introduction to a longer and larger game. Follow the development on twitter! @FredholmSimon",
