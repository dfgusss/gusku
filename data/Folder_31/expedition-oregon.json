    "About the game": "MORE LEVELS COMING SOON - Within the next week or so To colonize - to make or establish a colony - Mirriam Webster Dictionary. Sounds easy, right? Wrong. Your job at Oregon Industries is to be the forerunner of their colonization program, supplying spaceships, sending them into space, then fighting your way through a plethora of calamities that seek to destroy the blossoming colony. I mean, that's why they pay you the big bucks. Expedition Oregon is primarily a resource management simulator. You have to keep food high and death low. If you lose all your water, you lose. If you lose all your food, you lose. If you lose all the colonists, you lose. If you somehow manage to have some colonists survive, you will gain revenue from that planet, funding more projects. Think Oregon Trail - Space Edition, but with an interesting spin. Can you defeat the elements or will you fall to the horrors of space?",
