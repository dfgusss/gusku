    "About the game": "The wars were over. We had achieved dominance over all our enemies, and our influence stretched to the edges of known space. But as soon as our enemies bowed and acknowledged our lordship, murmurs were heard in the dark corners of our palaces and halls. Those who were not content to share the victory equally rose up to exert their influence over the government. The political parties that had been united while enemy armies ravaged our planets now turned on each other with blackest treachery. In this darkest twilight, we cannot sit idle. Take up control of our party's resources and reunite the State under our guiding vision! Choose from Deep and Unique Political Ideologies Will you fight for the Technocratists who wish to establish a meritocratic government where the most ruthless are allowed to exercise dominance, or for the Workerists who believe that the government should protect employees by ensuring all a company's products are purchased. In the distant future, today's politics of Democracy, Socialism, and Monarchy have been left aside as new beliefs replaced them. Build a Government As you invade each star system, you will need to set up a government infrastructure by recruiting officials. Use your prestige to build an efficient government that will let you rapidly expand. Conquer Your Opponents Expand against your enemies as you maneuver around the star system, planning which targets are crucial and which should be avoided.",
