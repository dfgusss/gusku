    "About the game": "WELCOME TO MINDJOB Is turbulent life experience a rite of passage for creative people? Could you be a great artist, musician, writer without traumatic (or dramatic) life episodes? Well, Mindjob, a high tech company proves once again that nothing is impossible. With cutting edge technology, this company recycles genius minds that belong to deceased artists, modeling them into pain-free, skill-savvy, creative wonderlands. And you, yes you, the 114th Forgetter, are going to make this happen by joining the company and entering the mindscape to: - explore the creative minds being recycled - smash everything related to the artists' traumatic memories, - including real life artworks! - vacuum the debris and clean the mind! - comfort the remaining consciousness left in the minds and escort them to eternal peace This job is revolutionary! You can: - experience the pleasure of constructive destruction! - witness the life episodes of genius minds! - occasionally time travel from the sweet 1980s all the way to the cursed 2010s, aka the last innocent phase of pure-human history - be exposed to real 'contemporary art' ( a school in human-art history) and enjoy its aura - and of course, earn a handsome salary! - Oh, and get a bonus, if you're doing a fabulous job! DO YOUR BEST &amp; FORGET THE REST! Features real life contemporary art works from DSLCOLLECTION. This game is made by Alan Kwan and Allison Yang Jing from Sometimes Monastery",
