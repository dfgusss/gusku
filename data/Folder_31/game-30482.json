    "About the game": "Aerial action with lots of jumping! Take control of Sanae and try to get through the five stages! How to play Shot: Default Z key Jump: Default X key Hovering: default spacebar Dash: press and hold the shot key on ground Shot This is a low-risk action that allows you to attack safely from a distance. You need to align your axis with the enemy, so you can combine it with hovering for a concentrated attack. Jump You can jump even when you are in the air. You can jump in the air as many times as you want. When jumping in the air, the attack is judged to be downward. The power is three times that of the shot. You can stomp on enemies as you pass by them, or position yourself above them to increase your firepower. . Hovering Keep your fall speed much lower and stay in the air. It's the lifeblood of aerial combat, whether you're moving carefully through a danger zone or moving precisely to align your axis with the enemy. . Dash Increases movement speed, and while dashing, attack judgments are generated around you. Use it to intercept enemies coming towards you, or just hit them with your body. You can safely dispose of troublesome enemies on top of steps by continuing to hit them! . Other There are no remaining units, if you get hit, you will have to start over from the midpoint Estimated play time: about 1 hour",
