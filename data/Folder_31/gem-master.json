    "About the game": "In Gem Master , the goal is to expand control over the field made of colorful gems by consuming the adjacent areas of chosen color. As your opponent is trying to do the same, strategical thinking is required to outpace more skillful contenders. There is no time pressure, yet sessions flow quite quickly, with a single match typically taking about a minute or even less. As you defeat the easier competitors, more serious opponents are unlocked. Overall, the game offers four different AIs to play against. While you will easily domineer over naive and short-sighted Greedy , the Merciless , on the other hand, stands true to its name. Good luck, enjoy this little game, and thank you!",
