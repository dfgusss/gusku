    "About the game": "Defeat overwhelming odds. The enemy will be numerous and powerful, but not nearly as intelligent as you. Use that against them. Every elemental interaction is considered. Lightning Stuns and spreads through Water. Water puts out Fire. Fire spreads through Oil. Oil is slippery. Each Unit gains Momentum each time they are moved. Use this to your advantage for a completely new tactical experience. Combine elements, knockback and Momentum exploits for extreme synergies. Every Card can be customized during a campaign using Mods. Mod your Rain spell with Electrified to turn it into a storm cloud. Mod your Fireball with some extra Damage and AOE to make it explosive. Unlock Insights between each campaign to customize your run with new Cards, Enemies, Weather Effects, Difficulty Modifiers and more.",
