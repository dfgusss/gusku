    "About the game": "Experience the battle of GunboundM Gunbound M is a turn-based shooter game. You will fight other players using the tank's weapons and the skills of the avatars on board. It is a turn-by-turn strategy, moving your tanks and hitting enemy tanks accurately to attack your opponent with high damage, and hiding your tanks makes it difficult for enemy tanks to attack your tanks. Many new game elements have been added for fun and strategy to the traditional gameplay of Gunbound. Use clouds, totems and various game elements to achieve strategic victories. Strategies of various tanks and avatars Original tanks and new tanks have been added so the total number of tanks exceeds 40. All tanks have their own strategic weapons. Each of the over 120 weapons used by the tanks is unique. Over 100 avatars riding on tanks have skills that activate special effects depending on the battle situation. Guide the battle situation to your will to activate your avatar skill. Faster and more strategic with the new control UI The game system directly shows the player the flight guidelines as the bombs are fired and flew. However, this guideline is for windless conditions. Players need to predict the wind well and adjust the firing direction and distance to hit the enemy accurately. We've been thinking a lot in the past about where new players find it difficult to play our game. And we've created a new way of controlling that allows players to compete with each other for control skills, but also to progress faster and use a wider variety of more unique tactical weapons. Play with players from all over the world GunboundM can be enjoyed anywhere on PC and mobile devices. You can play against anyone in the world or play together as a team.
