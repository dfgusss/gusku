    "About the game": "Main Features Put Some G-Power In Your Weapons GG2 offers 6 main weapons, each has a unique feel, ammunition, an alternate fire mode, a variety of unique power-ups and you can even level them up. Every time you kill enemies, they will drop small G letters. Collect them to power up your weapons to make them more and more deadly over time. But be aware! Each time an enemy hits you, you will lose a certain amount of G-Power. Explore New Worlds The game starts off in a small building, from which you have to escape. The more you explore, the more will the world open up. Get more and more items and power-ups that will give you the necessary abilities to reach new places. Find abandoned subway-stations to travel to far-away new places or go through portals and travel across the hellish parallel-dimension! Power-Up Your Character Another feature is the Power-Up system. Whenever you obtain special Power-Orbs in the game, you can use them in your status screen to upgrade ascpects, weapons or items of your character. You decide if a weapon should have more power, bigger clip size, faster fire rate etc, or if you need more protection, or better health supplies. Spend your Power-Orbs wisely to become more versatile or focus them to become a specialized killing machine. Advanced Blood &amp; Gore FX When I go see a zombie movie and there are no bucketloads of blood in it, I would say “Hey mister, cool flick, but where’s the damn blood?”. To avoid such emails from angry players, GunGirl 2 offers a whole ton of high-quality blood effects to please all zombie fans! Lots of Quests There are several main- and sub-quests in the game. You can get them from surviving npcs or even from unholy items and they have smaller or bigger impacts on the story. They are NOT grind-quests to cheat a longer playtime! That’s a no-go High Replayability Value If the 4-8 hours of playtime (on normal mode) aren’t enough for your zombiekilling-desire, the game offers a total of 3 difficulty settings (from Normal to Iron Maiden), unlockable playmodes and even a secret character! Music by Josh Whelchel This guy is pure gold. He made some of the most memorable soundtracks for indie-games such as Bonesaw or The Spirit Engine 2 and now he has blessed this game with another awesome soundtrack :)",
