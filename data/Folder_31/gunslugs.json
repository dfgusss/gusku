Fight the evil Black Duck army as they try to take over the planet using their technology and a huge collection of foot-soldiers. You'll get to fight on plane yards, jungles, arctica, egypt and finally the gates of Hell. Drive tanks, fly jetpacks and shoot eggs out of a chicken-gun... ..! Gunslugs is a fast paced run and jump game with procedurally generated levels and a rogue-like permadeath element. You get one live, and the only way you can extend that is by running into the Voodoo priest selling continue statues. Unlock the roster of Gunslugs heroes as you go, and use them to advance your way to the gates of Hell to defeat the final boss. Collect coins to buy upgrades, improvements, and mini-games like the Donkey Kong inspired Arcade game, the Gameboy level, the train-ride, sketchbook world and much more.. you might even bump into the man with a bow-tie and a blue box..",
