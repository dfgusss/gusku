Solve problems for the odd creatures of the land while maintaining the village to satisfy your little villagers. There is no combat and no stress, take your time and linger when needed. hi - my name is madison. this was my first game i ever released and it is not very much fun. it took me a while to figure out my style and this definitely was not it. if you found this through Whimsy or Landlord of the Woods , this isn't for you. i'm not sure its for anyone really.",
