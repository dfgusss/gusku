    "About the game": "Looking for adventurers! Did you ever wish for immortality, riches and fame? Do you think you have what it takes to find the fabled Cup of Eternity? Neither do we! But there's a twist ! YOU WILL DIE! (repeatedly) But death is only a step closer to success! 'How could that be?!' - I'm glad you asked! Allow me to explain: This is no ordinary dungeon you are stepping into. The moment you accept this adventure is the moment you have obtained Immortality - as Ohio Jack the world's 2nd best treasure hunter! And let's just say that all your dead bodies, well.. they can fill up all those deadly holes. So maybe you stand a chance now.. Many adventurers started but not many have come back out! Are you the one to find the Cup of Eternity and learn it's secret? Remember, once you go in the dungeon, the only way back out is to get the Cup. You can give up along the way, of course - like anything in life - and join the ones who lost their hopes and dreams.. In fact you can go meet them now! Down in the dungeons, chained to my walls, still crying about it!! -W Features: 30 Story Dungeons Fully-featured Dungeon Editor Global Leaderboards Killer Artwork Relaxing Music Full gamepad support Endless bodies and tons of gruesome ways to die Hardcore mode! DISCLAIMER: The Underworld might contain: Furry Rodents, strange Snake Ladies with questionable tastes in Explorers, Addled Wizards, and Ancient Demons sealed away for all time! Infinitrap: Rehamstered is made by 3 people living far apart on the planet Earth, and is their first ever project together - We honestly appreciate your support! And if you have any feedback &amp; questions you can talk to us directly through our discord ! We hope you enjoy our game! :)",
