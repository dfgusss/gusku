    "About the game": "When wayward and spiteful souls refuse to move on to the next life, they find themselves clinging to the shores of the Isles of Limbo. You are Echo, a guardian of this space between worlds, tasked with the duty of dislodging these souls and sending them on their way. Use your weapons and agility to maintain the order of the void, and defend the source of your power- the Crystal. Features: Arena-based hack-and-slash combat Fight off waves of enemies with the weight of your hammer and the grace of your sword. Spellbinding Visuals A hybrid of 3D and hand-painted art styles, animated to create a breathing, if not quite living, world between worlds. Powerful Music Each stage tells the story through its music- the energy of conflict between chaos and order. About Development This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
