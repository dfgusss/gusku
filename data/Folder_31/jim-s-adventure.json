    "About the game": "Visual Overhaul Update: &gt;Overhauled visuals &gt;Added Timer to Mazes &gt;Add local leader board to Game so you can track your times. Just type in a tag name after the maze is complete and click enter. &gt;Add mouse support to menus &gt;Made changes to levels &gt;Completely Changed Lv. 10 for more unique challenge and to better match story &gt;Added different sized enemies to some levels Quick Look! Jim's Adventure is a retro style 2D maze runner. Using simple WASD controls, you must guide Jim through the maze, also known as the Evil Dr. Evins' house. You must find you way to the end of the maze while avoiding Dr. Evins' Robots. These robots patrol using random direction movements and chase you when you get too close, adding a bigger challenge to the game. Your progress saves whenever you get to a new level so you can come back to it later. The Story The world knows Dr. Evins, but they don't know who he really is. Unlike most Journalists, Jim does not heap loads of praise on this man. Jim has always been wary of Dr. Evins' increasing power in the political and economic sectors. Jim has been publishing critical news pieces on this shifty doctor on his blog, since no other news agencies will touch such content. Given this criticism, Jim found it odd to receive a call from Dr. Evins himself inviting him to his mansion for an in person interview. So after getting his trusty pen and paper, he went to the not so good doctors house. After arriving and being let in though an automatic door, Jim interred. However, the door slammed behind him, then the Doctor, talking over his in house PA system, reveled his evil plan because that is what evil doctors do. He told Jim that in the basement of the mansion, he had created a world conquering robot that he will release shortly, to conquer the world Jim surmised. The doctor continued saying that Jim would not see it because his home security robots would kill him before he could get to it. But nothing has kept Jim from a good story, not even killer robots, or the doctor's bleak interior deign. And who knows, he might just be able to stop this mad man's mission.",
