    "About the game": "You find yourself among a group of survivors of a bus crash in the Norwegian mountains. Rescue is several days away, so to make it out alive, you and the other players have to cooperate in finding shelter, food and water. But one of you is a killer. The game is a social survival game. The goal is to make sure as many players as possible survive until help comes. Each game session is maximum 15 minutes long and with up to 8 players. To succeed you need to search the area for loot and share resources with the other players to be able to create meals for the party, keep the cabin warm, and ensure a sufficient supply of water. Communication is vital to make sure you cooperate efficiently on the different tasks, as well as a means for exposing the killer. You can start a vote for who the killer is at any time, and if more than half of the players agree, the respective player dies. But you won’t know if you have voted off the actual killer before the end of the game session. Sharing information with the other players is critical to stay safe and to expose the killer. Unless you are a killer of course. As a killer you have a range of different options for how to terminate the other players, but you have to be stealthy. Blunt violence is seldom a good idea, at least not before you have thinned the horde. Poison the food, or one of the ingredients, strangle a sleeping player, sabotage the survival efforts, and any other devious thing you can come up with. But your voice is the most powerful weapon, nothing is more suspicious than a quiet killer. And if you play your cards right, you can get the innocent players killing off each other. The game requires a microphone to take part in the social interaction that is critical to the game experience. join our discord:",
