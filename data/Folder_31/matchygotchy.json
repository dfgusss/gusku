    "About the game": "MatchyGotchy is a fun and casual game full of childlike wonder from the Matchy Star world. Stars need your love so they can build ships, reach Xanadu, and become the rocket surgeons they always wanted to be. Look after your stars' food, health, cleaning, games, and important selfie every other day. The better you take care of your stars, the more productive they are and the faster they level. Stars have four different life stages: smol egg, tiny baby, awkward teen, and rocket surgeon adult. Your level of care will determine how quick or slow they get to grow up. Cycle through the activities to boost your stars' productivity. They need your guidance to grow and work so they can build ships and explore the galaxy. It's a digital pet key chain experience updated for your PC! MatchyGotchy Parenting All stars get two important meters: Happy and Hungry. Your stars' productivity is based on these meters and other care activities which deplete over time, meaning you have to look after them. If you do not replenish these, then your Star will become neglected affecting its health and the rate it builds ships. You could be the proud parent of an All-Dimensional Master Shipwright, Dauntless Elegant Diplomat, Interstellar Shipment Manager, Space Physician MD, Mighty Booty Hunter, Quaint Alien Botanist, or Astrological Forecast Specialist. Just like any digital pet, there are important actions to take towards your parenthood skills. Check the 'View The Manual' link in the bar on the right to download the official 'How To Gotchy' PDF guide so you can become the best rocket surgeon parent you can be. Let's get ready for Xanadu ~☆ The more stars you get, the better your chances to explore the galaxy. Collect them all, build your space fleet, and get yourself that fancy intergalactic Xanadu pool party you always wanted! MatchyGotchy is a Matchy Star inspired game experience. Matchy Star is in development and you can wishlist it now! /",
