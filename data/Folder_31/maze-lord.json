    "About the game": "Become the part of the legend telling the story about an underground kingdom of mazes, which bowels hide the insidious dragon concealing the stolen princess. Intricate tangled dungeons tend to change constantly in order to hide an army of monsters and treasures that you can exchange into special artifacts in the local Magic Shop. Also in the depths of the maze is hidden the secret Treasury of the dungeons’ king. The hidden Treasury can be found only by the luckiest and most skillful seekers of adventures. To overcome multiple enemies and other dangers you can use various objects located in the maze dungeons. For example, the shield will save you from snake bites, the magic boots are not “afraid” of pointed spikes in the floor, and the torch will help to get through a giant spider’s web. During this interesting adventure you will encounter with: - Unique puzzles; - Intuitive gameplay; - A great number of interactive objects; - More than a hundred of interesting handmade levels; - The hidden Treasury and the Magic Shop; P.S. For all game players we'll offer a bunch of adorable collection of collectible items - 15 trading cards, 10 backgrounds and 10 amazing emoticons!",
