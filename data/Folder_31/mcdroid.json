Upgrade your little farming robot into a BATTLE STATION, herd a flock of doggy bots, listen to giant lasers talking back at you, plant many many trees to cover the land with boosting bliss and collect outfits for your robot! McDROID is the a fusion Arcade/RTS, the love-child of RTYPE and Dune 2. You take direct control of the modular robot McDROID and protect your shuttle and your crop against various types of mutants and mutations. You can either fight head-on by carrying a weapon or you can deploy weapons and let them do the work, you can even deploy experimentals. The creatures either attack you directly or corrupt the ground, some even mutate your crops against you. It's fast-paced, it's full of surprises, it takes brains and it's a bit crazy, it's sci-fi like you have never played.",
