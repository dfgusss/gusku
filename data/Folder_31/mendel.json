    "About the game": "Mendel is a science creativity sandbox. Pilot a probe on a far away planet, gathering samples from the weird native flowers and breeding them together to make new hybrids. Watch their genes merge and mutate, just like those of our own world, producing strange new creations to grow in your alien gardens. Grow your own Proteus . There are no goals, no objectives, no pressure. Just a peaceful sandbox in which to experiment, create, and relax. Tens of thousands of possible surreal plants Watch your plants change and mutate as their genes combine and rearrange, just like those or our own world Inspired by science! Mendel is the first game to receive the Alfred P Sloan Foundation Public Understanding prize, because they recognized a commitment to showing how beautiful the world of genetics is. 'It was kind of like bubble wrap. You really get into it and can’t stop planting and trying to make them do things.' -Nathalie Lawhead, creator of Tetrageddon and Everything Is Going To Be Ok 'Mendel is a beautiful game of digital exploration, inviting experimentation, reflection and calm.' - Jacob Wood, Indie Hangover",
