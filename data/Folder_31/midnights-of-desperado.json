You will start from the grass-roots staff and earn 'prestige' in the community to realize your own promotion step by step. Some open cultivation means, but the plot task is the core. This game can't be upgraded. It focuses on cultivation, dialogue and exploration. If you have played the bystander, disco, the world beyond and New Vegas, you can take it as a naive imitation. 'Chapter of midnight' is a small pixel RPG, which can't do the open world, excellent scenes and playing methods. It always tells stories in a simple and simple way. Let's take a look at the elements contained in this small RPG, * these elements will gradually open up with the game process: virtual world career In science and technology, there are certain elements of working day and night in the world of simulation.

Upgrade official rank, process products, sell, run businesses, even gamble, steal... Some of the worst activities, and then spend money on the blade - in exchange for good things, and even rebuild their own enterprises. cultivation and collection Four kinds of clothes with different effects, three kinds of long-range weapons, more than ten kinds of food, a few pets, five different homes, more than a dozen kinds of collections, technology and magic props with different uses, and 80 days of chattering about the background of the times... There are many new things worth collecting and exploring. thinking cabinet In a civilized society, the mind is the greatest weapon. Improving scientific skills and breaking through the world of black box technology can also improve humanistic quality and interpret the mind of others. Thought is the biggest weapon of the protagonist, and the game plot itself is full of sparks of various ideas collision in the imaginary 'ideological unification' society. However, thinking is a double-edged sword. In case of embarrassing things, the protagonist will be frustrated, physically and mentally exhausted and haunted by nightmares. If it is too 'smart' or even radical, it will be mistaken for cleverness. semi open plot The plot is the core of this work. There will be three main lines in the later stage, leading to the ending of three different ideological themes of three different forces. There are 11 characters with different standpoints in the chapter of Midnight: scholar, magician, agent, officer and leader. Each of them has his own destiny. There are six chapters in the game. Your different choices in each chapter will leave traces, which will eventually be reflected in 2000 kinds of patchwork ending combinations. The story of the game revolves around the aerial world. There are many angles of the story. The second week program adds more profound content on the basis of the first week. There are 21 achievements in the game. Can't you achieve all the achievements in one week? In the second week, you can turn on the God mode, and the rhythm is greatly accelerated, so that you can quickly experience other plots / win achievements. fantasy before us, reality behind us The plot of the chapter of midnight is a blend of the real world and the fantasy world. The plot and characterization are heavy in my hands - it takes a lot of my mind. But this work has left a lot of free space for players, not only the freedom of the plot, but also the freedom of playing. Players can take the leisure stream, skip all the plot clearance, or they can think deeply and make a perfect ending. Maybe it's perfect or not at all. The process of the game is about nine to twelve hours. The amount of words is a little large, but the scenes and dialogues are not cumbersome, and they are not procrastinating. However, the amount of information needs to be calm and play slowly. Please be calm. The future of midnights This is not a big game, but it can reflect a complex topic. After the game is over, there will still be a lot of stories to go into. This is why the launch is delayed. Few people express themselves and eternity at the same time, but everyone is willing to devote their efforts to polish their stories and tell them to others on the screen.",
