    "About the game": "Synopsis Suhan, who goes to high school, is frustrated because he can't get along with his younger sister Sunmi. One day, he went to his friend Jinyong's house and saw Jinyong get along very well with his sister. To the envious Suhan, Jinyong pulls out a small stone, saying, 'I was never on good terms with my sister either, but this helped us get along.' The stone had the mysterious power to change what had happened in the past. Suhan used stones to change poor Sunmi's memories one by one, and because of the changed past, he was able to get closer to Sunmi. Suhan fell in love with changing the past, and then things happened that never occurred... My little sister? 😒😐🤨😉🥰😨😈 Generally this genre of game is called Visual Novel. (Ex : NEKOPARA, Sakura series...) As you read the story, the plot changes every time you make a selection at the decision points. Through this, you can see various endings. The prologue portion of the game will finish before these decision points. Purpose Your goal is to become a close sibling relationship with Sunmi using a time travel stone. Depending on what you do to Sunmi when you time travel, your current relationship with Sunmi will change. However, not always good things happen every time you time travel. Depending on when you end your time travel, the ending will be very different. The prologue portion of the game will finish before these decision points.",
