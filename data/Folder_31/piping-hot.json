    "About the game": "You may have played a pipe-connecting game before, but never one quite like this! Piping Hot is gallons of fun for the serious casual gamer. Rotate the pipes to connect the starting block with the ending block. Be sure to include the heating pipe in the middle. Sometimes the path is winding, but there are multiple roads to success. Play through multiple floors at the same time, switching between them to solve each puzzle before the water catches up. Once the time runs out, it's a race to get to each ending block. Play and replay levels to improve your scores. Go for the most number of connecting pipes you can find to get gold status on each level, or challenge yourself to finish each puzzle with the least number of connected pipes. Play Unlimited mode for procedurally-generated levels. Each level is new and unique. The fun never stops!",
