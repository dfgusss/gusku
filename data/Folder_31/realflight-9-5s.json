It is specially designed for RealFlight 9 and all your controls will come pre-configured by default. Option 2: Use your own RC Radio with an interface. The Spektrum WS1000 wireless dongle works well for this, and there are other 3rd-party wireless interfaces available. This option will require some user setup. Option 3: Use any 4-axis game controller such as a gamepad or an advanced flight stick. *Note: See the Announcements and Community Discussion for purchase links.",
