Base Building Crafting Conquering (Not yet implemented) Surviving Trading (Not yet implemented) There is over 100 items currently in game, most can be aquired by crafting, gathering or slaying foes to loot all of their equipment, yes, everything. If you see someone with a sword or an item you want, you can take it from them. Currently, the game is based on a small island aptly named Misery Island, only suffering can be found here, but you can call it home. Misery Island is NOT the final product, but a small slice of gameplay, with a much bigger, expansive and living world to come soon, piece by piece.",
