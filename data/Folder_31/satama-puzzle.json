Each level has three random variable scoring conditions that get harder the further you go, so it will be a new experience each time. The challenge of the game is to beat your best high score! Gameplay You will start each level with three random container groups. When you put all of them on the map, you will draw three more. Your objective is to fulfill your three score conditions. When there are not more container groups to draw or the possibility to place them on the map, that level ends. If you score enough points, you go to the next level!
