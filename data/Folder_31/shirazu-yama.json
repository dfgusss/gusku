Keep walking straight in the direction they guided you to reach the next checkpoint. - If you bump into an enemy, drown in water, or it turns midnight, it's game over.

It's a strange world where time shrinks and night keeps falling over the deep forest. Can you find your way out through the thick fog and all you will have to face behind it? All you have to do is walk straight. - One playthrough takes around 1-3 hours. - Hard mode: Shorter daytime and more interruptions make it even more easier to lose your way.
