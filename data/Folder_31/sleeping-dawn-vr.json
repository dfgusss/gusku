    "About the game": "Sleeping Dawn finally comes to VR! Awake in the grotesque world of Sleeping Dawn in first person, face creatures mirror of your deepest fears with your hands, dive yourself into this purely dark atmosphere and fight to dominate your unconscious fears and anxieties. Procedural maze Get ready to face this huge procedurally-made maze by looking for the exit. Each single game will be different from the previous one because, at your awakening, the maze will change all the paths. You will have 4 tools to use with your hands: Torch: the only source of light that allows you to rip fog and the shadows that populate the maze Stick: the improvised weapon that gives the courage to face the most annoying creatures Rocks: the best tool to distract enemies returning into the shadow Chalk: the best friend to avoid getting lost between dead ends and crossroads Distribute them based on your play-style but use them with caution because each is a double edge weapon. Losing your way is as easy as losing your companions. Splitting the group is never an easy choice, but sometimes it may be necessary. Your target is the same: manage to escape from this gloomy maze, but remember… the way out must be first opened. Two levers defended by two keepers must first be found and operated to make the exit passable. Hypnagogia: fear became real Keep in your mind where you are and be careful on each way you chose: even the right one is full of obstacles. Dark creatures and obscure presences will threaten your journey: how facing them or when avoiding them is your decision. Learn from the mistakes you make, keep your fears down, study your enemies and cooperate. But remember... Time is your worst enemy: you have only few minutes to solve the mistery of the maze and find the exit.",
