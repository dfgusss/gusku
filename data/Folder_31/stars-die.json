    "About the game": "A giant cathedral of flesh has appeared in the middle of the ocean on a dying world. A small group of scientists are secretly investigating it when a mysterious woman appears, facing an impossible task. Stars Die is a nonlinear real time scifi mystery game with branching dialogues. FEATURES Completely nonlinear story. Have long debates with people or ignore them the entire game. Five parallel, but interconnected story lines, each with its own completely separate ending. The player isn't at the center of the narrative. Each character has their own agenda and they will try to act accordingly in real time, with or without you. You can explore the environments freely at your own pace, but remember, time is running out. Your choices won't be about moral dilemmas, but ideological ones. It's all about your limited personal perspective on the events and what you believe in. Dark industrial soundtrack by composer Connor ORT Linning. ADDED FOR STEAM VERSION Expanded story and improved dialogues. Added optional 'Chill Mode': Play without any time limitation Added new Secret Ending Added more graphic options like toggling Screen Pixelation effect or FOV Slider Improved Save System Option for increasing text size Tons of bug fixes and polish",
