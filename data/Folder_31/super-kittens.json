    "About the game": "Super Kittens is a game where you are a kitten and you have super cuteness powers. You can explore space and help save the universe and other dimensions. You have a phone that can help you hack and teleport back home. More features coming soon! You have a computer that allows you to look at yourself with a solid color for a background. Soon you'll be able to shop on the computer, but only if you are connected to the internet. You have cuteness bombs that can stop enemies and can heal you. You have a cuteness bar that stops enemies, but is weaker than the cuteness bomb, but it heals up by itself. You have cuteness potions that can make your cuteness bar heal faster. You have a cuteness machine that you can make cuteness bombs, cuteness potions and upgrade your cuteness bar speed, but you need to use your cuteness bar's power to create and upgrade. The machine has it's own cuteness bar that needs to be filled up by the player. There is a character customisation menu that you can customise your kitten. You have a fuel bar that shows your fuel level to go to different places. The control panel allows you to go to any planet and is a map of the universe. Heads up the game is currently in beta. There will be more stuff coming in new updates in the future.",
