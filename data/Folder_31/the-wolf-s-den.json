However, that didn't stop two alchemists, Caesar and Marcus, from performing their wretched experiments with the unknown. Disaster strikes, and Marcus now finds himself in mortal peril trying to escape the ruins of his old laboratory in a seemingly deserted train tunnel, running through the heart of the mountain. Unbeknownst to him, something lurks in the dark of the passageway, something never before seen by mortal eyes. Can you help Marcus escape the clutches of this unseen terror? In order to do that, you must enter The Wolf's Den ! The Wolf's Den is a short first person experience through a dark and mysterious world.

Features include: Short linear single-player experience. Complete it within a day! Suspenseful first-person exploration in an atmospheric world. Full voice acting with subtitle support. Hidden secrets for extra replayability. Steam achievements and cloud saves.",
