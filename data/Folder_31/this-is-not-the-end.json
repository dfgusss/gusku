    "About the game": "Be a slime monster and go on a journey to become a king, god, demon, pie and more! Take the medieval world by storm as your purposeful actions and occasional bumbling shapes the future! Inspired by choose-your-own-adventure books, your every choice will lead to new and exciting things. Experience ~50,000 words of story that ranges from absurd and silly to bittersweet. (It's mostly silly though.) Features: -Revolutionary 'Back' button technology! Don't like the ending you got? Just go back and make different choices. No more trying to remember the dozens of decisions you made just for it to lead to a slightly different finale. -Over 150 endings! Unlock new paths, artwork and options as you find 'em all! -Secrets! Lurking among the text and blank spaces are hidden endings, can you find them? -Hand-drawn artwork of adorable slimes! Did you ever want to see a slime in a pirate outfit, undersized ranger garb or an oversized helmet? Well, you can see those and more if you buy this game!",
