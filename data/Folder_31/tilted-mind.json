    "Release date": "Jun 9, 2017",
    "About the game": "In a world where most of humanity spends their waking life inside VR, one corporation has vast control over the planet. To ensure the freedom of humanity, you must enter the private simulation of an inventor long-thought dead. Roomscale Gameplay Have you ever played an old wooden marble-maze that you tilt to move the marble toward the goal? Imagine that you had a huge one that you walked around on top of, and the maze tilted with your body weight. That's the basic idea that inspired the gameplay of Tilted Mind. There are 6 mazes you must beat in order to win the game. Features The game can be played with optional body tracking if you have 3 Vive Trackers in addition to your 2 controllers. Attach one Vive Tracker to the top of each foot and one to your back on your belt. (Calibrate the body after the intro video has played by pressing down in the menu and choosing 'Recalibrate Body.') If you want to try body tracking and have only 2 Vive Trackers, you can still try it, but it's not optimized for 2 Trackers. Optional 'Comfort Mode' that lets you play without the maze tilting--the ball gets pulled towards an arrow extending from your remote.",
