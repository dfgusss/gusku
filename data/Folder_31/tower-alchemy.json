    "About the game": "The armies of Parsmalum advance on the city. Ymira, the master alchemist, turned herself into a mouse, and now you are left alone to plan the defense! Hordes of enemies advance on the walls, Goblins, Orcs, Lizardfolk, and Djinn are but the least of your problems. Demons immune to fire and undead warriors incapable of taking harm from piercing weapons stalk toward your defenses. Landsharks prowl through your defenseless and those thrice cursed mimics keep popping up! Well no one else is going to do it, so it is up to you to combine the towers you have to create new more powerful and exotic defense and save the people in the city! Slow enemies with steam towers, fry them with lasers, and tear them from the sky with telekinetic towers! The choice is up to you, if you can discover the recipes! -Over 60 different towers to discover -More than 2 dozen ready made maps to play through -A level editor to make your own maps or share them with friends -An abundance of different enemies with their own weaknesses and strengths",
