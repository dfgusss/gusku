    "About the game": "In this fast-paced 3 vs. 3 MOBA-styled battle, hero knights use elemental powers to gain control over a ghost that can be placed on enemy bases to lower these bases' shields and drain them of their energy. To win, the player must destroy both enemy bases before their own are destroyed. MOBAs generally take around a half hour or more. Vanguards introduces a fun, 8-12 minute MOBA experience, great for a quick after-dinner game with family or friends before rushing on with life. The novelty of this MOBA comes from the draining mechanic of the ghost, because it guarantees short gameplay. Once placed on a base, it is always draining the base it was most recently placed on, even when removed. The game focuses on map objectives and team fights more than difficult to learn mechanics or complex item systems. Created by college students as part of the BYU Animation program. Play with friends or play against our Bots! ADDITIONAL DETAILS ------------------ - While on a base, the ghost drains energy out of the base and leaves it vulnerable to additional attack by the opposing team. - If a base is under attack by the enemy, defending players must stand in the base area to remove the ghost. The shield goes back up immediately when the ghost is released and the base can no longer be directly attacked. The defending team, however, must place the ghost on an enemy base before the ghost will stop draining power from their own base.",
