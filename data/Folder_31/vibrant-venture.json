    "About the game": "Vibrant Venture is a singleplayer 2D adventure platformer game where you combine and mix unique character abilities to traverse the world! The game features four playable characters each with two unique abilities. By switching between these characters, you can combine their abilities for extremely versatile, fluid and fun movement! The main focus of the game is traditional platforming combined with responsive and open-ended controls in a challenging environment. This also means there are often multiple ways to clear different sections! Semag Games is actually just a small group of friends 'disguised' as a company! We all enjoy creating different aspects of video games in our spare time and thus we decided to combine our abilities and form a wacky game called Vibrant Venture. Pattrigue is the owner of Semag Games and lead developer of our game Vibrant Venture. His responsibilities are programming, designing, creating sound effects, planning... basically everything that isn't drawing! He studies software engineering at university and has been programming in his spare time since 2015. Jurl is the artist at Semag Games. He does all the really cool pixel graphics for Vibrant Venture! But not only that, he also creates sick HD promotional art! Jurl began working on digital art back in 2013 and is constantly improving in both pixel art, free-form art, 3D modelling and all sorts of other visually pleasing things! The music in Vibrant Venture is composed by Christoph Jakob , a professional German freelance composer. Christoph grew up playing mainly Nintendo games like Super Mario World and Paper Mario. Taking inspiration from classic video game composers such as David Wise and Yoko Shimomura, he is carefully crafting the quirky soundtrack. Besides the previously listed members, we have a group of friends who voluntarily test the game in order to minimize the amount of bugs and issues present within. If not for their commitment to testing and finding bugs, Vibrant Venture would be really, really buggy!",
