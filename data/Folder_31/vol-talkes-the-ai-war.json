With the development of so called CAIs (crystaline artificial intelligences) mankind discoveres the opporturnity to embed the personality of a human in a crystaline device and thus empower it with almost infinite computing power. Unfortunatly these CAIs are not accepted as equal individuals by the human race and so, after years of oppression by their creators, they start to rebel against them and a war begins, that will define the future of mankind in the universe. But the story is not carved in stone. On your journey with Captain Kincaid you are forced to make decisions, which will often push you in a conflict between moral and obedience and most of the time there is no real black and white, but various shades of grey.
