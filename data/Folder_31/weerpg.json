    "About the game": "Hack and slash your way through this loot-rich ARPG with up to four local friends. Outfit your classless character to look and play the way you want. As you venture deeper, monsters get tougher and more numerous but the loot gets more epic! Tactical gear combinations and combat skill will determine how deep you can go. Return to your home base to upgrade or buy new gear, outfit your character, and then venture back into the deep. WeeRPG is an ARPG supporting 1-4 local players, or play remote via Steam Remote Play. Key Features Classless characters - combine gear to look and play how you want. Magic, attacks, and movement are all driven by your equipment. Four-player local coop - team up with your friends or family to take on the dungeons. Play remotely with Steam Remote Play. No permadeath - if you fall in the dungeon you will be resurrected at home with a slight gold penalty. Tons of creature types. Hundreds of equippable items. Built for everyone - Deep gear choices and rewarding combat for skilled players, accessible and cute for younger players. Progress at your own pace. Randomized dungeons - Each dungeon run is unique.",
