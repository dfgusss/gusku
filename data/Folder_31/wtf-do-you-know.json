This creates a unique experience for all parties involved, and players playing the game themselves can enjoy the solo experience tremendously all on their own as well!) WTF Do You Know? Your task is simple. You will be given a series of facts... All you have to do, is decide which fact is true, and which fact is false by using your intuition &amp; big-brain skills! Some of these facts are true. Some of these facts are false. But ALL of these facts will make you INCREDIBLY uncomfortable... You will be scored and evaluated based on your answers and in the end, we will see how you stack up against thousands of others around the world! Do you have what it takes to decipher the truth from the lies? Can your brain, stomach, and balls (Or Ladyballs), handle the mind-trickery that awaits you? One way or another...
