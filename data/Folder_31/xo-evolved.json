    "About the game": "XO Evolved is an 'evolution' of Tic-Tac-Toe! It takes the strategic, basic three-in-a-row game and propels it to an all-new board game of full strategy and options. Taking inspiration from both the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game and the collectable card game genre, XO Evolved elevates Tic-Tac-Toe into a more complex and strategy based board game while also retaining that simple, classic feel. To win in XO Evolved, it won't just be a 'three in a row' to finish the game. Players will fight head-to-head utilizing special card effects to gain an edge on the board. Mirrors and lasers will occupy the board to be manipulated by each player to reach victory. To win, you won't just be using your cards and flipping mirrors to be the first to match three shapes in a row. XO Evolved requires the players to match as many of their shapes in a 'three in a row' to have the highest number of sets when the board is full. Along with cards, lasers, and mirrors, XO Evolved offers customization to players to make the game truly their own. XO Evolved supports any way of play, allowing players to change the time limit of a match, the board, the cards used, and more! FEATURES: - Local 2 player head to head - Remote Multiplayer with chat - Game piece cosmetics - Wide variety of card abilities to fit your play style - Control of match settings - CPU opponent - Collect all the cards!",
