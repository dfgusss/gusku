    "About the game": "Aquamarine is a contemplative, turn-based survival adventure about perception and discovery in an alien ocean. Inspired by the psychedelic sci-fi of the '70s &amp; '80s, Aquamarine combines the mystery of classic adventures and open-ended survival mechanics with elements of exploration, puzzle-solving, and strategy. Unlock the secrets of an alien planet reclaimed by nature through careful study and clever interactions with the living ecosystem. Learn how to adapt to the challenges of each area as you search for your way home. Discover mysterious secrets and solve environmental puzzles to aid in your progress through the alien ocean. Cultivate a variety of strange plants, each with their own unique attributes. Scour the depths for food and tools to help you survive. Collect and craft powerful upgrades for your humble escape pod, and customize your loadout to fit the needs of every plunge into the water. You play as a lone space traveler known only as The Seeker, whose starcraft is intercepted by a malicious signal while orbiting an uncharted planet covered in water. Forced to eject from her malfunctioning starcraft, The Seeker is marooned on a tiny island surrounded by an endless alien ocean, with nothing but her amphibious survival pod. Throughout her underwater journey to reach her crashed starcraft, she'll uncover the lost history of this planet, and learn the true nature of why she ended up here.",
