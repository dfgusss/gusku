    "About the game": "Overview Without any signs, a disaster destroyed most civilizations in the world, monsters come out everywhere, animals become rage. People were forced to gather in the few cities that survived to fend off danger, and it is said that few people were able to cross the wilderness to reach another city. However, no age is lacking of adventurers who are gifted, or faithful. Some of them are forced by life, some are eager for glory, and some are obsessed with treasure. Usually they gather in taverns, waiting for chances to cross the dangerous wilderness. You need to get them together, take the goods the city produces and deliver them to the cities that need them. You can only survive on your own after leaving the city, and good preparation will help you to reach next city more easily. Wealth and glory are waiting for you at the destination. Cities There are various cities and they all have their own special local products. You can buy them at lower prices in the market and sell them at higher prices in the cities which lack of them. Each city has a tavern, where you can find adventurers with different features. Choose the appropriate ones, provide them weapons and armors, and teach them fighting skills, they will become the only force to protect the caravan. Cities have lands to sell, buy them to build different constructions to provide functions to the cities, like increasing the output of a product, enabling cities to accommodate more people and forging more powerful weapons. Wilderness Protect your carriage is the most important thing in the wilderness, carriage destroyed means fail of the travel, and you will lose all the goods and go back to where you set out. Wandering wolves, changed adventurers and resurgent undead are the biggest threats you will face. There are special resources in the wilderness, but dangerous monsters are protecting them, you can collect them with correct tools and forge them to equipments in cities. Don’t forget your carriage. Food is essential during the trip, and lack of food will greatly harm your characters' abilities. You can protect the carriage while collecting the ingredients and cooking them into a nutritious dinner, but be aware that the food will rot the next day. You can also take some hard tacks before setting out, but how will they feel if they eat too much? Skills People always write what they grasp down. These books are scattered all over the world. If you are lucky enough to get one, give it to the right member, that will increase his ability. Characters gain skill points with each upgrade, which can be used to improve the skills they learned. Each character can learn unlimited skills but remember only eight. You need to distribute the skills to each character carefully so that multiple different skills can reinforce each other to achieve the best results.",
