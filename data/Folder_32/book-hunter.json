The player can choose between confronting directly with the enemies or studying their behavior to bypass them. The main objective is to collect the 30 books scattered in the map. All the secondary collectibles belongs to the Public Domain as one of the major purpose of Book Hunter is the transmission of freedom-culture in addition to entertaining.
