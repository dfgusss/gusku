    "About the game": "A homage to the decade year old flash game 'Defend your castle'. Gameplay Pick attackers up and toss them into the air, moments later a satisfying squish as they hit the ground. Defend your castle from hoards of attacks. Upgrade your castle, land, and research with new defences &amp; technology. Defences Upgrade your castle with archers, ballista, oil cauldrons, and cannon, or research alchemy to discover new metals, and even powerful magic. Attackers As well as increase in numbers, more dangerous units will appear the longer you hold out, archers, giants, and mounted knights, to wizards with force-fields and lightening. Day / Night / Weather Dark nights when the moon does not appear in the sky will make it difficult to see, weather may prove even more difficult, fog, thunder storms, and even snow blizzards can affect visibility. Researching new lighting and building lamp posts can help to penetrate the darkness of night.",
