    "About the game": "🍊 Castle Formers is a mashup of two game genres that I love. Castle Defense and Platform. That came out more like a strategic and survivor game. Unlike traditional castle defenses that usually use the mouse to activate commands, in Castle Formers you choose to control a king or queen using the keyboard or game pad on a platform game mechanic to navigate and interact with NPCs and the environment. The game takes place in only one scenario with night and day cycles. You must survive 30 days to complete the game. (3min a day and 3min a night). During the day you must collect resources by interacting with bushes, cutting plants, hunting or finding treasures. To be able to use gold to train soldiers, improve your weapon, prepare food, use spells and defend against enemies that will come at night. This game was meant to be learned during gameplay.The player will have to discover the best way to battle and find secrets that will allow the survival of his kingdom. It is about trial-and-error learning. There are several NPCs that at your command and with the right amount of coins will execute a different function to help you defend the castle. Collect coins, interact with the elements of the game, discover, explore, learn and survive. Protect your gate and statue of life and if it is not obvious, protect yourself. Call your disciples to defend. There are two keyboard configurations and a gamepad configuration, it is not possible to change and choose the buttons, just use one of the three pre-established configurations . 1.Right Keyboard 2.Left Keyboard 3.Gamepad Resolution: Monitors with 16: 9 resolutions are strongly recommended Graphics Settings: Does not have built-in graphic options or a graphics menu High refresh rate monitors are NOT recommended. Slowing down the Hz may solve the problem. The game has no adaptation for other resolutions there is a windowed mode which allows you to resize the size manually or fullscreen mode. If it is not possible to access the menu you can use the commands ALT + Enter or F11 Unfortunately the engine used in this project is outdated and does not support gamepad vibration. Audio adjustments are available in game 🧡The game was made with a lot of love, I appreciate your feedback, I will be seeking to improve your experience. if you find any bug, I count on your help to report and register any problem or suggestion through our community on steam.🧡 🍊HAVE FUN!",
