    "About the game": "Colourise is a puzzle game about connecting the dots. It's easier said than done. Rack your brain to solve complex spatial puzzles in an astronomy-inspired, abstract, neon world. Mix vibrant, neon colours together; shift dynamic parts of the environment, opening up new pathways to solve seemingly impossible puzzles; and move yourself to see the world from a whole new perspective. What seems impossible to begin with might be clearer than you think. 24 regular puzzles, with regularly introduced, interesting new mechanics. Special levels, with fiendishly difficult puzzles that will have you stumped for hours. Steam Achievements and Trading Cards to complete and collect.",
