    "About the game": "Welcome to the BOARD: Thanks for checking out CONSOLATION: BOARD MEETING! Consolation: Board Meeting - Anthology Edtion is a series of anthological stories, delivered through a series of unique Multiplayer Party Games. There are currently 2 main game modes, with many mini-games and single-player options available. This game is constantly being updated, with more content to come at no additional cost! Each mode is packed full of Achievements and Secrets for those completionist achievement hunters out there! (Consolation: Board Meeting was originally created in 10 days for a Game Jam, but is slowly growing through continuous updates. Expect bugs!) *** Slasher Mode: Currently, there is only one Slasher mode map. Welcome to the Garnival! In this mode, one player (the host) must hunt down and kill the rest of the players before they can mount an escape. Guided by Emo Goose, players will unwrap the secrets of the Garnival. This mode is Halloween AND Christmas-themed, so it's perfect for year-round fun with friends and family. Tabletop Mode: There is currently only 1 board, and 5 minigames. However, you may find there is plenty of outcomes and content to enjoy! (Content is being added regularly, including in the Achieve Fear Update!) Can you discover all the secrets? Minigames can now be played offline in Practice mode! Access it anytime from the main menu. A Party Game above all else! Pick a name, or socialize using in-game chat. There is something for everyone to socialize and have a good time, with friends or with strangers. Primarily the MOUSE and WASD are used to traverse and control the game. Players can host a game using the Consolation Matchmaking services (Which are only accessible through an internet connection). Characters from other Sayincraft games and projects will guide you through the challenges you face ahead of you on the board. The game has a spinoff story in the unique (Sayincraft Studios created) CONSOLATION timeline, with a more dark yet comical take. A Dark-Comical Story You are an employee at the evil corporation, Consolation Innovations. You have been invited by the CEO, Christopher Conn to join him for a board meeting. There you learn you must compete in a series of challenges against fellow employees, presented as a board game, in order to climb the corporate ladder. Welcome aboard! Streamer Friendly! The game has many original and unique songs in its soundtracks catalog, one of which even has original lyrics based on the game's story and themes! Though it may seem off-putting to streamers, rest assured Sayincraft Studios owns and manages all songs used within the game. Should an issue arise, contact Sayincraft Studios directly and it will be solved promptly! :) Original Music, Art, and Talent! Consolation: Board Meeting features many original artistic works from many talents such as music by MojoKing, and Musithical. And visual art by Sheridan Animation student Bagged_Milkk. We are looking forward to everyone getting a chance to experience it all. (Click the artist's names to check them out!) Stay tuned for more updates, videos, and games from Sayincraft Studios!
