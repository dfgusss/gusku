    "About the game": "Don’t Get Bit is a turn-based strategy survival game. Guide Cassie (and her companions) through 30 levels as they battle hordes of mutant zombies. Each map is unique, filled with new challenges requiring different strategies and skill, but no luck. Featuring a haunting storyline, each level opens with Cassie sharing more of her story and the apocalyptic world around her. Key Features: Easy to learn, but challenging to master. Control 4 Characters as you fight against 9 Zombie types. No RNG (random number generation). Winning is all about skill and not luck. Hand drawn sketches from graphic artist Katy Grubb. Over 30 monologues from award-winning actress Kami Hinds. An original score from Pete Mitchell of 'No More Kings'. Second Journey: If you survive the 30 levels, you can play them again, only this time with a turn limit for each level - forcing new strategies and revealing a new ending. Third Journey: Finish the Second Journey and you can play the game one last time, where every zombie bite is fatal - survive this time to discover the final ending.",
