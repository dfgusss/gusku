    "About the game": "Horror, at its core, is primal. You don't need a multi-million dollar design budget or advanced realtime bullet physics to make something scary. You just have to have an idea that is raw, and the honesty to execute it. P.T. perfectly illustrates this point. It takes place entirely in one hallway. It didn't have complicated AI. There weren't a dozen characters to design and model. Hell, there weren't even that many scares. And it was absolutely terrifying. It distilled the concepts of the ill-fated Silent Hills into a dense moment of terror. It was its own compact experience, and a glimpse into something much more. Many games have tried to imitate P.T. in content. A million spooky hallways with a trillion collectible notes. Some of these are fantastic. But what about that concept? To distill your dream project into something condensed, raw, and real? That was the question posed to 10 brilliant creators. Make a P.T. for the horror project of your dreams. Both a game on its own, and a window into a much larger world. Make it raw. Make it real. Make it a reflection of your own fears. Make it in just 7 days. And they did.
