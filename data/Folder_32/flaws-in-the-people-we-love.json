    "About the game": "On July 2nd, 2009, every living thing vanished. Gone, without a trace. I'm a hobbyist who makes games for fun. You can finish it in 10 minutes. If you play it, I'll be thankful. Description of gameplay The gameplay is a walking simulator. The game uses first person controls. Walk using w, a, s, d and jump with space. As you explore the world, the narrator will reveal details about who you are, what happened. Features: * Full voice acting * Short - you can finish the entire game in around 10 minutes * Story rich - a mystery with several major plot twists * Simple controls - walking simulator controls with minor, simple platforming sequences I wanted to make a game about the stories we tell ourselves to rationalize the choices we make that often don't make sense to people looking on the outside.",
