    "About the game": "You are the Entity, one who is able to shift between realities at will. Your mission is to defend the Typhon Cluster, lifeblood of all existence, from a swarm of invading hostiles. With danger on all sides, it is only your unique power that can give you a fighting chance. Fractured Soul takes the classic platformers of the 80s and doubles the action! Your unique ability to shift between two parallel dimensions allows you to weave through enemy fire, catch opponents by surprise, and leap over impossibly wide gaps by using platforms in both realities. A winner of the PAX Indie Showcase in 2013, an Honorable Mention in GDC Play’s Best In Show in 2013, and a two time finalist in Game Connection’s Selected Projects, Fractured Soul has won the hearts of critics the world over with no less than 50 reviews scoring the game 80% or better. Pulse-pounding gameplay inspired by classic platformers of the 80s. Playing in two realities at once literally adds a new dimension to the platforming genre. Fire, water, wind, and anti-gravity each bring their own twist to one of the two dimensions. Hardcore bonus challenge levels are unlocked through 5 star performances in the main game. Two can play this game on the same PC - you and your friend can control the character in one dimension each! Over 100 achievements to put your platforming skills to the test. Online leaderboards to see how you stack up against your friends and the world.",
