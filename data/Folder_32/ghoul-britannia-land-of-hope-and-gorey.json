    "About the game": "'may sound like the premise for a tense survival horror, but Ghoul Britannia promises a 'bloodcurdling tale' of a different kind' - Adventure Gamers 'for fans of the genre, lovers of sharp, dark comedy, and curious newbies alike, Ghoul Britannia has a lot to offer - 8.5/10' - Gaming Cypher 'charming, funny, and I find the mysteries compelling' - Gamer Escape In a post-Brexit UK, the government's Ministry of Works has come up with the brilliant idea of raising the dead to do the jobs no-one wants to do. What could possibly go wrong? Zombie apocalypse, that's what. Guide Hope Andrews home across an undead-infested UK back to London. Along the way team up with an unlikely partner - a sentient zombie called Dave Gorey who formerly worked PR for the government's undead-raising program. Can they make it past the ELU horde together? Was the outbreak an accident, or is there something more sinister going on? Ghoul Britannia: Land of Hope and Gorey is a point and click adventure game, reminiscent of 90's adventure games with story-driven gameplay and puzzles to solve. A unique art style combines beautiful hand-painted 2D backgrounds and lively 3D characters. Currently in development by Binary Space, Ghoul Britannia is now available on Early Access, with the full game to be released early 2020.",
