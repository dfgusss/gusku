    "About the game": "It's the year 2020. A mysterious, unknown event has decimated the economy and left many individuals, including you, the main character, unemployed. Unfortunately, you still have bills to pay. The good news is that the GrubDash food delivery platform is recruiting delivery drivers! Game features: Upgrade your house from a tiny starter home to a sprawling McMansion, then fill it with expensive trinkets and doodads. Your neighborhood has been abandoned. Buy up the vacant lots and replace the trash heaps and tire fires with forests, meadows, businesses, or housing for new neighbors. Seven stats to upgrade, including strength to carry larger orders, intelligence to find better paying orders, charisma to receive more cash tips, dexterity to improve walking speed, and education level. For the right price, you can eventually become an Associate, a Bachelor, a Master, and maybe even a Boss’s Family Member. Pick up food from six unique restaurants and deliver to a variety of individuals in different neighborhoods. Max out your customer rating and earnings by picking up food on time, delivering it on time, keeping it warm, and providing outstanding customer service. Complete over 60 life milestones and become the food delivery driver that you’ve always dreamed of becoming. Eight unique vehicles and twenty-four total vehicles. Deliver food using an economic beater, a mid-range hybrid, an expensive sports car, or something in between. Unlock new vehicles with cash (or charge the bill to your credit card), completing life milestones, or finding them randomly throughout the world. Upgrade your vehicles to improve handling, fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and the maximum speed. Complete minigames to boost your delivery earnings and your chance of receiving a cash tip.",
