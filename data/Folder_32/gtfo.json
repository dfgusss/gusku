    "Name": "GTFO",
    "Release date": "Dec 9, 2021",
    "About the game": "Your team of prisoners is dropped into the Rundown when a new Work Order is issued by the Warden, the mysterious entity holding you captive. The Rundown is a series of expeditions, each one taking you deeper into a decayed research facility called the Complex. You descend level by level, scavenging tools and resources that help you survive in a perilous network of tunnels where gruesome creatures lurk in every shadow. Complete all of the expeditions to fulfill the Work Order and clear the Rundown. Be warned, GTFO isn’t your typical run and gun shooter. It’s for players that value a serious challenge. A 4-player cooperative experience GTFO is designed for prisoner teams of four, putting cooperation at the core of the experience. Bots can fill your lineup if you’re short one or two players. They’ll follow you through expeditions, sneak when you sneak, collect resources, and fight alongside you. They're a good fallback, but the level of communication and tactical combat in GTFO means it's best to play with people. Prepare, Explore, Survive A strategy is necessary to clear the Rundown. Before you drop into the Complex, your team needs to decide what gear, boosters, and weapons to bring. You must also balance the team, identifying the function of each prisoner so that you know what to do when things go wrong. And they will. They always do. Don’t wake them up Stealth and coordination are necessary to survive as you maneuver through the Complex. Many of the creatures of GTFO are suspended in a state of hibernation, so light, noise, and vibrations can easily wake up these Sleepers. And if one of them knows you’re there, they all know. That’s when things get messy. New mission, new Rundown When the Warden issues a Work Order, a new Rundown is released and the existing Rundown is deleted forever. New Rundowns will drop periodically over the lifetime of the game, bringing your team grisly new ways to suffer. Will you work together or die together?",
