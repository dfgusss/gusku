    "About the game": "This is a short-time walking simulator with an open world that you can go through with your eyes closed. In the end, here you will need to rely only on your hearing. You woke up in the middle of the white, lighted room. What happened? How did I get here? These are the questions that find the main character of this game. 'If you want to know something, just ask about it,' thought the protagonist. But instead of words from the mouth only air comes out. Suddenly, up to the hero's ears comes a voice from above. It is he who will answer all the questions that are tormenting the hero, and will also show, in a clear example, how a normal hearing test can develop into a real challenge.",
