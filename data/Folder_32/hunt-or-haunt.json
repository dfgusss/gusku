    "About the game": "[This game is still in Early Access] A team of ghost hunters has been dispatched to rid the land of evil spirits, but the haunts won’t leave without a fight! Play as a member of either the Hunters or Haunts in 6-12 player online matches, using teamwork and your unique abilities to defeat your opponents! Hunt or Haunt is designed to be a party game, so grab some friends and share the joys of jolly cooperation, or the thrills of trickery and betrayal! Armed with superior numbers and the power to detect and expose their invisible foes, Hunters work together to chase down and defeat the Haunts. Sense the presence of nearby Haunts. Use magic to expose invisible Haunts, making them vulnerable to attack. Refill mana at shrines and statues. Come to the aid of your captured allies to return them to the field. Channel energy into environmental landmarks to set-off effects that affect the whole map! Lurking in the shadows and often outnumbered, Haunts make use of stealth, trickery and sabotage to evade, confuse and capture Hunters. Create Phantoms to stun Hunters and trick them into wasting their mana. Sneak up on Hunters while invisible and attack them to trap them. Throw trapped enemies into other Hunters to stun them. Destroy shrines and landmarks to prevent Hunters from recovering mana. Turn the tide of battle using a wide array of powerful items While waiting to respawn, you can switch between different spectator angles, including a global view of the entire map Host or join public or private rooms, set for 6, 9 or 12 players. Customize your characters’ names and colors (more cosmetics coming soon!) Quick communication with emojis and map signals. Offline Quickplay Mode: practice with AI. Through strategic use of the map and your abilities, you can bait opponents into ambushes, pull-off narrow getaways, and turn the tide of battle in your favor! Will the Hunters exorcise their spectral nemeses, or will the hunters become the haunted?",
