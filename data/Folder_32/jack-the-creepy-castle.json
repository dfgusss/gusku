    "About the game": "The raging ravens have robbed Jack, the hollowed out pumpkin head of a scarecrow, from the field and banished him to a creepy castle. Will you help Jack escape from the eerie prison to take revenge on the sneaky ravens? In search of the exit, you'll hop through gruesome rooms and corridors where you'll face different challenges. Deadly dangers lurk everywhere! Razor-sharp blades swing down from the ceiling and sharp poles shoot out of the floor or wall. Overcome the Hallway to Hell and escape the Scary Staircase! Even the spooky inhabitants of the castle do not welcome their guest, but prefer to process Jack into pumpkin porridge. Avoid the obstacles skilfully and defend yourself in case of emergency with the burst of fire of the pumpkin candle. Can you escape with Jack in this fun 3D adventure? This cool, creepy Jump’n’Jump game will make you jump higher, jump farther, jump harder! Be strong. Be crazy. Be Jack! FEATURES: Unique Jump'n'Jump gameplay 3D High Definition graphics Creepy enemies 24 challenging levels with countless traps",
