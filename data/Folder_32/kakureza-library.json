    "About the game": "260 fictitious books [/] All the books that the user puts out at the counter are recorded in the search machine, and you can browse the information of 260 non-existent books. You can also enjoy it as a fictitious book gallery, as there is a tendency for works by author and publisher. Change the fate of the user [/] Depending on the player's choice, the users who visit the library, the titles of the books to borrow, and the lines will change. The mystery of 'Cotonolia' [/] There are several users who say the word 'Cotonolia', but you, the player, don't know what it is. Small mysteries pile up in parallel with normal work, and the truth is revealed at the true end. It's a calm and light game as a whole, but it also has sci-fi, occult, and mystery elements little by little.",
