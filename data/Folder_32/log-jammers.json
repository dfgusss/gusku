Who will you take into competition? Rad Carlton - The local beach bum and the son of Sheriff Thad Carlton (Mayor Bateman’s enforcer). The mayor blackmailed Rad into competing with an ordinance that will prohibit surfing. Zombear - A massive undead woodland creature. He was originally killed in a forest fire started by the mayor with illegal fireworks. Now he wants revenge. Zombie Jack - Zombear’s archnemesis. Zombie Jack was in Bateman Hills to chop down some of its legendary border birches when Zombear’s presence pulled him into the competition. Bruiser Bogartus - A strongman obsessed with wood. The mayor promised to fund his business of making wooden exercise equipment—if he can win. Mayo Monsoon - Mayo was once an employee of the Bateman Hills Mayo Company. That is, until he fell from a catwalk into a vat of mayo. The execs worked with the mayor to cover up the accident. Mayo Monsoon is ready to tell the mayor how he really feels. Ollie Oilsack - A local vagrant. Ollie was crushed by logs in an explosion at the Lincoln Timber Company. Ollie knows that the mayor ordered the explosion to rid the town of its hobo population. Spare Rib Bonaparte - An animated skeleton obsessed with partying. Spare Rib was a musician in the 1980s who never stopped rocking out. When his antics destroyed the peace and quiet across the town, the Mayor made sure he found his way out of a hotel window. Hot Foot Francis - The pride and glory of Bateman Hills. Hoot Foot Francis is using her athleticism to win the competition and protect her community. Duel in detailed levels that explore Bateman Hills’ seedy history. A small taste: The Mayonnaise Factory Spill - Battle it out where Mayo Monsoon met his untimely demise. The Bone Pile - Spare Rib Bonaparte made some friends in the afterlife! Now skeletons in colorful sunglasses and novelty beer hats are gathered to watch you jam. A Peaceful Beaver Pond - Play over a tranquil stream with a beaver dam serving as your net. This is a wonderful snapshot of what the entire forest was like before the mayor started the forest fire. Join our Discord for discussion, news, and updates!",
