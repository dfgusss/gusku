    "Release date": "Nov 14, 2019",
    "About the game": "Warp into a busy galaxy with nothing but your wits and a tiny ship. Explore sectors, mine asteroids, take on faction missions, sell resources and upgrade your loadout. Earn the respect of a faction to unlock new weapons and ships. Attack other ships and steal their resources but beware: factions won't tolerate hostility for long without retaliation. Masteroid is an atmospheric, indie 2D space game with procedurally-generated sectors and casual, relaxed gameplay. Key Features: Procedurally Generated Game World : Masteroid randomly generates up to six sectors for two unique factions at the start of every game so every new game is unique. Upgrade Your Ship : Every ship you see in space can be purchased and outfitted, provided you have the faction reputation! Upgrade Your Weapons : Ships have one or more turrets. Buy and equip weapons but make sure your ship has the energy to fire them! Relaxed Gameplay : No permadeath here. Death results in a loss of any cargo and a small cash penalty. You can play the game as passively or aggressively as you like. Faction Reputation : Sell mined resources, kill enemy ships or run missions to earn reputation points for a faction. Higher levels unlock better weapons and ships.",
