    "About the game": "Meowhalla coming on Steam on February 14! What can be better than cat girls? Only cat girls—Vikings! Meet the visual novel that will tell you an awesome story about cat girl intrigues in the outskirts of Valhalla. You as an ordinary human arrive in the suburb of Valhalla named the Threshold, which acts like a purgatory for human warriors. You discover that the Threshold is ruled by the Disir sisters, a mysterious kind of creatures that look like human girls with cat ears and tails. You are involved in the disturbing times when the forces of the undead plan to invade Asgard. Only you and Disir can save Valhalla, or are you going to use this opportunity to create chaos and prioritize your own ambitions? Buying this visual novel, you will get • a story with five cat girls with unique personalities; • 5+1 different endings, which depend on your choices in the game; • 2–4 hours of gameplay; and • a gallery with a dozen of high-quality images, of course available in 18+ version (unlockable through gameplay). The game is currently available in English and Russian languages. This is a product of a two-person studio from Ukraine. Our capacities are limited, but we hope to constantly update the game, improving the look, the scenario, and other aspects of it. We appreciate the feedback and support!",
