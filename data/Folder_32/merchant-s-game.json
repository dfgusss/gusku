Merchant's Game is a single-player game that can be played by keyboard and mouse. In a fantasy world you open a shop in a busy gateway in the mittle of the Galaxy. However things are not good as before so you start from the day 1 and continue your journey until the payment day arrives. No need to be worried if you've already done that. So keep your shop open. Forever.",
