In this game you have to control the flight of magic balls and score them into the goal, simultaneously destroying the monsters that protect them. The balls are of various kinds. Some of them can be launched only once, and some do not succumb to spells, so you have to use the other balls to move them from their place. Features: Many levels Suitable for children Nice graphics Has many Steam achievements Compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux This game is just what you need if you want to play something original. After all, here in front of you is a real arcade magic football! Of course, this is not a team game. Here everything is controlled by a single magician, that is you. But your power is not unlimited.
