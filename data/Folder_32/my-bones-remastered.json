    "About the game": "Description: A short classic indie horror about a man who woke up in his own grave in a cemetery. All gates are locked, the is nothing but darkness and emptiness. The only noise is coming from the church on the hill. Find out what really happened and why the main character woke up in the cemetery. The game has two endings: a good and bad one. The ending of the game will depend on your actions. Features: Full remake of the original 2015 game My Bones. The game is recreated on a more powerful engine, which ensured the processing of textures, scripts, models, animations, some sounds, and better shaders. In the game you will meet familiar places, converted to higher quality and optimized. Almost the whole game was changed.",
