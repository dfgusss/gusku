An horror AVG game in which players can explore the storyline from the main character's perspective and unveil the truth. PS:All of characters are more that 18 years old. TAKASHIRO CHIYA Owns the ability to look into others' memory and see people's death. Able to destroy others' body. Enjoy people's misfortune. TAKASHIRO KAYA/MAYA A grade-three student, gentle but hasty. Used to be the chairman of the student union and highly trusted by junior students and teachers. Looks like CHIYA but maybe not a twin of him. CHIYODA KOYOMI A grade-two student, neighbor and friend of the main character in her childhood. Live with a red puppet. Good at housekeeping and of great strength. SHISHIKURA YUKI Younger sister of the main character, a quiet grade-one student. Likes philosophy and loves hot chocolate. Too weak to go out a lot.
