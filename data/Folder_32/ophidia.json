TWO NEW GAME MODES + CONTROLLER SUPPORT Devour your enemies to your heart’s delight in two new game modes. 12 different enemies with different movements and attacks. 4 different bosses to defeat. ZEN MODE features an endless version of the classic Ophidia where the player can play any level in a sandbox mode with constantly respawning enemies. TIMED MODE features more of a challenge, as you race to eat up more enemies and extend how long you have to stay alive. Consume all life as a serpentine demi-god in Ophidia! A decree has been made: all worlds must be purged so life may begin anew. Play as the legendary Norse Ouroboros, sent down from the heavens to cleanse Yggdrasil - the world tree - of all beings. CONSUME Encircle your enemies to devour them and grow in size! Each foe behaves differently and offers new challenges. Take down bigger and bigger enemies as you grow longer and demonstrate your fearsome power by leaving none alive. EXPLORE Travel through five beautiful worlds, each accompanied by a myriad of unique creatures, a breathtaking score, and challenging gameplay. CONQUER Without a fight, there is no true victory! Bosses of different worlds possess unique powers. Defeat each one to truly cleanse the world and progress to the next.",
