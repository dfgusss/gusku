Limited lives means you need to tread carefully while keeping one eye on the timer, extra lives will spawn on some stages so grab them while you can. Make use of the screen edges to warp from left to right, you'll need to know this to complete some tricky stages and avoid enemies. 9 Steam achievments 25 Challenging stages over 4 Worlds Authentic 16 colour ZX spectrum colour palette Fully rebind-able controls Supports controllers (recommended) 5 suitably retro music tracks Free game For PC &amp; MAC Best played with a controller",
