    "About the game": "Parasite is not like some other games, a first person psychological horror game, developed by one person with a lot of passion for videogames. You find yourself laying down in a dark room, in a horrific scary cold underground parasitic laboratory. Maybe you will find some answers or maybe you will lose yourself down there. It's up to you. Follow the signs and try to protect yourself. Do not be afraid to walk in the dark, there is the only way to find some answers and everything you'll need to escape from this place. SYNOPSIS : Simon Brown (Parasite Expert) working at DELTA laboratories. A famous pharmaceutical company which is known for great innovations in medicine and judicial problems with APO ( animal protection organization ) for illegal experiments on animals. When suddenly Simon wakes up in a room that does not remember what happened, he does not remember who he is and where and why he is there. Simon tries to understand why everyone is gone ( are they really gone...? ) and why he is trapped in the labs. He have to find a way to get himself out of there but first he have to find the proper answers to help him remember who he is and what really happened down there in the labs. GAME DEFINITIONS : Parasitism is a close relationship between species, where one organism, the parasite, lives on or inside another organism, the host, causing it some harm, and is adapted structurally to this way of life. The entomologist has characterized parasites as 'predators that eat prey in units of less than one' FEATURES : Parasite contains first person shooting to survive but if you are afraid to fight remember, always you can just run. Searching is the solution to go deep. Εnemies are waiting, they do not hear, they do not smell, but they can see, so do not enter their field of vision because they will come after you. Do you really want that...?",
