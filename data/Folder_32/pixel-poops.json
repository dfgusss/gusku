    "About the game": "Celebrate the end of 2020--the Year of Poop--with this bizarre throwback to second-generation video games of the early 1980s! Joggers are happily trotting across the local park in an effort to reach their fitness goals. But--armed with the healthiest metabolism the world has ever seen--you're going to put a stop to that. Make your way across the park and poop everywhere. Little poops will only slow the joggers down, but keep pooping to increase poop size. When a jogger hits a large poop, they'll be stopped for good and you'll score a point! If you run out of fuel, simply go back to the starting point alongside the taco restaurant and eat. Then you'll be ready for more! In this love letter to old console games from the early 80s, you'll enjoy unique, one-button, fast-paced action that only gets faster! The action is paired with classic-style visuals and authentic sound effects created with Korg synthesizer software. With two difficulty levels, and Time Attack mode, you'll chase high scores across 4 Steam Leaderboards. Available DLC adds three unique new rulesets and 12 more Leaderboards! There's a set of Achievements too! The joggers will come faster and in greater numbers, but you'll be ready. This time is going to be different. Look out, joggers...you're going to have a crappy day.",
