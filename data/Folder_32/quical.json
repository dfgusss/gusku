What?You say you want to be aNinja?That's okay, there's a run speed perk and a jump perk just for you.Use your powerful legs to move rapidly and jump as high as the roofs! Want to have an assault rifle with an auto-aim perk and a fast movement perk?If you did have that that would completely break the game balance.......Well, I'm not saying you can't.I'm not saying you can't, but in return you'll have to sacrifice all but one HP point. Minus perk system to make loadout customization even more flexible Have you ever thought to yourself, 'I don't need this perk, can't I enhance this one instead?'?You have, haven't you?Yes, you definitely have.I have good news for you!This game has a minus perk system. You can reduce your running speed to 75% and increase your strength to 150, or reduce your strength to 50 and increase your offensive power to 130%! In other words, in exchange for making one part of yourself weaker, you can enhance your perks additionally or have more guns.",
