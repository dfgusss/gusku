    "About the game": "Watching humans in their decaying bodies is excruciating.” (*) Report for duty to defend mankind against the machines! The Quickshot Program will prepare you for battle and the somewhat ill-tempered training AI Dash will make sure you don’t cut corners on the way. This training simulation has you take out waves of projectiles in quick succession. Open fire with pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, laser and minigun or wield a weapon from more civilized days. “Have you ever considered that everything around you might just be a simulation?” (*) Some target projectiles disappear after one hit, some are more heavily armoured, some will even shoot back at you and some are not to be harmed at all. Learn the projectiles’ patterns or master the increasingly harder and faster challenges with nothing but your reflexes and experience the Quickshot slow motion effect as you pulverize the waves of targets coming at you. Apart from a quick trigger finger, you should be light on your feet. Dash will launch barriers at you that you’ll have to dodge and when taking fire, your only chance is to dive for cover or get your shield up. And who knows: Maybe there will even be some cake in the end (**). (*) DASH, AI of the Quickshot program (**) ...there will be no cake, sorry",
