    "About the game": "Oh no! Have you ever wondered where the Bermuda triangle leads once you're sucked in it!? Ofcourse! in The Unknown World! Covid-19 has been spreading all over the planet and it somehow reached the unknown world as well! in this RPG You play as Nawara and her four siblings, Anonymous 1, Anonymous 2, Ryan and Victor. All adopted by the same man. Your mission is to save The Unknown World from getting infected and find the source of the virus before everyone gets sick! But that's not just it! You also have an even more important mission! Get everyone a Halloween costume! You will definitely have some trouble getting them all due to the stupid invading viruses and Jason Dalil's sexiness, but don't let them stop you from bringing back the spirit of Halloween! (Especially Jason's sexiness, that one is even more time wasting than the virus, so don't end up staring at him too often...) WARNING! BEFORE YOU PLAY: This game is not intended for anyone of the age of 12 or below and may contain sensitive subjects to certain people, and not to mention it contains a shitty humor which not everyone will be able to tolerate, so don't play this game if you can't stand strong mature humor, but most importantly: I DON'T want anyone with a case of photosensitive epilepsy or anyone who is susceptible to a seizure to play this. If you are familiar with any of these conditions, please... DO NOT BUY OR PLAY THE GAME, THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS WARNING. Viewer discretion is advised.",
