    "About the game": "Reflector is a top-down shooter style game where the player’s only weapon is their ability to catch and reflect the enemy barrage. You must infiltrate an enemy alien base swarming with insectoid robots using only the state of the art reflector-suit to reflect, bounce, and dodge bullets. Your reflexes will be pushed to the limit as you attempt to maneuver through the halls of an immense space station guarded by swarming masses, deadly environmental hazards, and five monstrous enemy commanders. Will you eradicate your sworn foe or become consumed by the hive? Features Simple Controls: easy to pick up but hard to master. 5 Unique Bosses: each will test your skills and adaptability in a new way. Variety Of Enemies: every stage introduces a new hazard/attack to avoid, or utilize in your favor. The Team Reflector: Bug Hunt is the first game developed and produced by Super Dead a two person team based in the Pacific Northwest. We hope you enjoy our game.",
