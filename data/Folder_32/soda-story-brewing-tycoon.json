    "About the game": "Soda Story - Brewing Tycoon is an adventurous casual management game in which you take on the challenge of running a Soda brewing operation. All while participating in the current season of the hit reality TV show “Prisoneers.” You play a prisoner, selected at the very last minute to take a role in a competition that’s famously stacked full of rivalries. Everyone is trying to become the best of the best. With fame, fortune, and time off of prison sentences up for grabs - you bet it’s going to be a fierce battle! Key Features: Master the art of brewing Soda by experimenting with hundreds of different flavors and combinations. Will your new recipe become a big hit with the fans, or will it end up causing revolting side effects to anyone that dares to take a sip? Automate your operation with Soda Brewers, SodaBots, Flavor Analyzers, and more. There’s a multitude of unusual machinery and inventions to research, build, and use to your advantage. Explore your Warehouse, your rival Warehouses, and the surrounding Compound - What secrets might you discover? What tricks can you play to gain an advantage? Relish in the challenges standing in the way of you taking the champion’s crown. With four different and intriguing rivals, it’s all about keeping ahead of the competition. Or, if you’d prefer, infiltrating their operations for a teensy-tiny amount of sabotage. Watch your back, revenge is a top priority for some of these oddball misfits.",
