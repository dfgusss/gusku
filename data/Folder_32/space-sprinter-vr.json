    "About the game": "Game synopsis In the future of 2270, the Earth was a multi-ethnic planet inhabited by various intellectuals. Migrants from all over the universe have gathered on Earth, which enjoys near-infinite resources and energy with the development of technology. The humanitarian Earth coalition government accommodates them all and helps them settle on Earth. However, contrary to the government's intention, the cities where ordinary citizens lived were increasingly complaining and conflicting with them. In the city, a town in which the same tribe lived separately, and the boundaries of the town were divided into large and small disputes every day. To settle disputes, the Earth Federation Government has created a very extreme law of expulsion from the Earth if any act of violence is committed. Instead, it enforces the “running consciousness” bill to settle disputes between races by running, and unconditionally surrenders to the results of running. This seems to have brought peace, but the violence has turned into running, but the conflict has not disappeared. Every town has a fierce struggle to make the best player, and the running race is almost like a war. The player becomes a runner and participates in a death match in which he must win for the town.
