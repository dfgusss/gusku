Learn the backstory of one of the key characters of Stoneshard — Verren. Explore the dark catacombs of the abandoned abbey. Try out a variety of skill trees, from greatswords and bows to pyromancy and geomancy. Find the best equipment to survive an onslaught of the bloodthirsty Proselyte cult.

Will you be able to defeat him?",
