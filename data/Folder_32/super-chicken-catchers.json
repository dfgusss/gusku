    "About the game": "It's Year 2 of Era 4 on Planet 12, which can only mean one thing... it's time for the galaxy-wide Cluckball Championship! As the entire galaxy watches, you and your fellow Twelvians will battle for the ultimate 2v2 sporting prize. But with the competition so fierce, you and your partner will need to hone your co-operative tactics to become champions of the stars. How will you collaborate? What's your game plan? Will you outwit your opponents and emerge victorious, as the team in possession of the fabled chicken? It's time to go clucking wild… It's not easy being a professional chicken-catcher. You'll need to communicate to trick and flee your enemies. Cooperation is the key to success! The Rider: As a gleeful Twelvian Rider, you'll jump and glide in the air, and are more than a little handy witha weapon. But when you're in possession of the chicken, your powers are limited. Pass the chicken to your Mount to regain your agility! The Mount: This little piggy sure packs a punch. Charge, attack, accelerate, and activate triggers - but when you've got the chicken, you're rendered far less deadly. Pass the chicken to your Rider to blitz your opponents once more! In the future, chicken-catchers can play from anywhere they like! Online : Challenge your friends to a private game, or join the rest of the galaxy to compete for supremacy! Split-screen: Gather up to four friends and ride your buddies during frantic couch co-op parties! Solo: Prepare for competition with training races and other solo challenges! AND MORE! An array of colorful arenas, each with its own set of special features! Cosmetic customization: spend your winnings and become a recognizable celebrity chicken-catcher! An ever-expanding world, with regular free content updates to keep the competition fresh! No chickens were harmed in the making of this game.",
