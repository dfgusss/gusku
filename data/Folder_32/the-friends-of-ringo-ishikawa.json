    "About the game": "A highschool gang leader Ringo Ishikawa trying to live through his last autumn before graduation. With his best friends. You should play it if: 1) You're fond of good stories with strong dialogues (especially about growing up) 2) You're a fight games enthusiast (you'll get your hands on some unique brawl mechanic and I promise you'll be satisfied) 3) You're into some yakuza-delinquent aesthetics Basically, the game is an existential open world beat'em up with some school sim elements. It has a little of everything: a town to explore, day-night cycle, npc on their schedule, battle grinding, school grinding, mini-games (ping-pong, billiard, video-poker, video-game console with one game...) and so on. But the main thing is the story I'm trying to tell. And I designed the game to make you feel this story. So it's not about rival gangs, or taking over turfs, or anything. You just live there and feel. And that's all.",
