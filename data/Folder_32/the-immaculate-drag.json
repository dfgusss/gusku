    "Name": "The Immaculate Drag",
    "Release date": "Jan 17, 2022",
    "About the game": "Late one insomniac night, a washed-up writer grabs his cigarettes (last pack, for real this time) and sets out into the moonlit streets, searching for closure on the memories that haunt him and inspiration to keep moving forward. As he wanders the block, he shares fleeting connections over cigarettes with other lonely souls living on the fringe. The Immaculate Drag is an atmospheric first-person walking/talking/smoking simulator, a brief experience that takes players on a melancholic journey through themes of depression, nostalgia, mortality, and the meaning of creativity. Featuring branching dialogues with a cast of eccentric characters and an evocative original score inspired by retrowave, lof-fi hip hop, and jazz, The Immaculate Drag invites you to light up and let go. Breathe deep, life is short. PLEASE NOTE: The Immmaculate Drag is a small game, and a single playthrough should take 30-45 minutes on average.",
