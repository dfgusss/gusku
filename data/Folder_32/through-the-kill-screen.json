    "About the game": "Kill Screen Noun: A level in a computer game that is impossible to win. 1980s kids had it the best. Powered by syrup-ice Slushies, they ran riot, hiding from bullies and plotting with best friends to fill the hours with fun and games. Ringing doorbells before dashing away, between sugar rushes and thumb-wars, life was never dull. With parents glued to the TV, serenaded by the RATA-TATAT of action hero movies, 1980s kids played computer games until friction built blisters on their fingers. But it wasn't all good. Sometimes 1980s kids were sent to stand in the naughty corridor, awaiting lectures of doom from sadistic Head Teachers. Sometimes bullies cornered their prey with wicked, menacing intentions. And, once, some kids played a computer game so well that they actually broke through the Kill Screen and uncovered a terrible secret. You are one of those kids. Can you endure what slumbers beyond the final level? Through the Kill Screen is an Adventure RPG with horror/thriller elements. You take the role of Leon, a mischievous boy enjoying his 1980s childhood. Imagine a bit of The Goonies, War Games and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, mixed with Mother, Undertale and a dash of Lisa and you'll be somewhat prepared for a colourful and sinister quest through small-town Britain. In a world full of curiosities, fun and danger, with multiple endings, Through the Kill Screen is a journey quite different from anything you have experienced before. Features: Tense and scary. Or whimsical and darkly funny. Explore Snoring Town, where secrets wait behind every corner, in every cereal box, around the u-bend or inside the washing machine. Build your CHEEKINESS, IMAGINATION, FINGER SPEED and GOODY GOODY stats to affect your character's final, adult form. Multiple endings. Meet Pebble the famous boxer, from such films as Pebble I, II and III. Bond with the local moggies. Play Knock Down Ginger. With amazing 8bit-style chip-tunes from a variety of talented composers. Bright, colourful, cartoony pixel art. The trailer contains the following amazing tunes: Mini Game by xDeviruchi 8bit Nightmare by z3r0",
