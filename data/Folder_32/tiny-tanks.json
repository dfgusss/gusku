    "About the game": "Tiny Tanks is an multiplayer game with toy tanks that blow each other up in a completely destructible arena. With hundreds of game modes and modifier combinations, each round is different. BLOW UP EVERYTHING! You can blow up the whole map with your mines. Burry your friends below huge piles of debris or make the plummet into the depths of defeat with your cleverly placed explosives. You can blow up the whole map! WEAPONS FOR EVERYONE To keep things interesting there are regular air-drops with gun crates. Each containing a different weapon. Pick 'em up and get going. Who is going to stop you when you are shooting with homing missiles. PLAY HUNDREDS OF GAME VARIANTS Each round is made up of two substantial parts: A Game Mode and up to three Modifiers. The game mode defines the goals of the round. Instead of shooting each other you might have to hide under a moving dome, to not get hit by explosives. To add more fun to the equation you can spice up every game mode with a huge variety of modifiers. Snow, darkness, low gravity. You name it. CUSTOMIZE YOUR TANK You can build your own tank from 33 unique tank parts. Not only does your tank look different now, but it even drives different!
