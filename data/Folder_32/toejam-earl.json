    "About the game": "ToeJam &amp; Earl™ are both highly funky aliens from the planet Funkotron. Recently they ran into a slight problem... They were cruising in their highly funky, ultra cool, righteous rapmaster rocketship when Earl said he’d like a shot at driving. To cut a long story short, the rocketship is now in pieces spread over the most insane planet in the galaxy – planet Earth! All they have to do now is find the ten pieces of their rocketship and they’re on their way. Doesn’t sound so hard does it?",
