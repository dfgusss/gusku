    "About the game": "The crew of the space station Deliverance has just settled into their cryopods in preparation for the long journey to Tau Ceti. The AI has been activated, and is running a cursory systems check. Engines: fine. Navigation: fine. Unexpected lifeforms: ... one. A lifeform that doesn't care about the mission. A lifeform that doesn't care about the sophisticated defence systems. A lifeform that only cares about getting its grubby hands on the station's trash. A raccoon. Trash Quest is a compact metroidvania with zero checkpoints, run and gun action and tight platforming. Navigate an interwoven maze of rooms through this space station destroying robots, collecting power ups and unlocking shortcuts. A metroidvania with no checkpoints? Progress in Trash Quest saves automatically, and the level is tightly packed around one single spawn location. Each time you die you'll be sent back to that one spot in the middle, but any powerups, abilities, or shortcuts you've unlocked remain. Promotional art by ShyShyOctavia",
