    "About the game": "Once upon a time in the North lived bold people - the Vikings. They built strong boats, the Drakkars, and sailed on them very far from their native coasts, opening up new lands. In breaks between campaigns Vikings arranged races on their drkkarahs on rough rivers, collecting chests with awards and bypassing logs-obstacles. Feel yourself a Viking, play alone, developing attention, or with a friend on one computer. Control: 1st player AD 2nd player arrows or gamepad.",
