    "About the game": "VoxVR is a creative tool which lets you create 3D voxel models in virtual reality. VoxVR is a creative tool that allows you to create 3D models using cubes in virtual reality. Creating voxel art has never been more intuitive and easier! Stand in your own artwork while creating it or edit your existing creations by importing existing voxel files (.vox, .qb) to view them from a whole new perspective. This software offers artists and gamers lots of fun by providing an entertaining and easy to use VR-workspace. For Gamers Build everything you can imagine. From characters and pixel-art to vehicles and buildings. It is a lot easier and so much more fun to build 3D objects in 3D space than on a 2D screen. Share your creations with your friends and get new models from the Steam Workshop. For Artists VoxVR is perfect for voxel artists because of the physical environment which lets you place voxels precisely and fast, in combination with our on productivity optimized tools. You can use different brushes of variable size, which were created on the request of artists using VoxVR, to sculpt your model. Choose between a RGB and HSV color selector or pick your colors using the pipette, then save your colors in the color palette for easy access. We also want to offer you as much compatibility to traditional programs as possible. That is why VoxVR already supports the import and export of Magica Voxel (.vox) and Qubicle (.qb) files, as well as export to common 3D model files like .obj. Currently supported import formats: .vox (Magica Voxel) .qb (Qubicle) .png (Image) .vxvr (VoxVR) Import from Steam Workshop Export formats: .vox (Magica Voxel) .qb (Qubicle) .vxvr (VoxVR) .obj (3D Model) .dae (Collada) .stl (Model for 3D Printing) Upload to Sketchfab Upload to Steam Workshop",
