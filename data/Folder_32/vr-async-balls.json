    "About the game": "VR Async Balls will immerse you into the virtual world of the cosmopark, where you can play on a slot machine. You have to hold two balls at one and the same time on different moving tracks. Firstly, only one level is available for you, after passing it, the next will be opened. There are 20 levels in the game, each of them is more difficult than the previous one. The tracks curiously bend into space and after pressing the Start button, they begin to move at a constant speed. You need to prevent two balls from falling off these tracks with your hands and bring them to the end. Trained people, like pianists, can easily move their hands in different directions independently of each other. This simulator will allow you to check how asynchronous your brain works, how accurately and consciously you can move your hands, how much you can concentrate and control the movements of two balls at once. This little game will bring you a lot of fun and joy from its passage. Good luck!",
