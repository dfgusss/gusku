    "About the game": "We control a boy who lives in the game in normal life. We can go to school or get out of school. At the beginning of the game, we choose the girl we love and we try to be her lover. You can eat at school. Chat on computer with your favorite girl. You can change your clothes in the wardrobe at home. You can take a shower You can play football. You can photograph people. Or you can kill them. But you have to be careful, after killing someone, you get blood and people can call the police when they see it. At the moment there are many functions in the development stage, so give us your thoughts on the early access to the game and inform us about the places that need improvement. We are open to new ideas and many functions may not work stable.",
