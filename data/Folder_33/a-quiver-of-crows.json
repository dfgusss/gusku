    "About the game": "A difficult twin-stick shmup set in a grim world cursed by demons and ghouls. Frantic Battles in a Grim World Unlike most shmups, this world is made up of flesh, bones, and dirt instead of the common rigid objects such as ships set in space. Each enemy type has a unique set of behaviors. Most foes do not follow preset patterns. Instead, they try to hunt you down. Some enemies fly in close for melee combat. Others will shoot from a far away range. Co-op Twin-Stick Action The game blends the insanity of shmups with the free range of motion of twin-stick shooters. Find a friend. Find a couch. Have tons of fun with the optional single-screen couch co-op! Upgradeable Weapons, Bombs, and Shields Collect and enhance a variety of weapons. Influenced by traditional shmups, watch as your weapons’ firing trajectory and pattern change with each upgrade. From heat seeking quills to things that go BOOM, collect them all and use them to crush your foes! Upgrade your shields to withstand relentless attacks. Play on Windows, Mac, &amp; Linux Best played with a twin-stick controller. Steer with the left stick, aim with the right. Never fear! You can also use your keyboard and mouse.",
