    "About the game": "A TURD'S LIFE focuses on the life of a brand new turd with challenging infinite 3D runner type of gameplay and difficult bosses with very dynamic gameplay! Ever wonder what happens to poop after you flush it down? Most believe it simply goes through pipes and into a sewer, later into a receptacle of some sort to be disposed. This is not so - every turd must go through a treacherous trial of strength and courage before it is deemed worthy of freedom. There will be many obstacles and hardships that must be conquered for the poor young turdlet. A TURD'S LIFE features checkpoints with very difficult obstacles in between: jump, duck, dodge or shoot your way through enemies, obstacles and bosses! collect coins and weapon powerups! It is up to you, the player, to help the turdlet and guide it through the difficult path to freedom, where it can finally join its fellow free turds in turd paradise.",
