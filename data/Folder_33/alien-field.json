    "About the game": "The aliens are on the warpath in this Rogue-like Dot Eater! In Alien Field 3671, Up to two players will face endless waves of extra-terrestial evil! You have three minutes to achieve as high a score as possible. By destroying aliens and collecting energy cannisters, you'll enter new stages, where more scoring opportunities and dangers await! Utilize a high-intensity dash-attack to immediately waste a row of aliens for a massive combo bonus. The instant burst of speed can only be stopped by colliding with a wall or item. Master this stunning technique to efficiently clear stages and earn tons of points! Don't forget about your cannon. It's very effective at keeping foes at bay. When friends team up, their combined energy results in a mighty forcefield. Take advantage of this to smash even more aliens. Three versions of Alien Field are included: *Alien Field 3671 This is the ultimate evolution of the Microcomputer classic. Instead of a 'lives' system like in the original, players have to contend with a time limit. There are numerous items to collect that will increase score and add time. Bombs can also be found and detonated, laying waste to scores of enemies. Four composers have participated in this version. -Swedish electronic group Ibojima -Micom Basic Magazine Sound Writer Hideki Awata -Junko Ozawa, composer for many classic Namco games like Gaplus, The Tower of Druaga, and Dig Dug 2. -Last but not least, there's Wing *, who has contributed to previous Mindware releases like Heiankyo Alien 3671 and Space Mouse: 35th Anniversary. *Alien Field Arrange Version The original game has been slightly revamped with new features and a more accessible level of difficulty. The BGM uses the equivalent of a PCG-8100 sound source, for a very authentic experience. *Alien Field Back in May of 1981, Alien Field was published in the first issue of BASIC magazine. This is a port of the PC-8001 original.",
