    "About the game": "Take your enchanted weapons, enter an egyptian temple, fight demon-possessed mummies and unleash the ancient god Anubis. Welcome to Anubis Challenge! An action-based VR Game in a vast, egyptian temple. The evil god Seth desires to rule more than the Netherworld so he imprisoned Anubis to invade the World of Being. YOU are the last hope for Anubis and the World of Being. Go into the Oblivion to fight the demon-possessed mummies and unleash Anubis from his chains. First, get to know your weapons well. Second, learn the way of movement. Now you are prepared to attack or dodge enemies you encounter! Once you enter the combat ground through a portal there is no return. Unless you prove your reaction skills and withstand multiple waves of demon-possessed mummies. They could be behind every corner of the ancient temple. So watch out! Teleportation: Teleport yourself through the ancient temple and move freely within the grid. This way the possibility for motion sickness is at its minimum. Fighting: Fight with your sword and crossbow-gun to defeat the waves of enemies. The handling of the weapons is easy and intuitive to learn, so the enjoyable part begins straight away. Enemies: Defeat different types of demon-possessed mummies with various abilities. They will try everything to keep you from fulfilling your goal. We are a young indie studio from Berlin with the name Noblemen VR. We created Anubis' Challenge driven by the fascination of virtual reality and the excitement of exploring it further. The project started off as a student project in a game development school (Games Academy) in 2016.
