    "About the game": "Arraynium is a puzzle game that requires one simple task: get the left hand side of blocks to match the right hand side. We designed Arraynium to offer a new puzzle challenge to all of the brain &amp; logic game fans. #How to PLAY# The controls are simple, but they require lots of strategy and thinking as you progress through the levels. Simply click on a block on the left hand side and it will jump 2 colors, and all the blocks touching will change 1 color. #Puzzle That Will Make You THINK# You have already mastered many puzzle games? We dare you to try Arraynium. We know that this type of thinking puzzle will not be an easy target, even for the smartest and best puzzle match game players. #Tons of LEVELS# Puzzles would not be interesting if the levels are not variable and unpredictable. We worked hard to make the levels challenging, hard, but also extremely entertaining. #Smooth GAMEPLAY# The gameplay of the game is really smooth. You will learn how to play and get into the game easily. However, mastering it won`t be easy. #LEADERBOARDS and Achievements What’s the point in playing brain challenging games when you can’t brag about your score and climb up on the leaderboard? That’s why Arraynium features leaderboards and achievements to give you that extra motivation. #Captivating and Unique MUSIC# The music is done by the legendary game composer Chris Hülsbeck. Arraynium is one of the new puzzle brain challenge, match games that everyone should try out. One thing we guarantee is that you’ll always want to do better even on the levels you’ve already passed. It’s the challenging and interesting nature of this lovely puzzle game that will urge to do that.",
