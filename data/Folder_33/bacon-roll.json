    "About the game": "MEET THE FAMILY Help Dot the pig roll away from the evil wolf chef, thus ruining his dinner plans. With the help of his father and his brother, you will guide Dot to his beloved Princess Rune. DISCOVER CRAZY WORLDS Throughout the escape Dot will encounter various environments, from forests, snow mountains to sci-fi and even maybe a little trip to other worlds. Who knows. Maybe he's an astronaut pig. Maybe he's a super pig that can fly. You will have to help Dot avoid the evil chefs traps, and roll his way around all kinds of obstacles. Not to mention being super distracted by targets that you have to shoot tomatoes at. But hey, can you resist? I didn't think so. Each new world is unlocked as the game progresses and you complete the objectives. CONQUER YOUR POWER UPS Unlock a variety of power ups to help Dot throughout his escape, as well as discover new outfits for him to wear that give him extra special bonuses when he wears them. Roll, Jump, shoot and dodge. That’s the way the pig goes. You can upgrade your power ups in the game using the tomato currency. The more tomatoes you collect while you play, the more you can upgrade your power ups as well as unlock new outfits for Dot give you extra bonuses on levels while you wear them. SHOW OFF YOUR DANCE MOVES You have trotters instead of your hands! Isn't that a good enough reason to dance? Possible side effects of this game are, and not limited to, feelings that you: - Are a pig - Can smell tomatoes - Have explored the far corners of the earth and beyond - Are required to dance - Can make pigs fly - See fruits much larger than usual - Can see targets everywhere",
