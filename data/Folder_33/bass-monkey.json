    "About the game": "Bass Monkey is a free hack n' slash, arcade action-platformer , set to the music of a 5 song EP ! Up to 4 players can compete (or co-operate!) in this short, low-stress, musical platformer. Play as a bass swingin' monkey or guitar swingin' panda, collect bananas, smack away your fans, and try to top the high score leaderboards! Features: Select your character and adjust strength, agility, and health stats to prepare for battle! Attack with elegant combos and dodge enemy attacks. Race to collect bananas, because they're tasty (and add to your point score)! Progress through an instrumental pop album. Each song brings its own new challenges! Play solo, compete against friends (4 players), or cooperate as a band to achieve the highest score you can! A note from the developer: I hope that this little game offers you a short yet pleasant experience ! It’s good to play with friends/family, because it makes for a fun party game and an easy introduction into video games (it features infinite 'continues'). Or, if you’re playing alone and you have a decent pair of headphones/speakers, it can be a chill musical experience where you can try to max out your score on the leaderboards. Either way, I hope it brings you some joy -- I sure enjoyed making it! Cheers, Jacob Weersing (YakobSoup)",
