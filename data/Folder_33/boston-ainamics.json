    "About the game": "HARDCORE!!! The goal of the game it to reach the finish by getting through different obstacles. To do this, teach your robot particular movements - place the icons onto the appropriate place and watch the robot's progress. The DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC) was a prize competition funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. Held from 2012 to 2015, it aimed to develop semi-autonomous ground robots that could do 'complex tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments. The DRC followed the DARPA Grand Challenge and DARPA Urban Challenge. It began in October 2012 and was to run for about 33 months with three competitions: a Virtual Robotics Challenge (VRC) that took place in June 2013; and two live hardware challenges, the DRC Trials in December 2013 and the DRC Finals in June 2015.",
