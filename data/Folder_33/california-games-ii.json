    "Name": "California Games II",
    "Release date": "Sep 29, 2020",
    "About the game": "The original California Games – first released in 1987 – is considered by many to be one of the best games from the late 8-bit era. Whether it was the original release on the Commodore 64, the slightly-cut-down version that came with the Atari Lynx, or a port from any one of around a dozen other platforms, the unique sun-drenched sports tend to conjure up fond memories from all who played them. It was inevitable that such a highly-regarded game would be afforded a sequel, and Developer Epyx did not disappoint. By the time the game came out in 1990, 16-bit home computers had become commonplace, meaning that the Amiga, Atari ST and SNES were among the launch platforms. Now available officially on Steam for the first time, you too can enjoy the five radical and awesome events: Hang-gliding Jet-skiing Snowboarding Bodyboarding Skateboarding Just like the first game of the series, California Games II is easy to play but hard to master, with plenty of playground arguments about which event was the best. So get ready to soar like a boss, dust some ice and kick some sweet ollies with this radical and bodacious sequel to one of the most popular games of all time! From the original manual Yo! Dudes and dudettes! Welcome back to California – land of Fun and Games! Get ready for the ultimate sequel: California Games II. It’s time for “fun in the sun” as you play five totally new events. First, you’ll try Hang Gliding at San Francisco’s Fort Funston, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, where the most daring hang gliders “hang out”. Next, you’ll take a helicopter ride to the top of Mt. Epyx for a wildly out-of-control Snowboarding run… all the way back down to the beach. Then you’ll take your surfjet out into Monterey Bay for the Santa Cruz Jet Surfing Competition. After that, you’ll compete in the Santa Cruz Bodyboarding Invitational. Finally, you’ll face the challenge of outlaw Skateboarding down the most aggro-cultural California Aqueduct. Objectives California Games II is a game for one to eight players. The object of the game is to score well in every event. Points are awarded for each event based upon your ranking among the other competitors. The player with the most points at the end of a competition earns the title of Supreme Dude. Practice to improve your skills in each event, compete with your family and friends, and soon you’ll be the Supreme Dude. In competition if you break the record for an event, California Games II records your name and the new high score on the Most Excellent Dudes screen.",
