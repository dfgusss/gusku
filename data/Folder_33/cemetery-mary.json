When rumors of a serial killer start floating around town, she isn't too worried--that is, until her parents go missing. And in the wake of their disappearance, a message from an unknown number leaves Mary to wade through a sea of doubts and questions. Unknown Number Your parents are safe. [12:43 AM] Is the rumored 'Blackwood Butcher' playing some sort of sick prank? Or is something even more sinister responsible for their disappearance? Will she be able to find the identity of the mysterious killer, or the whereabouts of her parents? Or will her meddling threaten to make her a permanent resident of the very cemetery she so admires?
