    "About the game": "Climb Challenge is a third person perspective game were the player must navigate through three challenging levels by jumping between various sized stationary and moving platforms. Each level has a unique design and play style challenging the players observation skills, puzzle solving skills, speed and most of all their determination to complete the game. This game is designed to be difficult, however, achievable enough to convince the player to keep trying. Giving the player a real sense of achievement upon completion. It is highly likely you will not complete this game on your first few sittings. Which will require you to master the first two levels and will result in you being better prepared for the final level. Remember, if you find yourself becoming frustrated it may be better for your progress to take a break and try again later.
