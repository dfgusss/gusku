    "About the game": "'Counter Spell' combines elements of classic role playing games with modern stealth-based shooters. The player can choose from six different classes, each with their own unique spells, abilities, and perks. Single player, multiplayer coop, and competitive multiplayer are all supported with different game modes for each. A wide array of spells and items make for fun and intense matches. Throw flasks of wildfire at your opponents, lay cleverly placed traps, or just rain fireballs down upon them. An open, streaming world makes for an exciting sandbox to adventure in! Features: Six Classes (Mage, Priest, Shaman, Warlock, Warrior, Rogue) Eleven Game Modes (Quest, Adventure, Deathmatch, Rescue, Overlord, Survival, Defense, Kingslayer, Tag, Capture, Reaper) 60+ Spells 500+ Items 20+ Unique Zones plus a Random Dungeon Option 15 Enemy Types Talent System Achievements &amp; Stats Level Editor Steam Workshop Counter Spell Classic is the original Counter Spell realm. It contains over twenty zones, over forty quests, and is about a half square kilometer in size. There are several mini-bosses and a final boss to defeat. It offers a fully fleshed out and complete game, and is still occasionally updated. The Classic Realm's graphics are more basic and generally provide better performance for players with older machines. Counter Spell Reforged is the beta Counter Spell realm. The Reforged Realm showcases the newest graphics, models, and tech that Counter Spell has to offer. It is still under heavy development and new content is constantly being added. It does not currently contain any official quests or bosses, but they are coming soon.",
