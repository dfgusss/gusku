    "About the game": "Racing is not on glossy cars, which do not mind hitting the wall and even with acceleration. However, do not rush to part with your car so quickly. If you are careful and fast enough, it will help you become the champion of destructive races. You start simultaneously with several opponents on an obstacle rally track. To receive the highest reward, you need to take the highest position at the finish line. At first, the weakest car is available to you, but as you progress in your racing career, you buy the most powerful cars in order to increase your chances of winning. On the tracks, there are dynamic objects that realistically scatter in a collision, as well as cars have a degree of damage that must be monitored in order to keep the engine working and successfully complete the race.",
