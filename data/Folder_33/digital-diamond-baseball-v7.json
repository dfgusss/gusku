    "About the game": "Digital Diamond Baseball is a computerized baseball simulator that allows gamers to play individual games, series, or entire seasons, using players from any baseball season in history. Never pay for a new season again! With one low price, gamers create their own player libraries, or download them from the large collection of free player libraries. Digital Diamond Baseball's primary goal is to provide an extremely accurate, flexible, and transparent game engine that produces realistic simulations across the full range of seasons. The game is packed with features such as real-life transactions, as-played lineups, sophisticated manager profiles, fictional players, career projections, tournaments, and the ability to customize ball park images, player photos, play-by-play calls, and sound.",
