    "About the game": "Join Wendy Martin, national award-winning science teacher, to guide you through a virtual reality cat dissection in Dissection Simulator: Feline Edition. Learn the fundamentals of the feline anatomy through its various systems in our fully immersive VR experience. Maximize Student Learning Via Teacher-Facilitated Procedure VictoryVR’s virtual reality cat dissection software is a hands-on dissection opportunity experienced through the power of VR. This true-to-life practice thoroughly covers each step of the science procedure that students would take if dissecting a real cat specimen in their classroom. Guiding you through each anatomical system, a digitized version of a licensed science teacher appears as a hologram, providing guidance to users throughout the entire experience. Learning can take place anytime and anywhere. Authentic Science Experience Aligned to National Learning Standards The entire program adheres to the Next Gen Science Standards (NGSS), America’s framework for science learning. In addition, we’ve implemented the processes and procedures of Carolina Biological--America’s leading supplier of science education materials. Using original and lifelike physical models, the dissection experience is recreated to the finest detail and is a comparable substitute for actual live specimen classroom dissections, without the safety and ethical implications. Minimize School Costs &amp; Provide Reliable Curriculum Schools save on expensive and rising annual costs of animal specimens. Additionally, acquisitions are reliable and not dependent on animal procurement. Learning pacing is user-controlled to ensure maximum understanding of the teaching while moving through the program. Wendy Martin covers each of the cat’s systems while posing questions along the way to check for understanding.",
