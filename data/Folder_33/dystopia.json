    "About the game": "Dystopia is a cyberpunk game on the Source engine that places the player into tense combat situations in a high-tech world spanned by computer networks. Playing as either Punk mercenaries, or Corporate security forces, the player will fight through the physical world to gain access, via jack-in terminals, to cyberspace. Cyberspace is a three-dimensional representation of the world's network. Inside cyberspace, players will launch programs to hack into systems linked to the physical world while fighting off enemy hackers and defending critical systems. Gameplay progresses through inter-linked physical and cyberspace objectives, some are completed in either the physical world or cyberspace, others only by a well-timed combination of the two. The player will be immersed in action-packed battles, whether the player is a heavily augmented combat mercenary armed to the teeth with the latest in firepower, or a twitch reflex cyberdecker racing to infiltrate a cyberspace node; they'll be immersed in an action-packed battle. Only through skillful use of the high-tech arsenal we're making available and intelligent team play will players truly jack-in and kick ass. Puny Human is a collection of dedicated and talented gamers who are creating this action-packed multiplayer game. Dystopia draws on the themes and concepts of the cyberpunk genre and implements ideas born out of years of gaming experience. With a competitive focused gameplay system, we hope to produce the next step in online multiplayer gaming.
