    "About the game": "There has been a substantial increase in crime rates in the not-too-distant future, and states have implemented new and experimental methods of execution against this increase. Authorities have initiated a pardon program known as ELEVATED to reduce crime rates and reintegrate death row prisoners into society. The ELEVATED Project was classified as a stand-alone treatment aimed at the convicts to become law-abiding citizens of the society. The players must complete the tasks assigned to them after being divided into two teams of eight death row inmates and an executioner. While the prisoners are trying to reach the safe room by completing all the tasks without being caught, the executioner must prevent the prisoners by using the strategies he had developed. Using the items left at specific spots within the facility, the inmates can distract the executioner and protect themselves when they are stuck in a difficult situation. While the tasks are waiting to be completed behind closed doors, the executioner is alert in the corridors, corners, and shadows. PLAY AS CONVICT PLAY AS EXECUTIONER Key Features The main game mode that you can play in early access, for now, is complete, and the key features of the mode are as follows; “Apocalypse” Game Mode The convicts try to reach the safe room by completing three main tasks without dying. Must find the paper that shows the door number, Must activate 1 to 6 electrical switches, the number of which varies according to the difficulty of the game, to enable the password panels, Must find every piece of the four-digit password to unlock the safe room, Can protect themselves from the executioner with the tools they will find at different points on the map. Can blind the executioner with the flare gun for some time, Can stun the executioner with the taser, preventing him from moving for a while, Can restrict the executioner’s field of vision by using the fire extinguisher, Can use injection for pain relief to recover in case of an injury, Should watch their backs or walk around as small groups since having an FPS view, Can try to escape from the executioner by hiding in metal lockers; but, they should never forget that the lockers are not bullet-proof. After a convict enters the safe room, the others must reach the room too before the countdown ends. Otherwise, the explosives on their necks will explode and kill them. The executioner tries to defuse the convicts using a submachine gun and a machete. Can see the facility better, and by that, he can ambush the convicts as the executioner has a TPS view.
