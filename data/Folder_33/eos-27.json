    "About the game": "EOS 27 is a 2D, strategic action-platformer in which you overtake your enemies through both careful planning and tight fighting. Carefully design an arena tailored to your enemy, then put it to the test in an epic, fast-paced fight for the sake of humankind. Crashed on an unknown planet, you only know one thing: Take down its forcefield. But robot guardians stand between you and the generators. Observe: Study your robot enemies and find their weaknesses. Plan out your strategy to defeat them with the tools you have at your disposal. Prepare: Design the arena you'll fight your opponent in. Craft your arena with platforms and eight unlockable, customizable addons that can boost your firepower, mobility and control over the fight. Equip your character with the upgrades and ammunition best fit for the fight. Fight: Strategizing is only half the fight. Dodge and weave between waves of projectiles, fire back, and slash those robots down in fast-paced fights. The flow and direction of each fight is unique for every player. It's up to you to decide how to conquer this planet.",
