    "About the game": "In 2082, the human species lives in peace, and its technological and societal evolutions are exponential. This game series consisting of a season you must be through the eyes of Antoine Harris to a whole future universe of rich science fiction and composed of several stories from the past and the future. In this episode the past of Mr. Harris and the man with the headset begins to be revealed, but the objective and the technologies developed of the laboratory are still relatively unclear. Gameplay: The gameplay of EXOTIUM games is reduced to the strict minimum like a walking simulator, so don't expect to play an action game, you will play to discover the history of the characters, through their dialogue and some kinematics, and you will be able to understand the path that humanity took to get to where it is. Duration: each episode lasts about 40 minutes like a television series.",
