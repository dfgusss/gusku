    "About the game": "In this game, you must take down an empire of evil, corrupt space ships, and restore peace to the universe. To do this, you must take out as many ships as you can, as well as defeat the emperor, who is hiding out in an other dimension, in an arena, top down shooter-style game made entirely by 1 person. This game is a retro-style top down shooter space arena fighter game that will provide you with [hopefully] hours of hilarious content. There are three main game modes to this game. The first, which is available by default, is a 'story mode' this mode allows you to play the game with an objective in mind. By completing this game mode, you will unlock two additional secret game modes. Both of which add a unique twist to the game The game also includes a full modding API. The modding instruction document is about 30 pages long, and is filled with Python-based modding. The API is so open, and free, you could technically build an entirely different game on top of the original game! The modding allows access to a few Python modules, including Pygame, random, time, and TkInter! A complete list can be found in the modding API documentation. If you are new to the game, there is a skip-able tutorial where you can learn the basic game mechanics. I would highly recommend that you go through this before playing! What's more is that there is over 30 seconds of credits you can watch over, and over again! Good luck, and may the stars align in your favor!",
