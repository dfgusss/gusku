    "About the game": "— An encounter in Tokuo — that nothing about love 　　Visual Novel 　　It is the year 1988. Japan is in the midst of the bubble economy. 　　New buildings are sprouting up everywhere, and the people are ecstatic. 　　The old disappears and the new is born, 　　but there are some people, some places, some things, that nobody notices... 　　or perhaps nobody chooses to notice them. 　　This is a story of people who live for one year... 　　in such a little corner of the city. 　　Kanna is a first-year high school student 　　who's involved in a traffic accident during the summer. 　　She finds herself unable to stay in her hometown any longer. 　　Jing fails his university entrance exams in China. 　　He spends a year or so working at a job he doesn't like. 　　Both of them hear of the incredible opportunities presenting themselves 　　in the bubble economy of Tokyo. 　　Therefore, Kanna drops out of high school and goes to Tokyo. 　　Jing quits his job and goes to Japan. 　　The job both of them set their eyes on, 　　would have them simply living in an old, run-down train station. 　　Although the job only pays a measly 400 yen per hour, it runs for 24 hours a day, 　　so it really isn't that bad. 　　They wouldn't have to pay rent, heating, or electricity. 　　Kanna is a bit awkward around people, and Jing doesn't speak Japanese. 　　The employer only wants one person. 　　Neither wants to give up on this job, so Sakura, the woman in charge of hiring them, 　　recommends that they simply do it together. Age 19 → 20 'I have a goal.' He failed his university entrance exams in China and went to Japan. What surprises him the most during his time there is the cost of living. A day of part-time work in Japan earns more than a month of salaried work in China. Age 15 → 16 'I was unlucky... That's what I decided to think.' She dropped out of high school and moved to Tokyo because of the bubble economy. She's a little introverted. She enjoys eating sunflower seeds. Height 159cm, Measurements 81/62/87 Age 7 → 8 'Sis, buy me ice cream! Ice cream!' She follows her sister to the big city. She's bubbly and upbeat, but never afraid. She's still a child, so she doesn't really understand what's going on. Height 128cm Age 21 → 22 'Many people still have a lot to deal with. Like you and me.' She grew up in Tokyo. Her family is involved in the real estate business. She employs both main characters. She's nice and approachable, but she can put her foot down when needs be. Height 165cm, Measurements 89/60/90 Age 37 → 38 'I don't do stuff that doesn't earn money.' He came to Japan twenty years earlier from China. For various reasons, he keeps trying to push dangerous jobs on Jing. Most of his business is in nightclubs and land speculation. Age ??? A black cat. He lives in the old station building. He seems friendly, but runs away if you try to catch him. 　　 Original Story · Scenario: Tomo Kataoka 　　 Concept Art: Werkbau 　　 Character Art: Werkbau, Ringo, Takehiko Akino, Yatumi Suzuame 　　 Scene Art: Ringo, forfreedo, Kyarumii 　　 Cast: M.N.H, Hiroko Taguchi, Kaori Nazuka, Yuko Goto, Jin Li, Tomoe Tamiyasu 　　 Music: bermei.inazawa 　　 OP Vocal: Annabel 　　 BGM Vocal · Chorus: lasah, Raheem 'Mega Ran' Jarbo, Mari Yura, Annabel, Shouichi Taguchi, Mashiro Shirakami 　　 LOGO Design: Nachi Kio (KOME WORKS) 　　 UI Design: Mu Xia 　　 Visual Design: C.I.C, Mu Xia　 　　 Movie: C.I.C, Yazi 　　 Performance · Script: 2B, Koraku 　　 Program: Xiao Ai 363 　　 Operation · PR: Xue Han 　　 Web Design: Yume Amamiya, Shi Jiu 　　 Planner · Director · Producer: Koraku 　　 Developer: Nekoday 　　English Localization 　　 Translation: Holm Hinners 　　 Editing: tyabann 　　 Script Insertion: Alice Davidson 　　 Image Editing: Liew Shan Yuan 　　 Quality Assurance: R.
