She devises a plan to find her brother and escape from the outlandish townspeople of the Hollow - but is she prepared for the grave consequences? Grimm’s Hollow is a video game inspired by a longing for a short and sweet RPG experience. It has: A lot of comfort food. A lot of cute ghosts. A lot of mean ghosts. 3 haunted caves to explore! Multiple endings.",
