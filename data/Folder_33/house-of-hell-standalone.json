Tonight is going to be a night to remember… Originally written by Steve Jackson in 1984, House of Hell takes players on a horror-filled adventure in the Earl of Drumer's malevolent mansion, full of all manner of ghosts, ghouls and zombies. Don't score too many FEAR points on your adventure, or you might just get scared to death! House of Hell - lovingly updated for PC and Mac. Presented in full colour with realistic physics-based dice rolling for battles, an auto-updated adventure sheet and stat keeping. This Standalone edition of the House of Hell gamebook comes specially themed to suit the adventure. House of Hell is also available to purchase within the Fighting Fantasy Classics library .
