    "About the game": "HOW FISH IS MADE is a short narrative-driven experience about talking to fish and making choices. You are a sardine in a machine, but is life that simple? This place imposes on you and your fellow fish a prophetic choice. Will you help them, or lead them astray? Will they do the same to you? Live through the ultimate power fantasy of being a sardine . Make oily friends, become upset, and choose your destiny. The sardines look just like the real thing, so you can really believe they have emotions. Guaranteed!
