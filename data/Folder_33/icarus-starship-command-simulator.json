They will struggle to defeat you. Randomized galaxy - Each play-through will feature different enemy ships, events and tough decisions. You will have to be adaptable and think on your feet to survive. Many Different Ships - There are over 50 different ships and spacestations from 9 different species. Each can be boarded and explored.
