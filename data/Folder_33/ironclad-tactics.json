Key Features: Includes the 'Rise of Dmitry' and 'Blood and Ironclads' add-on campaigns! No microtransactions! Unlock cards by playing the game, not by purchasing them separately. Experience unique gameplay, with rapid, simultaneous turns that blend the precision of tactics and card games with the spontaneity of fast-paced strategy games. Follow the campaign story through a fully-illustrated, character-driven interactive graphic novel. Collect cards as you play through the campaign and build your own decks to crush your foes. Play with your friends in the co-op story campaign or against them in skirmish and nemesis modes. Face off against online challengers in quick-skirmish mode, and unlock special cards when you win. Bonus! Includes a high-quality digital artbook, a printable papercraft model of an ironclad, and the Ironclad Tactics OST, with music by Evan Le Ny and Farewell to the Woods.",
