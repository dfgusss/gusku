Each of your party member can use any weapon type and any magic type. With the TECH SPARKING system, each of your party members can learn new skills as they keep using the same weapon type or magic type. Instead of leveling up, Island SAGA uses the GROWTH system to increase your stats after battle. Beat down your foes with COMBINATION ATTACKS that automatically trigger when the conditions are right! Set the FORMATION for your party, grab the QUESTS from the guild, and prepare for a grand adventure on Valentine Island with your beautiful party members! ★ FEATURES ★ Plot! Eight big PLOTS !
