    "About the game": "La Jetée is a Visual Novel about ‘a man marked by an image from his childhood‘. An 30minute black noire game, with an deep story, 30 beautiful images and nothing else. Enjoy the autoplay feature! Based on short film made and directed by Chris Marker. Even though it may not be that well known, as an old 1962 Sci-Fi French film, but some people will definitely know it for inspiring Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys. 'A memory has haunted the hero of the tale since his childhood — the image of a woman and that of the killing of a man, at the jetty of the airport Orly in Paris. There is the timeless theme of star-crossed lovers, against the backdrop of an underground camp in a world completely devastated by a nuclear war. There are the rulers of the camps, who ruthlessly apply their scientific methods, supposedly to perpetuate life on the planet, while forcing humankind to give up on all that is beautiful. They use the memory of the hero of the story to catapult him back and forth in time, to find a source of energy, to save the human species. In his journey into the past, he meets a woman and a tragic love grows between them. After a series of events, the man eventually finds himself in the time and the place of the image that has always haunted him; he sees the face of a woman that represents to him love and life in a world without wars. Before meeting with her, he is killed by a camp guard who has followed him from the underground camp, from which he escaped.'",
