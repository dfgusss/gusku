History: With the discovery of condensed steam as a source of energy, the world of Lethis sees an unprecedented Industrial Revolution. As a result, the Empire enters a period of urbanisation. New cities are built everywhere. This rural exodus leads to new towns in strategical places to ensure the growth of the Empire. A time of great change is also a right time for new discoveries and innovation in science. Cities are built around great monuments like gigantic zeppelin hangars and observatories. Features: A campaign mode containing 26 missions with 3 difficulty levels A sandbox mode for unlimited fun Over 24 different resources to manage More than 40 different buildings and 4 unique Monuments Over fifteen different characters that roam the city Maps that reach up to 300 per 300 box tiles An amazing soundtrack with over 20 different songs",
