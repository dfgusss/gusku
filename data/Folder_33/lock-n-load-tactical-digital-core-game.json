    "About the game": "Lock ’n Load Tactical series is a dynamic squad-level tactical combat computer game based on the award-winning board games of the same name. LnLT series centered on infantry combat from the 1930s to the present. With unparalleled artwork and an impulse-based game mechanic that keeps the player constantly involved, each action-packed firefight plays out cinematically. Do you ever wish you could try a new game system and make sure it is for you? Well now you can, with our Lock ‘n Load Tactical Digital game. Lock 'n Load Tactical Digital gives you a chance to play two scenarios from our World War 2 Heroes of Normandy game and two scenarios from our Heroes of the Nam game. Our game manual and module booklets can be viewed online, downloaded and our tutorial videos viewed on our Online Library site at . Our game manual comes in a variety of formats for free, these include PDF, EPUB, MP3 (YES Audio), and MP4 Audiobook formats. Our manuals have lots of examples to illustrate the game mechanics. Our motto is “Play the Game, Not the Rules”. We understand that the best way to learn a game system is to be shown. We achieve this with our extensive play-list of “boot camp” training videos, available on YouTube, that walk you through the entire system rule by rule. The gameplay is fast and furious and decisions need to be made quickly. Tactical leadership is key. Unique Skills enhance effectiveness. And out of the intense fury of a firefight, a Hero may be spawned a Hero who can turn the tide of battle and save the day for your side. Infantry combat is central to LnLT, but besides Squads and Half-squads, we have Weapon Teams armed with mortars, heavy machine guns, and anti-tank guns, there are also tanks, armored and non-armored vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and, in the modern-era games, helicopters. Individuals such as Leaders, Medics, Snipers, and, of course, Heroes, complete the forces available for each side. Whether you are a fan of World War II, Korea, Vietnam, World War 3 NATO vs Warsaw Pact an alternative history of the Cold War turned hot, in 1985, and Sci-Fi with Space Infantry Tactics. We have many DLC available and our DLC Battle Generator with Scenario Edition puts the power into the player's hand to make any type of scenario or campaign possible. The Lock 'n Load Tactical series has you covered with a variety of time periods, locations, and forces. It’s squad-level tactical combat at its best!",
