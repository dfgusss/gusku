    "About the game": "LOGistICAL: USA - Florida is a large open-world, strategy, puzzle game where you transport different cargoes to complete all the towns throughout the country. * Deliver Cape Canaveral's long list of needs. * Sort out the fishing quarantine issues along the Florida Keys * Build you own industries to sort out the fruit and vegetable quarantine areas * Supply and finish many large cities * Work your way through the long complex maze of road enhancements to finally allow all your large trucks access across the state * Many, many other small and large puzzles and situations to complete. LOGistICAL: USA - Florida brings you all the fun and puzzling of LOGistICAL with even more towns, more puzzles and much more to do. THIS GAME DOES NOT REQUIRE THE ORIGINAL LOGISTICAL GAME TO PLAY. Over 700 towns to Complete. LOGistICAL: USA - Florida game covers the US state of Florida including cities like Tallahassee, Orlando, Miami, Tamp, Jacksonville and the Keys. There are many new obstacles and deliveries to make. LOGistICAL: USA - Florida is an independent, standalone game independent from the main LOGistICAL game (and other add-ons). It has its own money, trucks and of course, challenges. LOGistICAL is a large open-world, strategy, puzzle game where you transport different cargoes to complete all the towns throughout the country. The whole game is a huge puzzle while each town is its own little piece of puzzling. There are over 1,000 towns to complete. Plenty of towns are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing regions and contracts. Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own. The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use. Pimp up your trucks with bonuses. Last truck delivering gets the bonus. The towns and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. You could even say that playing is educational. There is plenty more to keep you on your toes. Towns consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion. Big trucks are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere. There are lots of broken roads that need deliveries. Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput. Cargo stores can sure come in handy. What! I can't take my big trucks across the water on a ferry. ... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints? Complete towns, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements.",
