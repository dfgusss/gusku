    "About the game": "Mage Math is a fantasy adventure game where kids fight monsters, use magic and practice math at the same time. The game has two parts to it. The first part is where you spend most of your time exploring levels, finding powerful Number Stones, fighting monsters, fulfilling quests, finding gold, leveling up and other fun things. The second part is how you get your magic by practicing math and using math videos inside the game to help you. This game is for kids from 1st grade up to 6th grade and great review for 7th graders. Large Levels Allow For Fun Exploration As you search for powerful magic number stones you will explore numerous areas that range from frozen lands to underwater and even lava filled lands. There is plenty to explore as your kids level up and find cool potions. We are continually adding updates to the game, adding new quests, new spells and much more. Get Help Along The Way! You will get magical dragons, mini monsters and even wizards to help you in your journey to save the Math Realms. These are just some of the many helpers you can get along the way. You might even be able to recruit monsters to aid you. Battle Epic Monsters! As you play you will battle numerous monsters in an attempt to find what is causing chaos in the math realms. Your magic will grow stronger and new spells will be unlocked as you save the realms and find the Number Stones that could save us all. Kids Feel Confident In Math The goal of Mage Math is to help kids feel confident in math by removing the fear and anxiety that often accompanies math. As you play the game you will regenerate magic by answering math questions from grades 1st through 6th. Players are free to choose which grades they want to play in and are encouraged to master all topics in grades below theirs. This helps them build a firm foundation in math. Our math videos that are used inside schools are now inside the game to help players feel confident answering new questions they may not be familiar with. Kids will watch how the math works and then answer similar questions covered in the video. The videos help take away a lot of pain and fear associated with math problems. Your kids will LOVE this game! We are excited to see you start your journey to save the Math Realms.",
