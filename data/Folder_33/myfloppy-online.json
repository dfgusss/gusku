    "About the game": "MyFloppy is a virtual pet revolution that invites gamers to step into the wacky online world of Floppy- the world’s most beloved floppy disk! Design your Floppy avatar, customize your room, battle, rob and visit other Floppys online! CUSTOM ITEM CREATION: Draw your own items! Using the in-game item creation tool, you can make anything- from a mundane dining chair to a christmas tree covered in spaghetti strands! These items will be listed on the community store, putting money directly in your pocket! You’ll also receive a free copy of your item. The only limit is your own imagination and business acumen! HOME SWEET HOME: Rags to riches! As you level up your Floppy, his humble abode will grow ever fancier. Guide Floppy as he goes from a panhandler squatting in a cardboard box to a multimillionaire with a beachfront villa! Fill up Floppy’s house with all kinds of crazy items available in the shop. Your dream home is Floppy’s dream home! FRIENDLY FLOPETITION: Feeling social? Add a chill Floppy to your friends list and check out their bachelor pad! You can even comment on their interior design sensibilities using the myFloppy Online comment window. Feeling bloodthirsty? Try out some PVP and go head to head with other Floppies, or team up with a zerg of other players to take on planet-sized bosses! Become a myFloppy legend on our online leaderboards! YOU’RE ADOPTED: Meter management mayhem! Floppy is pretty independent for his age, but he still needs your help to stay happy, healthy, and housebroken. Feed Floppy, play with him, and take him outside to do his business! After you name and customize the little guy, it’s on you as his watchful guardian to make sure he’s raised right! CUTTING EDGE UI: Feeling nostalgic? Our designers have painstakingly crafted a virtual desktop experience that’ll bring you straight back to the sweet, lost innocence of late 90s / early 2000s cyberspace. The immersive UI coupled with Floppy’s hand drawn animations are sure to create a distinct and poignant longing for days long gone.",
