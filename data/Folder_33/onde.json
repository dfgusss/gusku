Yet, life finds its way through the darkness, and by filling the shell, sparks a light. With the light comes a sound, and the waves of this communion propagate in all directions. A new being sets out and follows their lead to discover a world of wonders and witness life unfolding on its way. Will the wee creature get through the dark spaces to find that it is darkness that makes light really shine? Go to Onde's Accessibilty Record",
