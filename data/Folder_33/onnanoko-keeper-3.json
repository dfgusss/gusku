    "About the game": "With a NEW mob, 'ONNANOKO' is back again!! While the game may seem nostalgic at first glance, it's actually a test of your ability to make accurate situational judgments in real time. Rules of the Game The goal is for the player, who is a small robot, to secure a larger area. The player must secure the required area within the time limit to clear the stage. The player can move around the perimeter of the unclaimed area. You have to allow for the speed of movement to be halved as you carve out new territory. There are enemy mobs roaming around in uncharted territory, but from their point of view, they can't do any harm unless an alien player invades. (But that may not necessarily be the whole truth...) Occasionally, things can be found that can help you. Clearing a stage will reveal the entirety of the 'ONNANOKO' record. Specifications More more technical 30 different stages and their rankings. 30 challenging achievements When clearing the game: Time remaining, life remaining, and excess area bonus from the required area. When playing: Bonus for securing a large area at a time, bonus for burying more than one enemy at a time. You can play with a gamepad or keyboard.
