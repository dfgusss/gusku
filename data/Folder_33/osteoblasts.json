    "About the game": "In Osteoblasts, you play as a spooky scary skeleton raised from the dead by a mysterious Cat Witch in a journey to find purpose. You get to choose a class and go on frightening adventures battling your nemesis - the Dogs - who unburied you from the depths below. You'll be faced with various quests, meet friendly skeletons, travel to spine-tingling dungeons and fight monsters to get stronger. The entire world has class-specific quests and several randomized elements that will change as you visit them again. But beware - as a sinister skeleton wandering about, not everyone will accept you. The dead aren't as welcome as they should and it's not even halloween yet. Features: Single character, multiple classes, items, abilities and spells. Randomized loot affixes which change your skills when equipped. Multiple Endings. Barebones battle system. Heartless story. Braindead hard difficulty. MOONANA MESSAGE: Hello, everyone, this is Nana, lead developer at Moonana. We are the developers of Virgo Versus The Zodiac and Keylocker | Cyberpunk Turn Based Action! I just wanted to let you all know that this is not a game developed by the whole team at Moonana, it's developed by our animator, Anglerman and I helped a bit here and there with dialogues and guidance. This game is being published by Moonana as means of assistance to Anglerman, since he despises the bureaucracy behind launching a game, but I deeply endorse his work and wanted everyone to know about it! I hope you guys will enjoy his work as well and cheer for Anglerman's barely alive new game! GAME DEVELOPED BY: ANGLERMAN SOUNDTRACK BY: ELEKTROBEAR",
