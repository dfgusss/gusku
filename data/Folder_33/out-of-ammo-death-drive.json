    "About the game": "Out of Ammo: Death Drive is a hybrid game experience: one part tower defense base builder, one part FPS action. Collect scrap, build emplacements and possess individual units. Make use of whatever you find on the battlefield to shoot, crush and maim the undead hordes standing in your way. Key Features A fully featured campaign spanning seven levels takes the player through post-apocalyptic cities, malls and desolate landscapes in search of safety. Expansive realtime strategy gameplay - manage scrap collection, build and upgrade emplacements and manage your ammo supply. A seamless combination of FPS gunplay and melee action : Possess any unit and get in the fight. Varied enemy types include shambling zombies, necromantic cultists and shoot-on-sight bandits, each with their own unique tactics and approach to combat. Multiple ways to upgrade your emplacements : Build a grenade launcher to decimate large hordes, an automated turret to lay down suppressing fire, or even build a kennel to summon Alby, the magical healing Dog.",
