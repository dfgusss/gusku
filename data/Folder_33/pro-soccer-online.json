    "About the game": "Pro Soccer Online is a 1st/3rd person, highly skill based, online multiplayer soccer game. It offers a sports game experience unlike any other with smooth, physics based, input driven gameplay that is competitive and rewarding with no pay to win mechanics. What makes Pro Soccer Online so good? 1) Input Driven Gameplay Gameplay in Pro Soccer Online is completely input driven, not animation driven like many other sports games. Your decisions and skills on the field are the only thing that matter in this game. 2) Dedicated servers Pro Soccer Online has dedicated servers in NA East (Ohio), SA East (Sao Paulo), EU Central (Frankfurt), and AS East (Seoul) with the potential to add more regions in the future if needed. 3) Matchmaking Pro Soccer Online offers a matchmaking system for you to find a match solo, or with a party of Steam friends. The 2 modes available for matchmaking right now are 6v6, and 3v3 with a chance of more being added in the future. 4) Leaderboards and stat tracking Track your individual stats like goals, assists, passes, etc, and try to climb the skill rating leaderboards to prove who is the best. 5) Custom Lobbies Custom lobbies are available to all players so you can setup a match to be just how you like it. It's great for hosting private matches and offers more options than matchmaking. There is overtime, single keeper mode, team sizes from 3v3 all the way up to a full size match of 11v11. 6) Player customization Customize your player in different ways like choosing your hair and facial hair style, hair and facial hair color, make your own custom shoe design, choose different shirt styles, gloves wristbands, etc. 7) No pay to win mechanics Pro Soccer Online aims to be the most competitive and satisfying sports gaming experience there is. Having pay to win would completely ruin that. There are no pay to win mechanics in Pro Soccer Online.",
