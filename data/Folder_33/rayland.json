    "About the game": "Welcome to Rayland . The inhabitants of this land use the energy from the Domus to survive and to transport this energy they use the Reflectus, which are equipment that reflect their rays to other Domus. Your mission is to help the inhabitants of Rayland to transport the energy of the Domus through the various lands contained in the path. For this, you must correctly position the Reflectus and rotate them so that the energy rays reach the necessary Domus. Use the resources of each level to make the reflected rays reach the Domus. Use the intersection of the rays to generate a new radius for them. Use the mouse to move and rotate the Reflectus. Use the passages between blocks to pass the lasers. Want to spend time relaxing or looking for something to challenge yourself? You're in the right place. Challenges in Rayland range from minor difficulties to challenges that will have you thinking for several minutes.",
