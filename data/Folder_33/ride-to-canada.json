    "About the game": "Ride to Canada is an addictive action-puzzles, in which you will control the rail traffic. In this game you need to use your logical thinking, speed and arcade skills. Plan routes by controlling the switches to unload or unhook all wagons. The railways cross, so you'll have to think how to avoid a collision. Perhaps, sometimes, you will have to even stop the train. Watch out for obstacles! There are tracks that you can drive only once. One false move can cause a railway disaster! Each puzzle has defined time, so hurry up! When you prees RMB game will speed up. There are many solutions, but only the optimal one will give you three stars and raise multipliers for countries. Each country has its own capital, where you will attach wagons and collect points for length and variety of trains. Improving your score in capitals and raising multipliers for countries, will give you higher place on leaderboards. Try to find your own better way. Good luck!",
