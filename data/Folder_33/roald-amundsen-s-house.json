    "About the game": "Roald Amundsen's House remains much as he left it when he disappeared in 1928. The story of one of the world's foremost polar explorers is preserved as if in a time capsule within the walls of his home located in Bunnefjorden, south of Oslo. Amundsen planned and prepared several of his greatest polar expeditions from this house including; the conquest of the South Pole in 1911, the traverse through the Northeast Passage in 1918–1925 and the first overflight of the North Pole in 1926. For the first time ever, you can immerse yourself in the famous explorer's house in stunning state-of-the-art photogrammetry and interact with objects from Amundsen's life and expeditions in virtual reality. This is a photo-realistic recreation of a real-life location, captured in extreme detail and brought to life through spatial audio and interactions. A must-see for anyone with an inner explorer. Roald Amundsen`s House is a part of Follo Museum - The Museums in Akershus (MiA).",
