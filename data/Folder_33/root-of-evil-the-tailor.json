As you roam the house and look for haunted items you will have to face the evil phenomenon can make you startled .... With a great storyline and compelling game puzzle game that you will not be disappointed About This game was developed by only one person. Despite of limited human resources, I always try to give you the best experience while gaming. With spending a lot of effort on graphics and ingenuity in leading the storyboard, I believe that when you’re gaming you will feel like more than watching a movie. The game have the knots of the past of characters which towards the end of the game everything will gradually clear.",
