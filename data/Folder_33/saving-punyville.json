    "About the game": "You are a burnt out fellow living an aimless life. Your grandpa lives in a mansion in town, but long ago kicked you out because of your various personal problems. The townspeople of Punyville, fixated on the treasures of a nearby cave, ventured inside with innocent hopes of fortune. But there were creatures inside. These creatures captured the townspeople of Punyville, locking them in dungeons. It is up to you to venture into those dark dungeons to free them. You will collect treasures along the way, meet new friends, and fight bosses. Buy weapons from Tracy's shop. Visit the alchemist to stock up on potions. Go to the local hospital if you are in need of care. Take a trip to Ecco's castle to learn how to harness the power of magic. Saving Punyville was created by a small team of three people. All of the artwork and music were made with great care. Soundtrack: -punyville-original-soundtrack",
