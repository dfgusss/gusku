    "About the game": "When Harold (or whatever you decide to name him) is sent to a college for people that have no friends, he has no idea what to expect. Not long after arriving, he ends up finding out that the school pairs its students together and when they're together, they're assigned the same room. However, these students don't have to be the same gender and he is high chance of sharing his room with a girl. At this school, he meets three girls that won't leave him alone. The first one we have is Anima, who likes to cause trouble for others. She's always making things hard on her teachers and even her friends have trouble getting her to behave herself. Next is the weird and mysterious, Scout, who happens to be the most innocent and childlike of the three. She's an obsession with the supernatural and an endless appetite. Finally, there's Vivian, the annoying pervert who doesn't really care who is around when she's being inappropriate. Despite her behavior, she does have a bit of a mature side, which usually surprises others. All students must take a survey and then their actions will be observed throughout the day. The choices you make will determine who your partner is. Harold may end up with one of the three girls or with someone else entirely. Since there are three girls, there are three main routes, each with three endings. Whether Harold remains as just friends with these girls or something more depends on the choices he makes. Each of the routes can be completed within an hour. With these three girls, Harold will got caught up in all kinds of messes, learning more about them as time goes by. School For The Friendless is a comedic visual novel with multiple endings depending on how you choose to develop Harold's relationships with the girls.",
