    "About the game": "Spacelair is a retro sidescroller arcade adventure that combines some real life dependencies with old fashion parallax graphics. You are introduced to the town of Juvélåsen, a small coastal village with (among other things) a fishing boat and a spaceship factory. Theme of the story is an apocalypse followed by a narrow escape and some daring space exploration. Remember to buy that fan and some food, and good luck.. ;) Free to play and use as a development platform for other Python Pygame developers, and only 2,99 USD for Windows and Linux users including all future updates. Players are encouraged to comment this game and help the developer complete the Spacelair release adventure.. Sporadic updates based on Community feedback, with improved graphics, gameplay, missions, story ++",
