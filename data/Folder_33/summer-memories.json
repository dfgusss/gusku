    "About the game": "Summer break has begun, and for the first time in years, you're going back to the countryside to visit your family. At first, it doesn't seem like there's much to do so far from the city, but you'll soon find there's more to this quiet mountain village than meets the eye! What worries do your cousins have? Who's the social media sensation taking the small town by storm? What kind of treasure is the mermaid at the beach searching for? And what's up with that weirdo in the gacha mask who's hanging outside the local store?! Solve all these mysteries and more during one unforgettable summer vacation! Manage your days and time during your vacation, get to know the people around town, discover the wildlife, and go fishing. Raise your stats by playing sports or by exploring the local mountain. There are plenty of tasks to do, minigames to participate in, characters to meet, and special events that occur on different dates! Depending on who you befriend, different endings await you. And don't worry if you can't clear everything in a single run of the game. You can start a New Game+ playthrough while retaining all of your stats and unlocked abilities. A Slice-of-Life Game Experience Live through a calm summer vacation while spending your days as you see fit, either by slacking off or by solving the problems of the townsfolk. A Variety of Minigames Go fishing, take part in track activities, keep the house clean, hunt for treasure at the beach, and more! A multitude of activities awaits you! Hand-drawn Art and Sprites Every character in the game, from your cousins to a scientist living in the mountains, has expressive art and fully animated, hand-drawn sprites! Countryside Town to Explore Just like the characters, the maps are drawn in 2D pixel art style, complete with lots of small details to discover. Get immersed in the countryside surrounded by mountains!",
