    "About the game": "Super Squidlit imitates the Game Boy™ Color's capabilities and limitations for a squishy adventure! The colorful world of Squishu and its invertebrate inhabitants need your help! Play as Plip and your old foe, Skwit Skwot, as you set sail to banish a great evil. - Squip your way through the islands of Squishu as Plip, a wee squidlit that can double jump to ink on things below you! - Plip's new roll tackle lets you manipulate foes and gain a burst of speed! - Blast your way through enemies as the wizardly Skwit Skwot, GOD EMPEROR, in ray-casting 3D RPG levels! - Meet lots of goofy Squidlits! Like the first Squidlit game did with the Game Boy™, Super Squidlit adheres to the limitations of the Game Boy™ Color: * No more than 10 sprites in a horizontal line * No more than 40 sprites at any time * 3 colors per sprite * 160 x 144 pixel resolution * 4 sound channels for music and SFX * All sounds were recorded on a real Game Boy™ Color! Can you guide Plip and Skwit Skwot to victory and save Squishu?",
