    "About the game": "You’re set, waiting…. The line tightens, your alarm screams, the fish is on and the battle commences! Take on the hunt of a lifetime as you target and pursue monster sized fish around the world. With 35 species to hunt you’ll have to work up your strategy, skill and tactics to catch every boss fish in each venue. It’ll take both patience and adrenaline to succeed as you choose your angling spot carefully based on time of day, weather conditions and perfect equipment setup, before casting out into the water to battle and catch these elusive creatures. It’s all about the catch. KEY FEATURES: GO SPECIES HUNTING 35 different species of realistically captured fish with their own unique behaviour and bait preferences await you. Every tactic and piece of equipment will be needed to catch them all as you go from float fishing for species such as rudd, ide and bream to using lures for trout, salmon and pike. You can also fish for rare species such as pacu, mekong and redtail catfish. LAND THE BOSS FISH As well as thousands of fish to get your personal bests on all species, there are 125 legendary Boss Fish to hunt including 11 Monster Boss Fish – the hardest fish to catch in the game. These named fish put up a huge fight and only the best will be able to locate and land them all. GET OUTDOORS, INDOORS! Featuring 5 unique destinations that all present their own challenges. Oxlease Lake on the Linear Fisheries complex is a specimen carp water with some great back up species including tench and roach. The River Ebro is home to huge wels catfish and Pearl Lake in Malaysia features exotic monsters such as arapaima and giant wolf fish. Go urban street fishing in Rotterdam city centre or explore the openness of Loch Mickle in Scotland that both contain predators such as pike and zander. ADVANCED WATER FLOW Advanced water flow will affect your fishing whether that’s from the bank or in a boat. Keep an eye on your float drifting downstream or your boat moving off the prime spot that you have identified. ALL THE GEAR, ALL THE IDEAS 100’s of items of equipment from over 20 licensed partners including Nash and Mainline Baits.
