For when he was a teenager he saw his family being attacked by zombies in the village where he lived. Cesar, who at the time of the attack, returned from his daily adventure in the forest, witnessed everything from afar and vowed to avenge all the zombies he encountered along the way in memory of his family. For that to happen, he needed to equip himself with a powerful and deadly weapon to exterminate the zombies with just one blow. So he decided to use the sword inherited from his father for another journey. Time goes by and Cesar is now young, leaving to take his revenge. For his survival, he must seek food, health in the middle of the forest. Having been alone for many years, Cesar cannot relate to anyone, because in the game there are Indians, but out of fear, they run away from Cesar, when he approaches, because of his brownish manner.
