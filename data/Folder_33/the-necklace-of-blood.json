The necklace of blood is a jewel which many would give their lives for, they don’t imagine the power and responsibility of owning it. The necklace has been cursed and bathed in the blood of Satan himself, the necklace was consecrated on the altars of death to cause the madness of men. The evil one has sent a powerful Jackal to this dimension, his son, to be confused among men. The mission of the Jackal is to enforce a prophecy written more than 200 years ago, which points to the moral and religious destruction of a great metropolis, New York. To fulfill the objective, the Jackal recruits men, in different ways, and turns them into vassals at the service of darkness, to spread the plague. An old secret organization, called 'The Council', fights against the power of the Devil, and tries by all means to end the word of evil, written in black books. This is the story of one of those men, manipulated by the black light of death, which induces him to become a vassal and commits him to the ultimate consequences. It is a journey that will take emotions to the limit and make you reflect on the behavior of people in an environment dominated by vanity and consumerism, where moral values are a facade and ethics is a price as solid as personal convenience.",
