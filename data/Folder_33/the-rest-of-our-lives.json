    "About the game": "Story With the arrival of the wealthy Chuck Bing, the city is on fire as the most eligible bachelor has just hit the market. This is good news for Mrs. Bonnet who is looking to get her daughter Liz married off. During their first meeting however, Liz meets Chuck's friend, Mr. Derby, and the two are immediately at each other's throats. Their fates are interwoven in this sexy tale of romance. About: 38,000 word Kinetic Novel (A Visual Novel with no choices for a more causal reading experience.) This story is an adult re-imagining of the romantic/drama novel, Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. It relies more heavily on being an adult fantasy story than a true reenactment of the story to create a more light and fun story for fans of the original work.",
