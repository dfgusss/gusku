Praise for Thunder Kid I “Thunder Kid is like a 3D Mega Man game in an alternate universe where Mega Man Legends never happened and the Sega Saturn won the console wars. Responsive controls and crisp, bright low-poly/pixel art visuals at a smooth framerate, with the sole exception of the final boss, which goes all in on the bullet hell elements teased in prior levels.” “Really solid, clean, and fun arcade-action title with a lot of charm… one of my favorite action games I've played this year. ” “…I can certainly see how this would be a speedrunner's delight.” “Fast Paced Old School Fun at a Great Price” “‘Mega Man meets Crash Bandicoot’. Hidden gem is right. This is a fun behind the back shooter platformer that takes you down corridors of baddies. The bad guys are mixed and matched to make each scenario unique and increasingly challenging.”",
