    "About the game": "Deep Inner Shadow The first-person escape game, in which you will play the role of your dreams, carefully escape from various monsters, hide in the shadows, the sound of heavy footsteps will give you the best hint, if you really can't escape, you can also use your skills to sneak into another piece. In the dark (but you may not be alone there) Levels Of Difficulty As the level deepens, monsters will have different characteristics. The previously seemingly safe hiding spots will become less safe and the difficulty will continue to rise. Listen to the Bell The sound of the bell not only reminds the time, but also reminds the monsters to change. Maybe the hiding spots that were commonly used before should be changed.",
