    "About the game": "Take the control of your favourites politicians (and the not-liked ones too) with this game kinda crazy were they will compite with each other just to win your vote at the tournamente of... wheels?... ¡¡¡YES!!! ¡¡¡WHEELS!!!... like the polician carrers should be, weapons, crashes, a cup of tea, and some other deligment stuffs, and of course the most important thing... Wheels . A kart game, where you can participate at the tournament 'for the soberany of the whole world, and returning the credibility of the democracy' or atleast, to the goodlooking character that you decide to support... With ten simple circuits that emulates real ones, eight characters playables with their unique skiils and characteristics (and ideologies) a style like-ish visual novel, where you will play trying to discover the truth about the big event of the Wheel around the world, and who is behind this circus. A simple game, a simple idea, I have tried to finish it within two months, but got some issues within the development, and the time goes by, a month later aproximatelly the game can be released, or atleast trying to release it as indie solo dev... the time was one of the worst enemy that existed for this project, and made that even hardest to be finished. The game has humor at its bases, I hope taking in consideration that they race over literally Wheels, there is no need to say, the game is just fiction and didn't try other thing, hoping too that the idea of 'Wheel races' is something new or something I didn't heard about, the game didn't pretend to be 100% realistic in any ways, and so on... either the characters and other things.",
