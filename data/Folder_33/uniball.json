    "Name": "UniBall",
    "Release date": "Feb 24, 2017",
    "About the game": "One of the longest running independent games on the Internet, UniBall has evolved from a simple version of space hockey into an online multiplayer e-sport that is uniquely its own. The basics remain simple and easy to learn: you maneuver, you pass and you shoot in order to score goals. But beyond this simple design lies a surprisingly complex game involving teamwork and individual skill that can take a lifetime to master.",
