    "About the game": "Selected for PAX Rising at PAX South 2018 and 'Best Let's Play!' category at DreamHack Austin 2018! 'You are being stalked by evil dolls in an old black-and-white film...' Witchkin is a first-person 'hide-and-sneak' survival horror game in the vein of Slender or Five Nights at Freddie's. The player takes the role of a child attempting to find his abducted little sister in an abandoned Texas farmhouse in the 1920s. This house is home to the Witchkin--a family of terrifying toys, the children of a deranged woman known as the Candy Lady. Using her “children” she will do everything in her power to keep all who enter the house from ever leaving. The base play mechanics of Witchkin are primarily stealth. Sneaking, hiding, staying quiet and aware of the toys and your surroundings are skills required throughout the game. Witchkin boasts a very strong and unique art style reminiscent of early silent movies, painted in the eerie sepia tones of postmortem photos and the murky shadows of nightmares. Witchkin is a one-man show, only one person created the game: art, music, voice (with a little help from family members), and programming.",
