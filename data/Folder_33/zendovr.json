    "About the game": "ZendoVR is a walking meditation in the woods. The player is led along a set path in the woods and around some ponds for about 32 minutes. At intervals the walking stops and a though about meditation is presented. One can stop (down arrow key) any time and just sit and meditate. Find your favorite place. You can control time of day, music, sounds, dialog, walking speed, and graphics detail. Controls Why I wrote ZendoVR in 2016 as an idea I had for VR and meditation. It is what I wanted in a VR experience. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I do. Many thanks to Gil Fronsdale. I am a follower though we have never met.",
