    "About the game": "Introduction The daughter of a wealthy man who fell into a coma after falling into a deep, dark dream. NIGHT DIVE, a machine that separates body and consciousness, was developed to rescue her from her nightmare. One man DIVES into the girl's dream in exchange for an unbeatable reward. Will he be able to hide from the threats lurking in the nightmares, rescue the girl safely, and escape...? Features Everything is random, so it depends on luck to some extent, but it's not a luck game where you can't or can't clear a level by luck. First of all, it is very important to read notes to know the characteristics of items and enemies. It may seem quite difficult until you get used to it, but if you play it over and over again, your previous experience will be put to good use, so take your time. Dungeons Randomly generated dungeons that are different every time you play. Rooms, furniture, door locations, and item placement are all random. Even in similar rooms, the placement of paintings and accessories are all different, so keep a close eye on your location as you move. Items There are various items that are necessary for escape and items that help you survive. The items are all randomly placed, so the timing of finding them and choosing what to bring can make the difference between life and death. There are also multiple random passive and secret items that have lasting effects. Enemies Four different Enemies with different characteristics that respond to sound and light, and a rare, vicious special Enemy. Enemies are also different each time you play, and each time your spirit is tainted, another additional enemy is summoned. Escape You can escape from three different types of rooms that are different from the other rooms. However, in order to escape, you must prepare several items necessary for each escape room and bring a girl with you. The selfishness of being able to escape as long as you find a room is not allowed. Death Employs the so-called Permadeath, the one death rule, where if you die once, you lose everything. The same dungeon and item placement cannot be played twice. Time limit, fear value and mental pollution 44 minutes and you will be swallowed by an unconditional nightmare and death will be waiting for you. Fear will hobble you, and if your mind is contaminated, additional Enemies will be summoned.
