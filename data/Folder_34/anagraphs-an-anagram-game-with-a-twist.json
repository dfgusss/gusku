    "About the game": "A new twist on anagrams, Anagraphs is a free puzzle designed to challenge your linguistic and spatial skills. Anagraphs extends the concept of anagrams by including letters that can be rotated to make other characters. In a typical anagram the letters can be re-arranged to form new words ('ma' and 'am' for example) but in Anagraphs, the 'm' character can be rotated to form a 'w' which allows for the word 'aw' to be included. Built with a specially designed font with several characters that can be rotated in such a way, Anagraphs is a challenging linguistic puzzle where you must optimize paths to earn stars used to unlock new levels. Anagraphs is a spiritual successor to the popular word game, Synonymy . Anagraphs is free, with open source on GitHub. It was developed by Cinq-Mars Media , an educational non-profit with projects and games featured at E3, PAX and festivals worldwide. Discord Join our server:",
