    "About the game": "Ashes of the Night takes you on a fantasy adventure- filled with monsters, mayhem, and snarky banter. Players will enjoy a wide variety of classes that allow them to maximize their gaming experience, along with a large list of gear for those who love tweaking and tinkering their characters to a specific design. Much work has been done to bring forth the things we enjoy and avoid the things that we all hate about RPG's. Minimal farming is required. This is a story game, which does not concentrate heavily on grinding out mobs, but instead on character development and helping you get attached to your favorite characters. Heroes move through a tortured world encountering unique people with their own problems &amp;hardships- a disaster caused by an ego maniac that calls himself 'The Master'. The adventure takes place with the goal to put this narcissist to rest. *Disclaimer* This game is ugly and hilarious. The beginning can be rocky so take your time to figure out how the game works and what it's about. The jokes unfold as the story progresses.",
