    "About the game": "BOOM Bound is a Fast-paced, Real-time, Strategic Movement and Pattern game where you can play online with up to 6 friends. The goal of the game is to have the player get across the map by dodging repeating explosions and moving objects. Inspired by one of the best real-time strategy UMS category (bound) of all time. This game currently has : 100 unique levels that will keep you busy for hours! 8 unique explosion patterns and level themes! 7 Player skins! True cross-platform/cross-device online multiplayer play (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS)! In the future, I plan to add these high-level features : Endless Mode v1 ( There are no safe zones and the Area is the level. You don't have time to prepare and must dodge by memorizing where to go in a trial-by-error style fashion ) Endless Mode v2 ( Player Spawns on the level with one life and upon beating it, will take them to the next level (or else they start over) ) 13 More Levels with Explosion Patterns Leaderboard/Achievements Level Editor Allow players to host private &amp; public lobbies to show off their custom-made levels",
