F18 and Destroyer Operations: &gt; Intensify your engagement against the enemy by Flying your own F18 fighter or take control of your Destroyer's and annihilate incoming threats. &gt; Launch your F18 into the skies using guns, unguided and guided rockets, bombs and destroy incoming planes, ships and submarines. &gt; Take Control of your destroyer to search and destroy incoming submarines, destroyer's, battleships and enemy jets. The money you earn each Level is used as your starting funds for the next round of challenges. Therefore, limiting your purchasing of Fighter Jets and Upgrades greatly improves your starting funds for the next level.
