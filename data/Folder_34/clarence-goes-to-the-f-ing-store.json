    "About the game": "About the Game A short, absurdist comedy choose-your-own-adventure game with a massive cast of bizarre characters, multiple endings, and a plethora of ways to be a generally unpleasant human being. Perform open-heart surgery! Rob an alien! Start the apocalypse! The choices--and consequences--are all yours! Seven zany endings await in this world of notebook-doodle visuals and wry humor! 'Oh no, Clarence, you're all out of Milk!' Take on the role of Clarence in his heroic quest to go to the store and buy milk. It's only a quick walk down the road; I'm sure a full cast of quirky characters definitely won't stop you along the way to inundate you with insane problems and an obtuse trading quest leading to seven unique endings! ...After all, what are the odds of that happening?",
