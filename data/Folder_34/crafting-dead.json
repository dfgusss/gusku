    "About the game": "Fight or flight! It's up to you! Crafting Dead is in EARLY stages of development! Overview: Crafting Dead is a multiplayer-based survival game with a voxel and bright theme. You are placed in a Zombie Apocalypse where the cure is obtainable! Look for loot, craft special items, and fend off the endless masses of zombies! Customize your character with different types of armor, weapons, and content found around the map. The only limit to the success of your survival is another's bullet. Good luck. History: Crafting Dead started out as a fun little single-player mod for Minecraft. Roughly 6 months after release, around the time of The Walking Dead, the mod went multiplayer with custom servers. From there, things would never be the same. After roughly 3 successful years of development in Minecraft, a standalone was starting to brew. As the community demanded more advanced content, Minecraft was limited and a standalone was born! Here we are today!",
