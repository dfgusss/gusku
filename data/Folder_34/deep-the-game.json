You are a cave explorer who accidentally falls in a pit which leads to a big cave system. After some exploration, you find remains of an old civilization that used to live there, but they are long extinct, but the cave is still populated with Bats, Slimes, and other kinds of creatures. Explore the cave and find secret rooms, chests, coins, and more treasure that is hidden deep into the cave. Find your way out of the cave while wall jumping, climbing, sliding, or swimming. While exploring the cave, you encounter some weird creatures. The slimes, bats, and the Patrol Monster are the enemies you must avoid to get safely outside! After hours of climbing, jumping, and swimming you find the exit and return to your home.",
