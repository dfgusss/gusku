    "About the game": "I’m not sure about this one, I shouldn’t really be selling it. A customer brought it in this morning and, apparently, it’s not working correctly. He said it didn’t make much sense to him, but I don’t know what his expectations were. You know what this kind of trip can be like for some people. Anyway, it’s supposed to be varied, a few locations, a nice hotel and not too crowded. I think there’s even some wildlife. I should return it to the company, but if you’re just looking to get away for a bit, I can give you a good discount. That would save me the effort of sending it in. Obviously, there are no guarantees as I haven’t tested it myself. So, you’d be on your own with it. You’re ok with that right? _________________________ Defective Holiday is single player, first person, lightly interactive will take under an hour to complete. As you play, you’re pulled between different scenes – a beach, departure lounge, restaurant, taxi and more - present in each location for only a fleeting moment before being moved on to the next. Featuring original music by Mechatok",
