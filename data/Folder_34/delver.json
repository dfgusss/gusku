    "About the game": "Delve into the shifting dungeons on your hunt for the Yithidian orb, but getting it might just be the easy part. Delver is a single player first-person action roguelike dungeon crawler, just like you wished they used to make. Slay monsters, blast wands, hoard potions, and loot everything. A silky smooth mix of 90s FPS combat with classic RPG mechanics. In these dungeons once you're dead you stay dead. Permadeath means that when you die, you begin each run into the dungeon anew. Tough as nails gameplay will test your skills, no grinding will save you here. A procedural dungeon that will keep you on your toes, no two runs will ever be the same. Delicious chunky pixels! Easy to pick up gameplay, but difficult to master. The dungeon has been waiting for you.",
