    "About the game": "VR DINOSAURS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THEM It is time to head to the distant past, when herds of dinosaurs roamed the land and no creature was safe from the next larger predator. Familiarize yourself with the grazing, pack hunting, swimming, and fleeing dinos. You never know where the next threat may lerk. So load up in our safe high tech launch and reception centers, relax, and enjoy your trip through DinoTrek where nothing can go wrong, go wrong, go wrong. HIGHLIGHTS -Look everywhere: there are new things to discover all around . Move around, you can get closer or further away from the action just by leaning in or using different modes, camera recentering, and teleporting -Over 50 dinosaurs to see with high quality detail, motion, and sound will make you feel like you are truly living in prehistoric times. Land, water, and sky... no place is safe from the threat of dinosaurs. MODES -Normal Mode: Travel around in your vehicle (POD) through a land of full size dinosaurs. -Fun-Sized Mode: Travel through a land of toy sized dinos. It is less threatening for the kids and a fun different way to check out the land of DinoTrek. A gaze menu gets you started. Recenter your headset using the 'R' on your keyboard (controller 'grip'). Use the keyboard 'spacebar' to restart or change modes ( controller 'menu button'). 'X' lets you toggle between riding with the POD and being left behind (controller 'trigger'). Once you disconnect from your POD (if you are using a controller) you can click the 'trackpads' to teleport all over to see all the things you may have missed and get a closer look some of our ancient friends, but be quick before time runs out on you. Now it's time to test your dinosuar knowledge and see if you can identify all the different kinds!",
