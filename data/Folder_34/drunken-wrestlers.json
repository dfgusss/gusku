    "About the game": "WARNING : ONLY PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU'RE CURIOUS WHERE DRUNKEN WRESTLERS 2 CAME FROM OR FEELING NOSTALGIC. THIS IS NOT A GOOD GAME ON ITS OWN Recently, this game was removed from Google Play Store . As a result, there is now barely any trace of it left on the internet. By releasing it on Steam , I'm hoping to fix that. It would also give some context to Drunken Wrestlers 2 . Original Description: Minimalistic ragdoll fighting game about drunken wrestlers, created in 7 days for NextCastle DevCup 2013 contest. The goal is to force your opponent to lose balance, or inflict critical damage. The match goes to 5 wins. This game has an option to play together on one device! This game was made when I was 16.",
