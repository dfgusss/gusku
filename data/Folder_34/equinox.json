    "About the game": "Equinox is a free-to-play, fast-paced multiplayer arena shooter. Equinox mixes advanced movement techniques and projectile-based combat, producing a high-skill combat system. The game's objective is to capture the enemy's flag with adjustable team size, max score and match time. Developed initially as a school project using Unreal Engine with a group of programmers and artists, the game evolved into something more. Key Features Objective-Based Gameplay The objective of both teams in Equinox is to capture the enemy's flag. The opponent's flag is located in the opponent's base. The flag can also not be scored if both are currently being carried. Physics-Based Weapons The weapons that the player can utilize in Equinox resemble dodgeballs. Once thrown, the dodgeballs will bounce around corners and if travelling slow enough, can be picked up. Various Weapon Types There are three types of dodgeballs in Equinox. First, there is the standard dodgeball which the player always has access to. This dodgeball deals a flat amount of damage. Special dodgeballs spawn around the map at critical locations. The special dodgeballs include fireballs, which deal damage over time, and iceballs slow the target for a duration. Abilities There are three abilities that the player can utilize throughout the match. The first ability is a ball repulsor, which protects the player from any dodgeballs for a duration. The second ability is a dash, which allows the player to move quickly in a desired direction. The third ability is a strafe, which enables the player to gain momentum and direct their air movement. Online Play The game can be played online with 2 to 8 friends via lobby hosting. When hosting a lobby, the host can define the team size, max score and match time. The game also utilizes VOIP, with a proximity voice chat system to communicate with other users.",
