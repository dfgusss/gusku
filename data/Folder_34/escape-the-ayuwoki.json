Escape The Ayuwoki is a first person horror-adventure game, in which you must escape from a haunted mansion as quiet as possible to evade the hideous creature called 'The Ayuwoki' . Stealth will be your ally. This videogame is a new refreshing experience of the 'Ayuwoki' creepy-pasta/meme inspired prototype, that we previously made. In this version, we tried to create a more unique and surreal atmosphere, around the main story of the game. Your main goal is to escape by solving puzzles and finding different items around the mansion, that will assist you as you make your way out of this haunted place. Prepare yourself for a terrifying, surreal and gory experience in Escape the Ayuwoki. Escape as soon as you can and try to survive in this immersive horror experience where the Ayuwoki can hear you through your mic.",
