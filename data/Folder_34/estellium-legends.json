Through their struggles, they paved the way for future generations to enjoy peace and prosperity. Monsters were eradicated from the world forever and tranquility was instilled across the land. This lasted for about 100 years until Goldea, the God of Rage came forth. In a moment of his mighty anger, he swiftly summoned ferocious beasts upon the land. They began killing anything in their path. The land was as it had been almost a 100 years ago. The God of Rage had issued this Edict; 'If any among you in this world is strong enough. Come destroy me, if you have the power, you can reclaim your world.' With those words leaving his angry lips. Adventurers from all over set forth towards the God of Rage who sits atop the Tower of Burning Rage. Many have tried taking the God of Rage on, but all have perished. Who, if anyone can stop him? A young man named Aserel hopes to become the answer to that burning question. Only time will tell.",
