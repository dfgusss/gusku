    "About the game": "Gameplay Generalization: If you like games with a challenge (like Dark Souls or Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice) , like open world games with almost complete freedom (like Terraria) , like the micro-aspect of RTS-style games (like Starcraft 2) , and like RPG games where you have an incredibly large amount of options for various playstyles (like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim) , you'll feel right at home with Fragment's Moonrise . The game is as difficult as you make it; do you prefer minimal upgrades and few units for a serious challenge ? You'll be in for a very hard game . Do you prefer upgrading things as far as you can take them ? And making use of your newly-acquired wide variety of spells ? The game will be quite simple . We've designed the game to be largely dynamic , but still have a core challenging aspect requiring you to dodge and control your units respectively, even if you are horrendously over-leveled. Fragment’s Moonrise is a randomly generated open-world real-time strategy game, emphasizing spellcasting, micromanagement-oriented unit control, dodging, and overall fast-paced gameplay. Explore a Randomly-Generated Open World- The world is vast, and completely randomly generated. No two Maps are the same, allowing for an even greater replayability experience. Gather Resources and Build an Army- Use discovered resources to build your base and your army, and wage war against the vast enemies of this land. As you explore, you will fight powerful foes and acquire wondrous artifacts. Use these to bolster your army, research new spells, and advance your warriors even further down their class path. Wage War- At the heart of Fragment’s Moonrise is waging war against the multitudes of foes of the land. Never stop moving- movement is key to avoiding attacks from enemies while still striking at them yourself. Invoke powerful spells to your advantage- there are many different beings at your disposal, each with a multitude of unique spells. Making use of their talents is the only way to come out successful, and to defeat even the strongest of enemies. Discord: Questions? Concerns? Critiques? Bugs?
