    "About the game": "Gaikokujin No Sensei (Foreigner Teacher) is a fully voice acted romance visual novel with multiple routes. The main character is an American who was recently fired and has no prospects. The only job he can find is teaching English in Japan and decides to go, despite knowing nothing about the culture or not even speaking a word of the language. Upon arriving in this new country, he happens upon a very strange pair of spirits which he is stuck with for the next year. Will he be able to stick it out through the year or will the two spirits drive him crazy? This game DOES contain fanservice in it, but there will be an option for a censored version in-game. It will be M rated, but only for the fanservice options. There is no H in this game. - 200k+ words - 40+ beautiful CG's - 4+ romance routes each with their own ending - FULLY VOICE ACTED. No 'partial' voice acting, this game is fully voiced from the word 'Go' (The only exception being the protagonist who is silent for that immersive feel) The Team Writer/Director/Programmer: Brandon Rainsford Artist: Razu / kjus(BRMD_DHR) Background Artists: kurosakikeroro and irsanmiftah Video Editor: zeromaster Chibi Graphics: Kick With Nick Voice Actors Nola Klop as Kotone Elissa Park as Makiko Ann Young as Aina Justine Lee as Fumo Zara Eden as Yuriko",
