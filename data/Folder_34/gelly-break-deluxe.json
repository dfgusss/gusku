    "About the game": "'Gelly Break Deluxe' is a real passion project for us and the re-release of our fun first platformer 'Gelly Break' developed for all ages. Three years after the initial release, we have fulfilled our dream, reclaimed the rights to the IP and are now publishing 'Gelly Break Deluxe' as an indie developer and publisher on our own. 'Gelly Break Deluxe' is nicer and bigger with a proper story and all the features and content we already wished for back then. In 'Gelly Break Deluxe' you have to save the Gellies' home planet from the evil Evil Blob as Gel and Lee. As a team, you have to use all your abilities to survive against the ever-changing enemy types, because the challenging jump'n'run passages can only be mastered together with your partner. The switching mechanics, precise coordination and timing are essential to master the unique boss fights, following the popular gameplay principle 'easy to learn, hard to master'. After the time of 'social distancing', 'Gelly Break Deluxe' is the perfect way to get back together with your loved ones. Whether with parents, kids or friends, 'Gelly Break Deluxe' is the perfect couch co-op fun for players of all ages. - Couch co-op platformer in a cute cartoon look - 16 unique levels in 6 carefully designed worlds - 6 challenging boss fights - Single-player campaign and local co-op mode for two players - An exciting story about the rescue of the Gellies - Achievements - High replay value through alternative paths and changing teammates - Available for Switch, Playstation, Xbox and PC - Remote play via Steam Remote Play is a relatively new feature on Steam, still in beta, that allows you to play local multiplayer games together over the Internet. However, it can happen that the controller of the other player is not recognized. We therefore recommend that you start the game in Steam's 'Big Picture Mode', as this can fix the bug according to Steam. We are happy to be able to offer you PC players this tool exclusively with the help of Steam, despite perhaps minor problems, so that you can also play Gelly Break Deluxe together online.",
