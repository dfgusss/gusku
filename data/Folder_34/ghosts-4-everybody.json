But beware, dead enemies are also able to support their friends. The more enemies you kill, the harder this game gets. Collect gold from fallen enemies and deliver their ghosts to the next shop to get new weapons, potions and upgrades. Features: Four player local coop-mode Dead players become ghosts and can support their living friends Dead enemies become ghosts and will support other enemies (including bosses) Upgrade or buy new weapons in the shop for gold Upgrade your hero by bringing enemy ghosts to the shop Procedurally generated levels Remote Play Together Steam offers to play local games over the internet via Remote Play Together.
