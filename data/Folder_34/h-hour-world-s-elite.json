    "About the game": "H-Hour: World's Elite™ (H-Hour) is a tactical, team-based multiplayer military shooter in which cooperation among players is required for success. Designed as a spiritual successor to the early SOCOM series, H-Hour is a one life game that encourages players to think strategically to avoid waiting in the dead pool until the round ends. The game uses a Third Person perspective to enhance the player's situational awareness and it rewards teamwork. A respawn mode is also offered to allow for player warmups and to help new players adjust before joining the more punishing one life game play. All characters and locations are presented in a plausible, authentic manner. The game characters are inspired by real Special Operations Forces and the maps to simulate real world locations—repurposed and staged for battle. Features: One life and respawn game play 6 official maps and free DLC pack of community maps (a mix of SOCOM recreations and original content) 6 game modes including Elimination, Demolition, Breach, Sabotage, Suppression and Hostage Extraction for play with up to 16 players 6 different characters with 4 camos each to select from 4 dance moves to celebrate your kills A variety of loadouts for weapons and equipment to carry on the battlefield Action system to pickup weapons, open/close doors, plant/defuse bombs, melee, and dance Guns hot activated when near enemy or on clicking right mouse fire button Pick up ammo and equipment dropped by teammates Ladder climb, Jump to climb &amp; Vault on selected objects Hud and compass in game Spectate your teammates when dead In game menus for Team Actions, Options and Weapons Inventory selections Team VOIP &amp; Text communication with channels defined for live and dead players Unique Ranking system MVP award at end of match Lobby entry into matches to allow for Armory access, team switching and options setting Game menus for Achievement, Player and Leaderboard stats tracking Team kill management system Multitude of anti-cheat tools including 'Easy Anti-Cheat' Support for LAN, User Created Rooms &amp; Dedicated Servers Servers support customizations such as weapon class or rank restrictions, allowing Vote to Kick, Friendly Fire, Proxy Chat, number of players and number of rounds per match, one life or respawn, game modes and map rotation, ranked or unranked play, password protection and admin functions.
