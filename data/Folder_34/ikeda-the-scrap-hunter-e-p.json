    "Release date": "Aug 16, 2019",
    "About the game": "In the not too distant future, Scrap Hunters scavenge through the remains of the old world in search of valuable forgotten military technology... and rare metal scrap. Following a tip from an old friend of his landlords, Iggy Ikeda infiltrates an abandoned Neptune Facility in search of the remains of a decommissioned Warthog Mk II tank. You'll need to wall jump, and slash your way through 6 stages of challenging narrow saw blade corridors, security droids and lasers while grabbing as much scrap as you can. Gameplay is simple but hard to master. You can Jump and attack (if you can find the hidden Kaizo blade). Collect hidden and hard to reach scrap to get %100 completion. Ikeda: The Scrap Hunter is a challenging stage based game with no micro transactions or loot box shenanigans. Approximate time time to complete is 45 minutes if you're a pro at these sorts of games. But to get 100% of collectibles may take up to 5-6 hours.",
