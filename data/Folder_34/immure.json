To escape, he must travel through strange doors which lead into other dimensions, filled with tormented souls. Will must choose to save or destroy these wraiths, in order to discover the truth behind the Mansion along with his own fate. GAMEPLAY Explore haunting environments in search of clues to figure out how to escape. Use the Shining Trapezohedron (a mysterious crystal that is bound to Will) to shed light on your surroundings and reveal hidden messages, visions of the past and other secrets.

DEVELOPMENT IMMURE is currently being developed as a passion project by Wither Studios, a small indie team from Pittsburgh.
