    "About the game": "'You are in a closed space craft. Your aim is to survive even though you defeat other passengers.' This is a multiplayer battle royal type FPS game that is casual and easy to play. The aim of the game is to survive and defeat other players as many as possible. As enemy players cannot easily be identified visually because of optical camouflage, try to spot the locations of your enemies, relying on the mini map. The number of bullets is limited, and the amount of oxygen for you to be active in the space craft is also limited. For you to survive longer than your enemies do, you need to collect bullet units and oxygen units that are regularly installed. Collect them by checking the mini map that is displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen. Key WSAD: Move forth / back / left / right Mouse: Change left / right up / down Mouse left click: Shoot a bullet",
