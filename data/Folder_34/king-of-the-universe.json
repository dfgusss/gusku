    "About the game": "In the 24th century BC, the Sumerians have turned the land of Mesopotamia from a simple Cradle of Civilization to the home of empires. It is your mission to take control of the kingdom of Kish and conquer your enemies, in order to become Lugal Kiški, King of the Universe. The Sumerians, or 'the black-headed people' (Sag̃-g̃i-ga in their native tongue), were the first people to invent both civilization and writing. Their well-organised and state-run societies make the perfect setting for a strategic video game. In King of the Universe, you will not only try to conquer your enemies, you will also have to take care of your own people. Through military means you gather land and slaves, and through economic means you build new structures for your people. If your citizens do not produce enough supplies to quench your war machine, you will fail. If you do not protect your citizens from foreign invaders, you will fail. This game is about balance, and only by finding it will you become King of the Universe. Tiles Claim tiles and build or destroy structures. Watch your people go about their day-to-day lives. Wealth Garner Silver and resources, such as Food, Metal and Tools. Troops Build an army, and order your soldiers around. Follow your individual troops with the camera. Slaves Collect slaves when conquering foreign land, and use these to build new structures in your kingdom. Citizens Keep an eye on the hunger and health of your people. Make sure every class in your kingdom has enough money to survive. Pricing Decide the prices of wares in your kingdom, to control the economy to ensure profits for your state. Trade Buy and sell with the other empires, to build relations and gain an extra income for your war machine.",
