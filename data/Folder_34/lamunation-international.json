    "About the game": "PLEASE NOTE: Text style in the screenshots is subject to change, as the build is still under construction. LAMUNATION -International- is a comedy visual novel featuring all that is good and holy in this world: Carbonated drinks. Exotic sportscars. Lovely ladies. A retro '80s-style soundtrack infused with modern EDM bops. A rubber duckie. And over 9000* memes. This is no tearjerker. (Though you might end up jerkin' something else.) It's a thrilling social media success story that puts the 'app' in 'happiness'! (And maybe the 'piness' too...) *Estimated Now, this is a story all about how Luna's life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute So listen to the story I'll tell you how he helped his friends save an old factory In coastal Saint Aria, born and raised With a rubber duckie's how he spends most of his days Chillin' out, maxin', gettin' all snoozy And skipping out of class so he can stay in his jacuzzi When a couple of girls who were heading to class Skydived to his yard and dragged his lazy ass Shoved him into car-- At least it wasn't a van-- And said 'It's time to go to the Academy of Hope Island' Lamune Aoumi : The cool, kind childhood friend. As an only child, she dreams of inheriting the Aoumi Lamune Factory from her parents. She loves Luna just as much as she loves lamune. What's lamune, you ask?

Younger by like five minutes, but the point still stands. She's cunning, clever, and caring. And she loves Luna. Iris 'CH' Prateado : Too cute. Too crazy. A lovely, lively little lady. She loves everyone.... about as much as she loves supersonic attack helicopters. The 'CH' stands for 'The Crystal Heart'. Rayla 'MC' Prateado : Domo arigato Ms. Perfect. The sole chef of the Cherry Crown Diner. Everything she does, she does to perfection. She's gentle, and reliable, and she loves everyone. The 'MC' stands for 'The Million Carat'.
