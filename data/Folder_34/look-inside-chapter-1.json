    "About the game": "Manon finds a book in her parents' attic and finds herself immersed in the past of those close to her to realize that she did not know much about them! On each page, browse the memories of a new member of Manon's family, to get a glimpse of who this person was at different times of her life . Put names on the faces and build family ties by cross-checking their memories to piece together Manon's complete family tree. Search each page for happy actions or blunders, rich or failed experiences, to learn more about those who accomplished them. It's up to you to find all these details to piece together the family puzzle! Step into the characters' shoes by acting their own way through puzzles and riddles that will appeal to your aesthetic sense and empathy. Browse at your leisure, without fear of what you may discover! looK INside is not a puzzle game; no mystery, no heavy family secrets. We offer you a fun, frank and fulfilling experience that is part of the vein of a calm and soothing activity. With KIN, we are doing a little homecoming, a tribute to these men and women who have made us as we are, with their qualities and their faults but above all with their humanity. Here is our fable on transmission and memory, mixing literary and graphic arts, giving an air of poetry to these people we know so well and so badly at the same time! Warning ! Some puzzles are based on color perception The game is episodic and will have paid DLCs with new content in 2022",
