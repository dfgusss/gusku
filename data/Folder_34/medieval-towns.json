The game in early access stage and not all features are implemented at the moment. Please, read Early Access section. There is a huge world divided by biomes into four big parts and four starting locations for players in this game (planned to be implemented in the future). First you have to survive in wild nature, you have to care about hunger, thirst and temperature (planned to be implemented in the future). Next you could gather different resources: wood, stone, etc. All of them you need to make tools, weapons and to build towns. There are a social relations in the game too. Players can join guilds. Warlords can set standing to mark enemies or allies (planned to be implemented in the future). You can hire NPC for your group to defend you or to attack your enemies (planned to be implemented in the future). Main game feature is building of towns. You can build up a town with buildings such as: Townhall (performs the administrative function: set the tax, etc) Tavern (provides the mercenaries) (planned to be implemented in the future) Market (provides a possibility for trading activities, in progress) Forge (provides services for improving of weapons) (planned to be implemented in the future, but there are the furnace and workbenches in the game now) House of lumberman (provides a bonus to gather wood) (planned to be implemented in the future) Siege workshop (provides a possibility to make siege machines) (planned to be implemented in the future) ... and a few other buildings. The paid taxes and different resources are stored in the Townhall. And this building will attract the raiders. To defend it, you have to build walls, towers and hire guardians (planned to be implemented in the future, but there are walls and gate in the game now). And finally - the war! A war for resources, towns and glory! The combat system is supposed to be 'non-target' in this game. So, you will survive, gather, build and fight!",
