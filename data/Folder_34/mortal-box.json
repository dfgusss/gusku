    "About the game": "In this game, you wil have to chase and avoid being catched while moving around a cube in space. This unusual cube create power ups and bring menaces from wich you will need to protect yourself and use to your advantage and obtain/retain the glory of being the champion. For this, the players share 3 cameras (one for each fighter), so you won't only develop fast fingers, but also fast eyes. You can edit the color of the fighters, their names, controls, among other things. Play alone, with a friend or even with 2 (I personally prefer it with 2 friends ;)) Ideal to hang out with friends and improve reflexes.",
