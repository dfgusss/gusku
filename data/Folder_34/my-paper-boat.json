    "About the game": "In “My Paper Boat”, the player takes over control of an eponymous paper boat and steers it through various waters. In the course of this, some challenges are waiting. It is a small game, ideal for the meantime – and thus, My Paper Boat it is a lot of fun. Following an optional tutorial, five varied levels are waiting for the player. The treasure cave, summer garden, forest, desert oasis and canyon are all wonderfully designed and grant an impression into what the Unreal Engine is capable of. Three different game modes ensure that there is no time for boredom while the player manoeuvres his or her little paper boat as unscathed as possible into the haven. In “Collect”, numerous coins spread all over the waters wait for the player to find and collect them all. Shooters can hunt down targets with a little bow canon in “Aim”. And in “Rallye”, one has to master the ways to the harbour along certain markings on time – passing obstacles that do their best to hamper the advancement… A high scoring at the end of each mission does not only unlock new levels, but also new accessories for the boat. Every player can customize the boat with extensions and colours to their individual wishes. Achievements create an additional incentive to perfect each single level. All levels are available in every game mode. A physical damage system takes care of collisions with stones or other obstacles. The game is playable on PC and Mac. 5 wonderful levels 3 different game modes All levels available in every game mode Customizable materials and colours for the boat Customizable extensions for the boat Comprehensive, optional tutorial Achievements Multiplatform",
