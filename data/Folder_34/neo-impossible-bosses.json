    "About the game": "NEO Impossible Bosses is a RTS-MOBA Raidboss rush game in which you (and optionally, friends) utilize a number of heroes to defeat the IMPOSSIBLE BOSSES! Inspired by the original custom map 'Impossible Bosses' by Psyris and many other MMO raidbosses, each boss is a unique, challenging encounter and has their own signature abilities. Features A True RTS-MOBA experience - Face off against bosses in a single battle arena, either single player or optionally with friends controlling multiple heroes. Unique and challenging boss encounters - 10 epic bosses await your challenge, taken on at Normal, Hard, and Impossible difficulties. Each difficulty comes with major gameplay differences in boss abilities, not just simply a hitpoint/damage increase. Multiple unit control - Indulge in the idea of literally micro-managing your raiders. Pick from any of the 6 hero classes available and control a team of up to 6 heroes at a time. If things get tough, do a Tactical Pause and issue new orders, or play online with your friends to share the burden. Interesting Abilities and Items - Unlock new and interesting abilities and earn items to improve your chances of taking down the next boss. Competition - Race up the leaderboards. Be the World First guild to take down bosses, or be the most efficient in score. Replays - Review how others on the leaderboard take down bosses, and incorporate their strategies into your own. Ironman mode - For those who want to play the original game mode, a single defeat in any boss encounter means game loss.",
