    "About the game": "A visual novel different from the usual... When your friend Jimmy gave you a ticket for a cruise, at first you were almost dubious... then, after getting on the ship, you were quite happy to have listened to him! Angela, the singer, seemed like she came right out of a dream, and when you met her, nothing was going to be like the way it was before... - Various bizarre characters animated with more than 200 hand-drawn frames - A story worth almost 20K words, with many surprises! - Angela is indeed beautiful, but... will there be another girl to interact with as well...? - Lots of laughs! - Japanese guest musicians! Masashi Kageyama from Gimmick! and Tsuyoshi Kaneko of Yakuza saga and SEGAGAGA fame! - A fun set of Steam achievements to pursue! - Lots of laughs! - Original music score done with an FM-synth chip (Yamaha YM2151) by Luca Della Regina (Xydonia) - Pixel art backgrounds with native resolutions and color palette from retro-consoles - LOTS OF LAUGHS!",
