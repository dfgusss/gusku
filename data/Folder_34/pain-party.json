    "About the game": "Story After an unfortunate mini golf accident (which led to your immediate demise) you wake up in purgatory. This is not the classical purgatory that we've all read about, but instead it's a game show where the winners get to ascend and the losers get to spend an eternity moderating online forums without any kind of monetary compensation or worse. About the game Pain Party combines that madness of a party game with the mechanics of a souls like and precision jumping. You can either play PvP with up to 24 players or play offline in the single player mode, where you have to beat levels to unlock further progression. Join the discord! Gameplay Stamina management and Item usage The first thing you need to learn is that everything in pain party costs stamina, from jumping, punching, dodging, to even using items. If you run out of stamina you won't be able to do any of that above and you'll also walk slower so keep a close eye on that stamina meter. There a lot of ways to get the upper hand in Pain Party, spawn-able items are one such thing. You might find anything from blunderbusses to time stopping hour glasses. Leveling and weapons After each completed level the player will gain experience points. These points can be used to level up your character. Giving him more speed and stamina. Precision jumping Jumping in Pain Party isn't like in other games. Holding the jump button will make you do high but short jumps, while tapping the jump button will make you do long horizontal jumps. Progress and unlock Winning multiplayer matches and progressing in story mode will help you unlock skins for your character. Unique visual style Choose between three different visual styles. Colorful, which is the default visual style. Retro, which mimics the style of older DS games and retro+ which gives the game a visual style close to gameboy. Features Single player story mode Leveling system that gives your character different bonuses Up to 24 players online free-for-all, or join via steam friends Demanding levels that will test your skills and endurance Painful boss battles Physics based pain Precise movement and combat More than 20 weapons and items to help turn the tide Unlockable hats/masks Three different render modes, normal, retro and retro+",
