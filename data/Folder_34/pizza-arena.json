    "About the game": "Pizza Arena is a chaotic, competitive Cook’n’Slash couch party game. Kill monsters, collect ingredients, bake pizzas and satisfy the spectators with delicious pizza! You can fight other players, throw pizzas at them, ally with them against others or try to avoid conflict - no matter what approach, only one cook can be the best. So gather your friends and step into the Pizza Arena! Pizza Arena combines fighting with cooking elements, and combined with the right stragety your victory is certain. But beware of your friends, because this game is predestinated for trolling. Whether letting the others burn their pizza or stealing their ingredients for your own pizzas, be careful who you are messing with. Or are your friendships that harmonic, that you are fighting the ingredient monsters as a team? Let's figure it out together in the Pizza Arena. Currently Pizza Arena officially only provides a local multiplayer mode, but it can also be played together online with Steam's 'Remote Play Together'. Pizza Arena developed from an ambitious student project of the Master 'Game Engineering and Simulation'. Special thanks to the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien.
