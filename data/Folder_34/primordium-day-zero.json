    "About the game": "DISCLAIMER: When I created this game, my intention was to deliver a sci-fi themed sandbox RPG that would eventually grow into a space sim. Based on initial feedback and requests, I have decided to add new features to give you more content while I finish the seasons. These features include multiplayer content, a campaign, different scenarios/game modes, and various miscellaneous features such as abilities, mini-games, and audio playlists. The status of these features will be visible on the community page. These features should be considered as early access features. The sandbox (found in the scenarios menu by selecting the party games tab and choosing the sandbox game mode) is where most of the stable features will be found. This will still be continually updated, but my focus is on fixing stability issues with the requested features. Please consider this before purchasing the game. THE STORY Millions of years in the past, there was a civilization known as The Maria fighting for survival on a small planet orbiting a star in the Milky Way Galaxy. One day, a small team was excavating the dunes near the solar system's largest volcano and an artifact was uncovered. The artifact led them to a crash site, where an ancient vessel was uncovered, but the message bore a warning written in an unknown dialect. Their attempts to translate it bore a warning, stating that a series of solar flares would strike the planet, eliminating any life that called the planet home. In decades, their planet would be reduced to a barren wasteland as solar winds stripped their withering atmosphere. In an attempt to save their species, The Oculus was developed and with it, The Anima was born. Acting as a virtual hub allowing The Maria to tap into their Unity Network, the Oculus was key to their survival as they traveled to the Homeworld. The Anima would then give birth to millions of artificial bodies that The Maria could control as they explored treacherous new worlds on their journey. Using materials from one of their planets three moons, they constructed a mobile platform that would act as their colony ship. Unfortunately, there were those who saw the destruction of the moon as unnecessary. Political parties and religious groups began to form, and The Marian Empire was fractured with threats of secession and civil war. In an attempt to maintain peace, The Nexus Defense Force was created. You have just been promoted to Commander of The Nexus Defense Force.
