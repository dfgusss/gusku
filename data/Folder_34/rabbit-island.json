    "About the game": "Dear King of beasts, We invite you to join a trip to little islands of jolly forms. We will be thankful to you, the great strategist, if you help us to get rid of gluttonous rabbits. Our resources of carrots and flowers are drying up. You will get access to our best towers, the ones that shoot with popcorn, potatoes and watermelons. A scarecrow and a hand organ also ready to slow down the enemies. We are waiting for your quick arrival. Game features: - Improve and open towers through more than 100 levels. - Visit islands that have the shape of snake, TV, elephant and many more. - Beat rabbits: pirates, sport ones, ghosts and zombies. - Act in the mode 'Towers versus towers', when you can not only defend, but also attack. - Prove your strategy, win medals and become a hero.",
