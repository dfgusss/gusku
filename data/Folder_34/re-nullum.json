    "About the game": "Re-Nullum is a minimalist puzzle game about combining numbers. On each level, you must clear the board by connecting numbered tiles. Click on one tile and drag towards a neighboring tile to connect them. If the numbers match, both pieces are removed. Otherwise, the pieces connect and their values are added together. Be careful not to isolate a tile by connecting the wrong pieces. Now follow this simple logic and try to clear all levels! Key features: - 40 handcrafted levels - Original music composed specially for Re-Nullum - No timers, no scores, no pressure",
