Your mission: to investigate a shady top secret research project. Solve puzzles in a beautiful, high-detail brutalist environment which only becomes more and more surreal as the story progresses. Use an array of hi-tech tools to decipher hidden messages and mechanisms and uncover ever deeper and darker secrets of the facility. But beware of what you may find... Once you discover the truth, will you be able to stomach it? Features: An interesting story that you will need to help unravel as you solve puzzles, scan objects and progress through the Volgravian space station.
