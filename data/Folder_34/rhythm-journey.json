Specifically, the game play focuses on the drum’s kick and snare, which can be described as the ‘boom’ sound and the ‘pat’ sound. Rhythm Journey also contains a variety of genres, rhythms, beats, and techniques (pop, rock, funk, Bossa nova, swing, shuffle, 8-beat, 16-beat, 4/4 beat, 3/4 beat, syncopation, fill-in, etc.) that are used in real music, so you feel as if you’re actually playing the drums. 2. Listen to each character’s story through their song’s lyrics and vocals. Rhythm Journey is a rhythm game with a story. Centered around your main adventure, where you are saving the world of sound by passing the rhythm paths, each song contains various tales about various emotions in an omnibus format. Listen to stories that are sometimes warm, sometimes sad, sometimes about life, and sometimes even philosophical through song lyrics and character vocals. 3. The controls are easy to learn, but hard to master.

As long as you don’t give up and stay determined, you will always be able to make progress until your hard work pays off and you finally beat the level. 4. Enjoy 160 stages and 32 tracks.
