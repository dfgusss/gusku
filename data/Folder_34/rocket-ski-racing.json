    "About the game": "Gameplay Hold the line as your booster rocket pushes you to increasingly insane speeds after every lap in this high speed, unforgiving, 3rd person racer! Watch out for blocks of ice and the edge of the track or you'll explode into a scattered pile of parts. It's all about speed and skill. You must pilot your rocket ski racer on the razor's edge. One small mistake and you're off the track, exploding into a million pieces. Drift off the fast line and an opponent will edge their way around you. Game Modes Race Bump and bash 9 other rocket ski racers to stay on the track fast line and finish 1st! Races are either 3 or 5 laps. Gate Chase Simple, fly through gates to earn points, but there's one small catch. The gates are racing around the track too! Race Format Single Race Hone your skill and prepare for a run at the season championship! Season 24 Races on 6 different tracks. 12 Gate Chases and 12 Races. No do overs! Earn the most championship points and become king of the leaderboard! Tracks Story It's the distant future and the planet has changed. Now a frozen hellscape man has retreated and built a new civilization deep underground. How do these tech savvy neo cave people entertain themselves? By watching Rocket Ski Racing of course! A beautiful blend of rockets and the ancient sport of stock car racing. Everyone wants to see their champion come in first and if that doesn't happen then they love to see them CRASH &amp; BURN!
