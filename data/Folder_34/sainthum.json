    "About the game": "Do you like TPS games? Do you like zombie games? Are you too afraid to play zombie games ? Now, you have an unmissable choice: [Sainthum]——a cartoon zombie TPS game. And, roar is DPS in the game. Game background In the Second World War, due to the use of biochemical weapons, a horrible biochemical infection appeared. When people realized the threat posed by the infected, the Second World War had to die. Unfortunately, it was too late. Infected people have a very strong ability to infect, so every time they pass through a place, the number increases exponentially. In just a few years, the infected have completely occupied all continents. but among those infected, a few still maintain their sense. They have acquired some special abilities due to infection mutations, and they have become immune to infections themselves, becoming the most suitable candidates for fighting infections. They are called sainthum. They are the greatest support for human survival. The surviving people, under the cover of the sainthum, scattered and moved to the islands deep in the ocean to rebuild their homes. This story happened on one of the islands.
