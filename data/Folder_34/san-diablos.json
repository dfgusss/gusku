    "About the game": "Play as a Detective-Exorcist in the always-dark city of San Diablos. At the behest of your boss, perform exorcisms in 3 different locations in the city. However, the creatures of the city will not let you do as you please. This game is a Horror-Time-Trial. Your boss has given you 60 minutes to do your job, or else suffer the consequences. Travel to different areas around the city and locate areas that require exorcism. Engage in First-Person combat with different types of monsters of the dark as you attempt to clear each area, all the while making sure your timer does not run out. Use your time wisely, as there are no Save States, and no second chances.",
