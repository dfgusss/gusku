    "About the game": "Step forth into Petura. A world ravaged by the 'War of the Gods' and carved into factions, divided and trying to survive. As a Nomad you traverse this battle torn land, attempting to find your place. Sanctum Breach: Rebirth is an Endgame focused ARPG with deep loot, customisation and build paths. Play how you want, the way you want and strive to overcome the challenges of this dark and brutal world. Key Features Dual Classes: At release there will be 6 base skill trees which can combine to create 15 Classes in total, with access to both skill trees. With over 40 skills and passive effects per tree, that is a lot of customisation! Combine the Minions and Summons of the Necromancer with the Companions of the Hunter to create an unstoppable army of servants? Or perhaps the Elemental control of the Mage with the primal fury of the Shaman to become one with nature and destroy all before you? The choice is yours! Loot: There is already thousands of items waiting for you to collect, with thousands more to be added. Loot comes in multiple tiers and with over 50 unique stat affixes you will be hunting for that perfect item for many happy hours of slaying enemies! Endgame: With a whole host of Endgame content planned, there will always be unique and fun challenges to overcome. Whether it's hunting down the Minotaur in his maze, battling the rebirthing Phoenix or conquering an ancient dungeon deep below the surface of the world, loot and glory awaits all up to the task!",
