    "About the game": "Slimesphere is an isometric turn-based tactics game, where the goal is to kill the enemy slimes within 3 rounds. Its deterministic mechanics make the levels feel like puzzles, and you have to figure out the best strategy to win! Usually, when outnumbered by enemies, you have to rely on traps to beat the AI. Spikes, crossbows, treadmills, launchers, etc. As the difficulty increases, the player has to pay more and more attention to the surroundings, and take advantage of that. There are 12 levels and 14 achievements; if that's not enough, you can create your own maps with the in-game level editor!",
