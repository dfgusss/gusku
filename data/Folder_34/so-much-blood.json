Supercharge your armor, discover new powerful weapons, and kick some ass, as you fight through treacherous hordes of enemies. Can you survive the bloodbath? Try not to lose your shoes when you get thrown into a chaotic world without any kind of direction. Suddenly surrounded by dangerous enemies, your instincts set in with only one goal in mind: survival. You start out with a base set of Tier 1 weapons: the 'Pistol', 'Ray Gun', and 'Shotgun'. With the shopkeepers help (Greg) you may choose to upgrade your tier of weapons or invest in a set of armor. The overwhelming wave of enemies forces you to maneuver your way around this hazardous game world in order to reach safety.
