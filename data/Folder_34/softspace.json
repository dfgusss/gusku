    "About the game": "We're updating our trailer soon to reflect the new Softspace! Softspace is a new kind of productivity and collaboration tool for creative people. Computers are fantastic. They give us superpowers. But every phone and laptop is limited by the same thing: its tiny, flat display. All that information, locked away inside. Spatial computing  sets it free. Spatial computing means interacting with digital things in 3D space. It's a new way of using a computer inspired by a very old place: the physical world. That's why you're already so good at it. Learn more at  . Help Us Build Softspace Softspace is being built by creative coders  Yiliu Shen-Burke  and  Daniel Massey . We're making the productivity tool that we wish had existed back when we were studying and working as designers. Spatial computing is an exciting new medium that's still in its infancy. As we build Softspace, we're constantly challenging ourselves to work from first principles. Often, a building block we need doesn't exist yet—so we have to invent it. The way to find out which of these inventions work, and which need rework, is to get Softspace into your hands. We're eager to make Softspace better and more useful with your input. See what we're working on next. Questions and feedback welcome at hi@softspace.io . Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , and Instagram for tips and updates. Let's Get Started!
