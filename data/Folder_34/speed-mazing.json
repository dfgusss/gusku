Speed Mazing is amazingly accessible for all players. Rules are easy to pick up and controls are very simple. The matches will keep you on your toes, though. Get ready for some seriously exciting battles! Per-player handicap settings allow you to balance players with different skill levels. No one around to play with? No problem - add up to three 'artificially intelligent' bots and practice your skills on all the available stages. Perfect game to play with your kids!
