    "About the game": "STARBO tells you the story of a dead man's journey through a horrendously blue world filled with strange messages and beings all trying to tell you a story, the story of Leo Cornell. Leo Cornell was just another regular working-class guy, trying to make a living under horrendous circumstances due to his evil patronizing boss, Jorge Blue. Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the very same day that Leo got himself fired, he also realised that his very own existence had come to an end. STARBO is a short, story-driven horror game based on the story of a man’s journey beyond death. You'll get to explore a brand new world, find hidden keys and solve puzzles all under the pressure of bloodthirsty creatures wanting nothing other than your failure.",
