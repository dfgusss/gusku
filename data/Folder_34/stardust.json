    "About the game": "A Relaxing Journey Through The Universe Inspired by the fantastic colorful nebulas stretching across the vast emptiness of space, stardust lets you travel through space and paint the canvas that is the universe with your trail of star dust. You collect different colored particles, steadily growing your trail - in size and in color. No goal, no aim, just floating and relaxing and enjoying the view. stardust is influenced by sci fi books like The Martian Chronicles by Bradbury or Foundation by Isaac Asimov. It is made to reflect the atmosphere of eternal loneliness - instilling a feeling of silent terror, beauty and awe. PS: Who else is excited for the pictures by the James Webb Space Telescope?",
