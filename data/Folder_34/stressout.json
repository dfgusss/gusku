    "About the game": "Ever wanted to destroy everything around you? You see, it's in our blood, or at least it was when we were kids, to try and break things. Then we were taught we're not supposed to do that as people tend to get pissed off at you. If you break stuff as an adult, you'll have to reimburse the owner and perhaps even get a fine from the authorities. Welp. That's why we created StressOut, a world where you can go beyond the limitations of the real world... but there's a catch! An evil AI villain has frozen things in time and the world became grey and dull. It's up to you to bring it back to life by having fun and creating as much chaos as possible while racing against the clock. Great way to experience what VR can offer Supernatural feel with amazing superpowers More destruction = more rewards! Earn upgrades and evolve your play style Carefully watch your surroundings and find hidden areas Valve Index Finger tracking to the max Use your hand and fingers to create intuitive gestures. It's one of the first games ever to apply multi-finger tracking on Index controllers to use (and not just visually). Experience VR in all it's majesty! New Arcade Mode Fast paced destruction where levels are generated every time you start. No two runs should be the same. Experience a variety of upgrades with rouge lite elements. This is what we are currently focusing on as it seems to be much more fun than legacy mode! Legacy Mode Slow paced, puzzle with a nice touch of destruction sprinkled on top. For those of you who like to uncover every nook and cranny.",
