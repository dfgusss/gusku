    "About the game": "Master the ancient martial art of ping-pong in this colorful retro kung fu fantasy epic! This fighting-game homage infuses mechanics like blocks, parries, and special moves into classic arcade-style gameplay that is easy to learn but hard to master, only requiring the use of 4 directional inputs and a single attack button. Meet a diverse cast of monstrous warrior-women each with unique gameplay mechanics, special moves to master, and her own story to tell! Fight your way across a slew of different battlefields with special obstacles, hazards, and features that give an edge to fighters than can think on their toes and strategize around them. Play by yourself or with a friend! Go head-to-head with local VS mode, or take on computer controlled opponents by yourself. Takkyu Tournament Re:Serve is currently in early access, so characters and content are subject to change as we work to expand and improve the game with your input.",
