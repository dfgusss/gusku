    "About the game": "'ThinkToDie' is a different and creative casual puzzle game where you have to find a way to die in order to pass the level. To do so, you have to master different situations, combine objects, and time your actions. The game starts with a small introduction/tutorial. The more levels you pass, the harder they will become, the more players you will have to kill, the more you will have to think. Puzzle your way through over 145 levels. Furthermore, you have an option to skip any level in case you get stuck in one of them. Meanwhile in all other games your main goal is to survive, in 'Think To Die' it`s exactly the other way round. If you love puzzles, classic and old-fashioned entertaining games, then this might be one you would enjoy a lot. The game itself was inspired by the Karoshi Series, adding new puzzle mechanics, interesting puzzles and a lot of new features.
