Original Funk Lord (and co-creator) Greg Johnson is back at the helm with the sequel that ToeJam and Earl fans have been waiting for! The iconic ‘90s duo is back in the groove with all-new presents to help them navigate this wack planet 'Earth' and retrieve all the lost pieces to the Rapmaster Rocket. Team up for 4-player co-op play to discover secret locations, hidden presents and new friends as you make your way through a constantly changing and unpredictable world!

Explore to over 30 groovy tunes including unforgettable remixes and new funky fresh basslines performed by musical funkmeister Cody Wright. Use everything at your disposal to unlock all the secret goodies--new presents, power hats, characters, levels and more. Just remember, some things may be a little… unpredictable. Don’t say we didn’t warn you! Return to the HyperFunk Zone to power up your character or freestyle awesome beats in the classic rhythm matching mini game.
