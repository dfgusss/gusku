    "About the game": "Toolnich Village, a Retro, 2D level-based game similar to an RPG. It has an original story that you will find out as you go through the levels, each level has different options to be completed, you can buy stuff, talk to your opponent or just attack, this way you can find out more or less information about the Toolnich location. The story follows the 'player' who received an invitation from an old friend to an unknown location. In time you realize that your friends are there and you are slowly trying to discover the new location. Toolnich is an almost forgoten village with a very mysterious history, your mission in theory is to save the location and make it known to the public again, of course you don't have to respect that, the game has different endings. Everything happens in 2063, a future not very technologically advanced world that is similar to ours (same planet, geography, countries, languages and even a little history.)",
