Oh, and look good to your friends by smashing their scores on the leaderboards. Got It? Good. Let's Fucking Do This! Fast-paced gameplay that will make the bones in your hands shatter!!! Random order boss spawns featuring fun champions such as BIGBONES, GUTSHANK and PRIESTESS! Leaderboards to prove you're better than the rest of the world, or at least your friends!
