Kang sees a blue flower on her head and nobody else sees that flower. Sometimes, when she gets angry her eyes began shining. She loves gamble-games, and, most of all, she is mad about the game that was explained to her by some guest who was passing by that place. • Shan She is the leader of the werewolves and she is a cold white she-wolf. There are rumors about her people that spread among the humans. Most of the rumor is filled with fear but nobody knows anything for sure. • Kang His mother passed away when he was quite little. So he has vague memories about her. Kang used to play with Lin during the days of their childhood. When he was saved from the witch by a swordsman, Kang decided to be a warrior. However Kang was escorted to the capital because the Emperor was in rage so that the ruler could threaten to Kang’s father. He loves drinking. He often crosses the line drinking really too much.
