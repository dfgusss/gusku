    "About the game": "Available on Steam for the first time - and for FREE! About The Tribloos Originally released in 2011, The Tribloos was the first game in the series. The Tribloos is a casual time management game where the player needs to help the tiny Tribloos in rebuilding their villages. This is done by managing manpower (or tribpower?) as a resource. The more tribloos performing a task the faster it gets finished. Use collected resources such as wood and stone to build simple and complex structures to complete the objectives of each level. You don't need to complete everything in the time given - but you want those gold times, right? Features 75 Levels Original Sound Track Explore the first game in the series! Check out the two sequels, also on Steam! The Story Help Trey the Tribloo save Tribloo village from a destructive storm! Embark on a journey across the land in The Tribloos! Travel across Tribloo Island as you embark on a terrific journey with Trey and his friends as they search for help. Rebuild the villages of different Tribes and become the hero of the Tribloos in this incredible Strategy game.",
