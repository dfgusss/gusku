    "About the game": "After committing honorable seppuku Turtle finds himself in hell. Turtle is compelled in death to do what he loved most when he was alive: Race. But, he needs the minds of hell's other denizens to do so. As he explores their minds one question seems to permeate, 'Why would anyone choose hell over heaven?' The objective of this dialogue heavy philosophical platformer/runner is to reach a goal speed by avoiding and bouncing off of obstacles by using a grapple-based movement system. There are only three buttons, up, down, and pull/push. Small mistakes are fine as there is no restarting or death since it's your average recent speed that matters. Instead players should find themselves entering a zen-like flow as they attempt to achieve maximum velocity. Horrible graphics I know, but I promise the story is good and the gameplay is fun.",
