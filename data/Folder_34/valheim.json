Craft powerful weapons, construct longhouses, and slay mighty foes to prove yourself to Odin! EXPLORE THE TENTH WORLD Explore a world shrouded in mystery. Discover distinct environments with unique enemies to battle, resources to gather and secrets to uncover! Be a viking, sail the open seas in search of lands unknown, and fight bloodthirsty monsters. BUILD MIGHTY HALLS Raise viking longhouses and build bases that offer reprieve from the dangers ahead. Customise buildings, both inside and out, with a detailed building system. Progress through building tiers to upgrade, expand and defend your base. GATHER, CRAFT AND SURVIVE Struggle to survive as you gather materials and craft weapons, armor, tools, ships, and defenses. Decorate your hearths and sharpen your blades, grow crops and vegetables, prepare food, brew meads and potions, and progress as you defeat more difficult bosses and discover new recipes and blueprints. KEY FEATURES: Massive procedurally-generated world where every biome is immersive and distinct, with unique enemies, resources and crafting recipes to discover.

Staminabased combat that rewards preparation and skill. Utilize weapon types with unique attacks, different blocking styles, ranged combat, dodges and parries to fight your enemies.

Intuitive crafting where recipes are discovered as you explore the world, and pick up new resources and ingredients. Flexible building system that takes structural integrity and ventilation into account. Build a small shelter or an entire village, make outposts or claim abandoned buildings as your own.
