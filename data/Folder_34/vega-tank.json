    "About the game": "Remember the good old times you spent your days playing Tanks on the NES with your family? Remember all those times when they had won, they gloated and made fun of you? Well now is the time you pay them back! A classic Tanks gameplay, enriched by powerups, tank types, and more TANKTASTIC game modes. A single player game mode, where you have to stop Waldorf Lufka from conqering the world. Fully destructible environment will allow you to show off your tactical skills. Fight across over 100 levels across 4 different regions of the world. From dusty deserts and lush jungles to devastated cities. Play with your friends in the multiplayer mode for up to 4 players. Compete against them in classic deathmatch mode, or, if you're feeling more tactical, sneak your way into their base and capture their flag! Global and region-based leaderboards and rankings - compare your skills with others. Competetive matchmaking allows you to find people of similar experience and skill Soundtrack composed by Adam Skorupa, the composer of the universally acclaimed Witcher soundtrack.",
