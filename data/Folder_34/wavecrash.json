    "About the game": "Head-to-head puzzle brawling action! Match blocks to send waves at your opponent! Dodge their waves or crash them head-on to survive. Unleash unique super attacks and explosive Hype Mode to tip the scales. It's a back-and-forth struggle for arcade puzzling dominance! WaveCrash!! is a competitive puzzle brawler that combines elements of fighting games and puzzle games to create a new take on the party fighter genre. Players match up blocks into groups that they launch at their opponent in the form of waves. Hitting an opponent's wave causes the two waves to 'crash' and cancel out. Hitting your opponent pushes the dividing line forward, earning you more of the board and bringing you one step closer to victory. Featuring: 1 v 1 and 2 v 2 mode with customization options so you can 'Crash it your Wave'! Gameplay that is accessible enough for newcomers and deep enough for the hardcore competitors. Players of all skill levels can crash together! A roster of 10 characters with unique traits and special attacks, including an indestructible android, an infernally combusting tycoon, and the strongest mom in the universe! 5 stages with alternate 'Wavy' forms that apply their own twist on the game, like the shifting winds of the Forest Clearing and pet parade of Paw Plaza. Single player score attack modes to hone your skills for the real competition. Infinite blocks. They never stop...",
