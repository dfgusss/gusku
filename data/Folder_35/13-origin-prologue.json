    "About the game": "When you wake up in the mental institute you're in charge of, you realize you've been locked in your room by your most dangerous (and clever) patient. Will you be able to reach the way out while taking the journal you found in your room and stepping into an ancient story? / 13:Origin - Prologue is a kind of preview of our game called '13:Origin' , which we aim to release soon. With this prologue, you will be able to experience the storyline we aim for and some of our different, unique and satisfying puzzles. 13:Origin offers you more than just a mechanical puzzle-solving experience. You'll need to leverage the mechanics, the story, your instincts, and most importantly, 'doubt' to solve puzzles meticulously crafted for you. IMERSIVE AND ORGANIC STORY 13:Origin - Prologue offers you a unique story that you have not experienced before and the tense atmosphere created by that story. SECRETS TO DISCOVER As you solve these unique puzzles, you also uncover a secret that has been around since the beginning of mankind. MINIMALIST INTERFACE We do not want to confuse your mind even more, which is already sufficiently entangled with stories and puzzles. The interface and gameplay were thought as minimalist as possible.",
