You will follow her on her journey to collect the three Chromatic Orbs corresponding to the primary colors red, green and blue, in order to save her people. Achrome City Welcome to Mira's hometown, a large and bustling city in the middle of Hexa. Well, it used to be bustling, at least. When the color disappeared, so did the liveliness of the people.

Gryd A lush and thick forest full of trees, vines, a big lake, ancient ruins, a swamp, and a big temple. Find your way through challenging platforming sections, and try to solve an ancient light puzzle to open up a path towards your goal! Saving the world, one crystal at a time Mira has the unique ability to switch between her dimension and a similar but digital one. Discover how she starts to understand how to use this power to get to new places and collect more crystals.",
