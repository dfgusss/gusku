    "About the game": "Become a screen-filling bullet hell boss in Aperion Cyberstorm, a 2D fast based twin-stick shooter for 1-5 players! Find new Elements and Abilities, and mix them for more destructive power – Destroy areas full of enemies with plasma-coated spiral rockets, or turn an enemy to dust with electric mines, before finishing them with devastating lasers. In Campaign, travel across four planets, through over 200 unique areas, to find the team that abandoned you. Playable cooperatively for an added challenge as the enemies you fight become tougher. Versus is the true test of friendship. Don't lose your focus in the contained arenas, where the pools of lava aren’t the only threat. Ability/Element bundles drop into the match for instant power, and a chance to survive. Versus comes with eight fully customisable battle variants, for a quick scrap or a longer fight. Go it alone in Free-For-All, or buddy up with Team Battles and share the victory. Add AI players for true 5 player battles! Finally, are you brave enough to take on wave after devastating wave of enemies? In Onslaught, your enemies won’t stop until you're defeated so choose the right Ability set, as they are all that stand between your victory or destruction. Whether you use keyboard and mouse or controllers, Aperion Cyberstorm comes with different options to give you the best, accessible experience including toggle fire, southpaw, autofire, text resizing, and more! Each player can customise a local profile with their favourite name, colour ship, power-ups and control preference to jump into the action faster – perfect for parties! • Three game play modes (Campaign, Versus and Onslaught) that all support 1-5 players • AI Players in Versus mode for constant five player battles • 12 different ships - all with different power, defence, speed and recharge rate • 14 abilities and six elements to provide thousands of destructive combinations • Accessibility options for each player that include southpaw, automatic shooting and ability activation, and also global text resizing • Collect shards from fallen enemies in Campaign mode to upgrade abilities with new damaging effects • Play with any combination of controllers supported and can also use keyboard and mouse • Unlockable content within each mode",
