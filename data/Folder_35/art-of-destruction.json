    "About the game": "A physics sandbox simulation game for you to mess with. Build world you can imagine and destroy anything you create. You can throw asteroid into the building, crush it, set it on fire, or smash it with bomb explosions. Tornado, sand storm, black hole, tsunami, zombie apocalypse, nuclear explosion, and many many more! Explore open levels or you can build your world. You can import voxel models and create your cube world. Just came across an awesome resource that I wanted to share with everyone. Mike Judge created a GitHub project that contains a set of 400 free voxel models for creating artwork and games. You can check out the pack and the included license by following the link below: #mini-mikes-metro-minis Play, destroy, and have fun!",
