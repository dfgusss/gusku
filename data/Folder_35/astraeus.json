    "About the game": "Astraeus is a VR asteroid mining RTS game that's quick to play, easy to learn, and enormous in scope. Build a mining network from dozens of bases, and watch as hundreds of ships swarm around you in a dazzling web of light. In the near future, dozens of companies are operating in the asteroid belt, fighting for their share of the biggest gold rush in history. Your job is to control swarms of mining drones, build a network of bases, and outpace the competition. Or crush them. Astraeus was created as the winning entry in the Qualcomm VR Developer Challenge, an online reality show for VR development. It is the fourth VR strategy game from E McNeill, along with Darknet, Tactera, and Skylight.",
