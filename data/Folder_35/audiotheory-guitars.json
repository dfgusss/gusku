    "About the game": "AudioTheory Guitars is the ultimate reference tool for guitar notes and chords. Featuring a built-in keyboard, each note reacts to your input across the customisable chord and fretboard diagrams. For anyone who's ever wished music theory was that little bit more straightforward – this is the software for you. The full set of features: Seamlessly transcribe between piano and guitar using a straight-forward colour coding system and notation highlighting. Play a note on the keyboard, or directly from the chord and fretboard diagrams to see where it is across all formats. Set your tuning and capo . Everything else adjusts accordingly – no need for a chord transposition chart. Choose your chords with open, power, barre, sus2 and dim7 chord sheets with fullscreen diagrams and playback options. Exclude notes and never play out of key again. Your fretboard diagram now only shows the notes you need and your keyboard doesn't play the ones you don't. Scale presets you can quickly apply to the application. Save and load functions to easily swap between fully customised views. Midi support. Connect an external Midi input device to control the on-screen keyboard. Full customisation. Select the chords you want. Left-handed mode for left-handed players. Shifted tunings with an option to drop the 6th string, plus fullscreen fretboard mode with full string-level tuning. Choose between guitar and bass fretboard diagrams.",
