    "About the game": "What Is Babel: tower to the Gods? It's a charming physics based puzzle game designed around room-scale VR for the HTC Vive, which will test your coordination and wits, as you battle physics while working out how to de-construct part of a tower (to the gods) . You'll have to approach the towers from every angle walk, crouch, and even possibly jump, using a range of divine tools &amp; weaponry to carefully disassemble &amp; thoroughly check the stability of each unique and bizarre monument built before you, all while protecting the sacred totem, to ensure it's safety for it's worshippers! There's a variety of different types of puzzles in it, requiring a range of different skills - precision, logic, speed &amp; more! Examples: Precision - Using careful movements of your Vive controllers, slide a sword between blocks and push out blocks whilst narrowly avoiding the volatile and explosive bomb blocks , which will detonate with the slightest of your touch! Logic - Work out the correct order &amp; method of deconstruction! Knock out blocks simultaneously to keep the tower balance! Or, is there a large amount of blocks ontop of a slippery ice block ? Give it a fast &amp; hard whack from the side to sent it quickly sliding out of the tower without the blocks ontop falling off! Speed - Some towers may contain blocks that are being burnt away ! Once these blocks finish burning, they'll be reduced to ash &amp; disappear! Solve the tower fast enough that these burning blocks don't cause it to topple! We'll be adding more block types, features &amp; even new game-modes in the future! So an eye on those change logs to see what's new!",
