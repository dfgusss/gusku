    "About the game": "SUMMARY Bean Battles is a unique take on the popular genre of battle royales. It's similar to the starting zone of a normal battle royale, but you get multiple rounds, and kills are rewarded just as much as being the last alive. It's playable with 2-3 players, and can support up to 16. Team up, take revenge, and be the last bean standing. GAMEPLAY Most battle royale games consist of looting for 20 minutes all to die from someone you never saw. Bean Battles rounds only take a few minutes and put you right into the action. Guns/equipment are plentiful and there are vehicles scattered throughout the map to get you around. The zone will close after only 60 seconds so loot fast and head for the safe zone! If you die to an unlucky play you can spectate the rest of the round while you plan your revenge. CUSTOMIZATION In Bean Battles, you decide the rules. You choose the guns and equipment to your liking. Pick how many players are in your server and how many rounds you play. Choose from dozens of unlock-able cosmetic items.",
