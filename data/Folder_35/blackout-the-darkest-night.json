    "About the game": "You have been part of something terrible, something so unspeakable that caused you to blackout and forget all recent events. Now you have the choice of pursuing this dark truth or trying to bury it in the past. Maybe it’s not too late to turn back now. -- Blackout is a non-linear interactive fiction game set in a dark modern universe, influenced by White Wolf’s World of Darkness , H.P. Lovecraft and weird shows like Twin Peaks . In Blackout , you have 3 attributes that will change during the game: Courage, Sanity and Fitness . These attributes will also lock or unlock choices or paths, as will some items you may acquire along the way. Blackout is a game about hidden monsters and hidden fears, and ultimately about overcoming the worst adversary: one’s true self . You play as a man who finds himself lost in a dark street somewhere in the city of New Wenders. It doesn’t take long before you start having flashbacks and regaining your memory. Something terrible happened, and you were part of it. This event somehow opened your eyes to a whole new world that has been hiding beneath the shadows. As the player, you have the choice to dig deeper into this unspeakable deed or try to leave it all behind. Blackout is a game about choices , every chapter of the game takes place in a different location, and the order in which the chapters take place will change based on your choices. Even more so, the path you take inside each chapter varies greatly, and the effect of your choices could ripple across all chapters, meaning you could have a very different experience on a new playthrough.

There is also an Epilogue, so in total there are 11 chapters. -=Will I be able to visit all locations in one playthrough?=- No. Some locations are optional, and some are mutually exclusive. That said, some locations are obligatory so you will always see the main part of the story on a playthrough.",
