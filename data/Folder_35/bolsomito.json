    "About the game": "ABOUT THE GAME Bolsomito is indie, pixel art, Beat’em Up game and tells the story of a man who is tired of living in a society corrupted by an ideological enemy that intends to perpetuate itself in power through a communist revolution.  PLOT The game is inspired by the current Brazilian political climate and has as a protagonist a good willing citizen who has had enough of the growing corruption and inversion of values that plages his society. His primary objective is to get rid of the leaders of the Red Army, which are responsible for alienating and indoctrinating a large part of the nation in order to convince them to defend and fight for their horrendous causes. Nevertheless, to reach the heads of the organization, Bolsomito will have to face many different groups whose mission once was to protect the people, but now are nothing more than puppets controlled by the Red Army.   GAMEPLAY Unlike the great classic beat’em ups, Bolsomito will be an all out brawl with lots of satire and unique mechanics that make the game a one of a kind. DESIGN Developed with pixel art, Bolsomito will present lots of unique Brazilian scenery and a plethora of vehicles and national references that go from opponents to sympathizers of the anti-communist struggle.",
