WORLDMAP Worldmap include 3 themed zones and 20 levels: - Enchanted Forest - Deadly Desert - Misty Mountains WAR CUBES There are 8 unit types in total. Each cube have special abilities and is strong or weak against one or more other unit types The Legionaries are basic cubes. Their strength is in their numbers. Barbarians are fast and brutal units with enough health to counter almost any other cube as long as it is not armored. Knights are the backbone of every army. They fight with great success against all others except Mages. Archers...Killing two of them is ridiculously easy, but you don't want to stand up against twenty. With their huge shields and long spears those cube soldiers are also called 'Monster killers'. They fight with magic.Their fireballs will push back the screaming enemies back in their pits. Bombardiers are slow - they shoot slow, they move slow...but they will bring hell to all those who oppose them. One thing you should know about those non-cube units: you will need most of the above cubes in great numbers, only to bring down one of those...spiked balls.",
