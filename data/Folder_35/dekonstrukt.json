    "About the game": "DEKONSTRUKT is an interactive movie, with elements of first-person gameplay. You will be immersed in the inglorious story of a game developer with plenty of destructive black humor. The game responds to never-before-seen creative challenges. Help the protagonist deal with his inner demons. Or not really. As you can see, the game tries with all its might to seem like it's not just another triviality. In other words, my mother grew a vegetable, even though she is not a gardener. ✔ A story that will stay in your memory for a long time. ✔ Unexpected plot twists and turns. ✔ Black humor ✔ Depressing atmosphere ✔ Notes that reveal the story (you need to be able to read) The basket of Russian deep thought has turned upside down.",
