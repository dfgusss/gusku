    "About the game": "Dragon Forge is an incremental base-building adventure game about managing massive amounts of resources by foraging and crafting. Born a dragon in a cursed land, you must work to lift the curse by creating abundance. BECOME AN EXTREMELY POWERFUL DRAGON You’re born a dragon that has much to learn but destined to be as powerful as the ancients. You’ll learn to attack, jump, fly, swim, and breathe fire, poison and lightning. As you gain experience you will level up and become completely unstoppable. BUILD A GREAT CITY AND CRAFT UPGRADES, EQUIPMENT, AND MAGICAL GEMS Gather resources like wood, stone, iron and coal wherever you go. Use them to build an expansive city that is constantly automated by your swarm of very talented Goblin Minions. Then upgrade your city buildings to produce more and better resources at truly enormous scales. You’ll also discover and cook over 30 unique food recipes to maintain your energy level and unlock a variety of nice bonuses to take advantage of. EXPLORE A BEAUTIFUL SPRAWLING WORLD OF CURSED LANDS An entire world is waiting to be unlocked. Every area is cursed and you must gain mana to unlock them as you explore. You’ll discover over 80 wild areas and several big biomes each with their own unique resources, epic enemies, tricky puzzles, intriguing quests, satisfying rewards, interesting characters, and wonderful hidden treasures. There’s always something more to be admired and explored. LEARN FROM THE DRAGON FORGE Over 100 wonderful fables of ancient wisdom can be learned. Written over 2,500 years ago and passed down from generation to generation, these righteous fables teach a variety of elite virtues and ethics. Included with each fable are phenomenal 200-year-old woodcut illustrations to inspire your imagination and strengthen your moral compass.
