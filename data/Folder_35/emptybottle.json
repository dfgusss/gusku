    "About the game": "Empty Bottle is a 2D single-player story-driven adventure. In an odd container world, a bottle saves a cup from the evil Formula then start their journey together. Life`s but an empty bottle, a silent container, that wonders and accepts, colored by strangers. In a world that everybody is nothing but a bad temper jar or a broken cup or an orphan barrel, you, as a normal bottle, and used to be a dry-dead one, is trying to make some sense of your life. You can communicate with others by words, or more “professionally” and emotionally, by exchanging fluid with others. And their response is not always positive. Don`t be afraid. You will meet your destiny, and a girl. From certain perspective, they are the same thing. Do the Right Thing. Sometimes it`s flirting with a bottle of perfume, sometimes you must pretend to be a pot. Or just open a regular lock with a regular key. Pouring into others to get extra information. But don`t overdo it. An empty bottle is nothing but a dead one.",
