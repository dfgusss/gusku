    "About the game": "This war, against machine, we know we are losing. They are much more powerful, can make much better choices than we do, more important， they have much more quantity. So, we had to make a tough decision: use machine to against machine To have more power, I machined my right arm; to capture the least motion of enemy, I machined my right eye; to make the fastest, best solution to against machine, I machined my left brain; to keep all machine in my body run long enough, I even machined left half of my heart . To survive, half of me machined to a robot. But as the war went on, I realize what I give to machine, not only my body at all… Points you may interested about The varied topography, and beautiful scenery We use pure hand-painted to design the whole game to avoid inflexible movement of character designed by DragonBones; Each weapon has its own normal attack movement，and its own charge attack Each monster has its own attack If you run into a store and find out there is not even a penny in your pocket，what would you do? In real life, it gonna be running away. But in this game… More important, what you choose to do in the game will change the game in several ways, even the endings, but it requires players find out themselves. In the future There still lots of idea about this game we didn’t add to this game. More rooms, more games , more diffcult levels; Unique power to each weapon will be added, such as use your hammel weapon in specified situation will change or update your other weapon or use Meteor hammer to pull over your enemies; The units you choose in game will cause resonance and update at the same time, but it will cause some trouble also. The number of weapon will increased to at least 20, more weapon more fun, and we definitely will add some intersting type of weapon, too The amount of units you can get in game will increased 3 or 4 times. The game level will rise to 6 and the number of BOSS will increase to at least 6 also(without DLC, if we had one after) Game Difficultise of game will be 4, and we will change the game mechanism at high difficulty level. We came out lots of interesting ideas of this game everyday and delete those parts make people bored, and what we trying to do is provide a interesting game to every player.",
