Infommi focuses heavily on boss battles and skill/experience with characters. Each character consists of: - A movement ability - Two normal abilities - An ultimate ability - A positive passive ability - A negative passive ability - A Primary Weapon - A Secondary Weapon - Bad Puns Infommi has a special perma-upgrade system called Teeth Upgrades. There are 3 categories of Teeth Upgrades: - Character Specific Upgrades - Global Offensive Upgrades - Global Defensive Upgrades Each character has 2 Character specific upgrades that completely change their playstyle by tweaking their abilities and stats. Now, how about we talk on how the game works? You start off in the middle of a parking lot overrun by IRCOMMI , the game's enemies. Your mission is to eliminate all ISOMMI , the game's bosses, which are located in separate rooms at each side of the map. However, you cannot let IRCOMMI run rampant, so you must eliminate a certain amount of IRCOMMI in order to proceed to ISOMMI . Each boss room has 3 ISOMMI which are chosen randomly upon the boss room's entrance. At the end of each boss fight, you have a guaranteed Teeth drop and A health pack. Now, stop reading and start playing!",
