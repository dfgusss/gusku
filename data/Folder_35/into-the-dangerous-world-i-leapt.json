    "About the game": "You know him: he is near you: point him out: Shall I see glories beaming from his brow? Or trace his footsteps by the rising flowers? The year is 1801 and the industrial revolution is in full swing. Cotton mills are being built all over England, with children providing the cheap workforce. You play as Idony, a small girl who just started working at one of these factories alongside her brother, Edus. One day you wake up and Edus is gone. Into the Dangerous World I Leapt is a surreal first person puzzle game inspired by the works of William Blake. In it, you travel between two worlds, just like flipping a coin. 1-2 hours of explorative gameplay. Travel between two worlds and discover the secrets of The Factory. Talk to angels, faces, and your fellow workers. Solve puzzles and help the denizens of both worlds. Pay the meat toll to enter the meat hall. Stay away from The Beast.
