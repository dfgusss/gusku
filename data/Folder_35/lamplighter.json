    "About the game": "It’s 1807 and you are a lamplighter, responsible for keeping the street lights of London lit. Lamplighter is a story-driven puzzle game, set amidst the magical early 1800s when gas street lamps began to turn night into day and provoke people's imaginations, hopes, and fears. Key Features: Unique puzzle mechanic involves creating regions of light and darkness on a grid, where same-colored regions cannot touch. Solve logic puzzles to keep the streets of London lit. Interact with characters along your lamplighting route. As the wielder of a strange and new technology, you have the power to affect people's opinions. Make choices that affect the story's outcome: Will London accept progress or will fear prevail? You'll decide through your dialogue choices and puzzle-solving skills.",
