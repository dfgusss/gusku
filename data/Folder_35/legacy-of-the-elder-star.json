    "About the game": "Legacy of the Elder Star is a mouse-driven shoot 'em up for the rest of us. You are the Cosmonaut, an eternal cosmic hero who must shatter the robotic Infinite Legion and rekindle a dying star! “Legacy of the Elder Star knocks it out of the park, retaining the retro charm of the genre without shackling itself to the past.” — GamerPros Using a one-handed, mouse-driven control scheme, you'll dodge and strike with 1:1 precision and unlimited movement speed . Evade intense bullet patterns in the blink of an eye, then dash through entire enemy squads to crush them in a single gesture. Movement is everything in Legacy of the Elder Star , and no other shoot 'em up moves like this . “Instantly feels familiar and intuitive.” — TechRaptor Legacy of the Elder Star is focused on playing smart offense, not picking your way through overwhelming bullet hell. Enemy patterns change each time you play , keeping you on your toes and avoiding rote sequence repetition; daily challenges are even further randomized. Extensive accessibility options like a colorblind mode, auto-fire toggle, and adjustable game speed are included for gamers with disabilities, or even just those who want a more laid-back experience. “An absolute joy to look at, as well as play.” — Gamers Haven",
