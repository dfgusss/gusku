Boss Intro 'You can hear this monster tumbling miles away, with each step thrusting fear into your heart. Some soldiers even pissed their pants before it actually showed up. I was lucky, losing my consciousness when buried under ruins brought by the monster's attacks. When I woke up, my comrades were gone, and my sight was filled with nothing but blue, sparkling dust.' -- Sergeant Alex -- Federal Military Court 'V_log 2321-9-11: This is Doctor Miles on the expedition to reveal the mystery of these huge tunnels found around the planet surface.

Back in the day I was a still a star explorer (loud laughter from around), I went on a scout mission to Colony C-080. Yeah, there used to be a colony before a gigantic explosion. Guess what I saw there? A robotic rat thing larger than Qomolangma was gnawing its fella (loud laughter again). It looked at me as if my ship was a f**king mosquito. Soon after I came back I submitted a report and quit the star explorers. You never know what kind of horror is hiding out there, kids.' -- A drunker in a bar on Primal Earth -- Former ace pilot of the star explorers Codename 'DustDragon' - Confirmed Encounters : 0 Codename 'Octo' - Confirmed Encounters : 0 Codename 'MuTRax' - Confirmed Encounters : 0",
