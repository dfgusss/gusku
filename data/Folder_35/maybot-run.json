Quotes from some Reviewers, Youtubers, &amp; Maybot Run Players: “ On its surface it’s political commentary is blatant and hilariously so, but there’s a surprising amount of depth to its cuts. ” – Astrid Johnson, Indie Haven “ The gameplay is extremely original for an endless runner. The soundtrack is pretty righteous as well. ” – Dayton Does Gaming “ A tongue in check game that you can get a good laugh at ” – Rip Cassidy “ The funniest game I’ve played since Plug and Play ” – Mooshi Gamer “ Maybot Run has an awesome soundtrack ” – Tesla ゴジラ Gaming The Story In 2016 Maybot landed in the UK and quickly took power as an unelected dictator. Help her and her cronies run, jump, slide, and shoot their way to a stronger, and more stable leadership. Wreak havoc on the poor, help the elite, and be as naughty as possible in those wheat fields. With your help Maybot can defeat the coalition of chaos; morality and hope, bringing back the wealth to the elite few and condemning the many to ordinary working poverty. There are girl's jobs and boy's jobs but this is definitely a bot's job. This game is based on true events that may or may not have happened by people who may or may not be real. #MaybotRun",
