    "About the game": "This game exercises your memory. It comes with a Shapes theme and a Fruits theme (collections of images) There are additional Down Loadable Content themes available and many more coming (all very inexpensive) The game has 3 button selectable difficulty levels (easy, medium, triplets). There are rows of images, 8 images per row (so 3 rows for easy yields 3*8=24 image locations), but the images are 'covered' when play begins Every play is different, the hidden image locations are randomly generated each time The player clicks a pair of covered images to uncover them and see if they match. If they do not, they are covered again. The player clicks a different pair to see what they are, and eventually discovers an image that matches a previous image Now knowing the locations of a pair of matching images, the player clicks them and they stay uncovered. The player repeats this process, remembering the location of new images, until all pairs are matched and uncovered The game shows the players time, as well as the previous best time for that difficulty level When players win and gain confidence, they can change the game to medium (6 rows yields 6*8=48 image locations) When players become very confident, they can change to triplets of matching images (6 rows yields 6*8=48 image locations) Since the score is based on fast times, it works best using a mouse to easily click squares. you can also just relax and click, playing for fun and ignoring time it is suitable for everyone, from children to seniors. Truly Family-Friendly The initial base-game has a Shapes and a Fruits themes, but we have several up-coming downloads (all inexpensive) with other themes.",
