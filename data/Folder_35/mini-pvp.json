    "About the game": "mini PVP : Multiplayer mini arena battles. Chaotic, frantic, casual. The game features a frantic free-for-all 1 v 1 v 1 v 1 combat. Just pick a character, and frag your opponents in a tiny map for the next 2 minutes! Take granular control of your adrenaline rush IRL: Play 2 matches, 22 matches or 222 matches. It's all up to you! 4 player FFA 2 minutes long matches 3 characters, each with a distinctive skill 7 weapons Super easy to pickup, even easier to master! Private Matches (friendship destroyer) --Geeky stuff below-- mini PVP is designed to provide a 'shot' of instant joy, with minimal 'meta tracking' demanded from the player. The gameplay loop only adds two dramatic changes to the 'core' competitive shooter experience: Staying alive is as important as fragging rivals. Different characters with mildly different stats and marginally different skills with relatively quick cooldowns. Staying alive is as important as fragging your rivals? Here's why: Your score increases with each rival you frag, but it also decreases every time you get fragged. Sounds harsh, right? Don't worry. Multiple consecutive frags worth more points! The characters in mini PVP all have different stats and skills, thus each are suitable for one of three play-styles: Balanced, Defensive, Aggressive. Ranger is a balanced character with average health and movement speed. Skill: BOOM! Throws 3 grenades at once! Grenades have a huge explosion radius. Useful for crowd/map control. Duff is a defensive character with massive health at the expense of a lower movement speed. Skill: SHIELD. Activates a damage absorbing shield that grants temporary invulnerability and minor health regeneration per bullet absorbed. Shade is a character with an aggressive play-style. She is the fastest character, but she has the lowest health. Skill: SLICE. Dash with high melee damage. Can be utilized both for close encounters and evasive maneuvers. Defies gravity. Increases movement speed. That's all the meta! The rest is just... Fun!",
