    "About the game": "A tower woven of memory holds the book of doubts. It invalidates the structure from within. My angel went before me. She saw outer paradise and returned to me. Now I must find the book that grins. Explore the remains of the tower Babil and encounter the terrible images left behind by those driven into madness. Rescue the artisan relics that reflect the old world and give you power as you explore the new. Arm yourself with weapons, items and the experiences from the past to overcome the evil within. Are you brave enough to follow your Angel to the top of the tower? Key Features Tons of semi-random floors to explore. Layouts can be learnt but item and exit locations will change. A huge cast of enemies organised into varying encounter groups. A collection of different weapons and a bunch of items to find and utilise. Tons of Relics to discover. Each granting bonuses for future attempts. Level up with Offering experience after each attempt. Unlock extra challenging modes once you complete your first run.",
