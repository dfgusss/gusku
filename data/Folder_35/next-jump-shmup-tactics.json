    "About the game": "NEXT JUMP is a love letter to shmup's [Shoot 'em up or space shooters], read in a slightly different manner: In turn-based battles! Your mission, our mission, is simple: The dragons are fleeing with all our Elixir supply. Stop them! It's a Tactics SHMUP : Take your time and plan your moves! A excellent Coffee break game : Turn-based with fast gameplay. No long waiting time, these turns go by fast! Not only inspired by classic Shmups and Bullet Hells, it’s also influenced by tactical games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Jeanne d’Arc and Roguelikes like FTL and Crypt of the NecroDancer. Each Sector is a Board! Each given “JUMP” represents a new combat board procedurally generated , simulating combat situations only seen in SHMUPs! Pick from 7 playable Ships , all inspired by classic weapons: Ballista, Dagger, Hammer, Staff, Sword, Shield and a Secret one! Equip and Upgrade your ship with different weapons and accessories that change the combat dynamics! Your mission: JUMP ! Chase the Dragons and stop them from running away with all that is most sacred to the Bastards by jumping from sector to sector, facing hordes of enemies in turn-based battles! Be a pilot of the Bastards Federation: A group formed by Elves, Humans, Dwarves and Orcs who used to live in peace, sharing their love for all Beverages. Like the classic games of the past, it has a complete MANUAL , accessible within the game!",
