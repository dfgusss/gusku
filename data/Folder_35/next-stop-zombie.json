Aliens that had been living underground since WWII have completed an intergalactic portal made of X-Points. If not stopped, all humans will be reduced to zombies. You hold the key to foil this invasion and save all humans! The game has a dungeon-type map. You have between 6 and 12 red X-point gems that you need to find and remove from flame throwing aliens and custodians. Sometimes you need to find keys to unlock automatic doors. Keys can be in the form of switches, regular keys or shooting posts. Be careful with zombies, aliens and alien-created spiders and robots! X-point gems appear as small red flares or dots in bird-view map, Survival kits are yellow dots, Ammo kits appear as green dots, Avatar assistant is a purple dot, Player position is a blue dot. Note: press Esc key or Pause button to get to the exit/save menu",
