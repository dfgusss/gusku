    "About the game": "They say something has been awoken in the old woods... Obscura is a atmospheric horror experience that immerses you in an endless circle of fear. Face a relentless and almost invisible entity. Keep eyes and ears on the creepy environment with several tools at your disposal. Use them to prepare your mind for what's to come. Look, listen and pray it doesn't enter your reality. This puristic horror shocker does not rely on movement or violence and is made to be experienced multiple times, with fully randomized and unpredictable events. Come back if you dare and you may see something new. But beware, each visit will draw you more and more into the dark... Features Anxiety, tension, spine chilling scares and a cryptic lore to uncover. Randomized, puristic experience without objectives, but quite a few secrets. High quality production value and comfort, suited for all users. If you are looking for the ultimate shocker for your next VR-Party, you are right here. Comfort and Technical Movement: No movement, stationary, room-scale. Anti-Aliasing: MSAA and TAA. Super-Sampling: Via in-app setting. Oculus Rift Tracking: 180° and 360° supported.",
