    "About the game": "Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru - The game requires you not to allow evil spirits to get to you. Kill him quickly and ruthlessly. Is a game in which you need to press the corresponding buttons on the keyboard (arrows) at a certain moment to damage the enemy! If the enemy has reached you, then you have a little more time until the enemy has dealt you four blows with the sword. When the enemy has health at 0%, then our protagonist will say 'Omae Wa Mou Shindeiru', this means 'You're already dead' and after that our opponent asks 'NANI ???', this translates to ' What???'. After these two replicas, our main character begins to shine very brightly and after that the enemy's head explodes into small pieces. Key features: - Good graphics design - Unusual death of the enemy - 8 levels (each level is harder and harder) - 13 achievements. - Suitable for achievement hunters.",
