    "About the game": "Physical Glitch - this is a casual game where you control a black circle. Your task is to collect pink squares that appear on the screen in a random place. The difficulty of the game lies in the fact that red objects appear on the screen, from contact with which the circle breaks and you have to start the game again. The game is actively using physics, so keep this in mind when you need to dodge a red object attack. And how many pink squares can you collect? Features: - Use of physics - Interesting gameplay - Relaxing graphics - Pleasant music",
