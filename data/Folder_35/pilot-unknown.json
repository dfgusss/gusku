Each floor contains a combination of combat, shop, puzzle, quest, and boss rooms. Randomized Item Drops : With over 150 items to discover, the player can customize their ship however they like. Every level contains a random distribution of firearms, power-ups, and robotic allies. Synergies are waiting to be built. Permanent Death : There is no mercy for those who crash-land. Death in the dungeon means restarting the first floor with no items.
