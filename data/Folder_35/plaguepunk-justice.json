    "About the game": "This world has been dominated by the Plague for many generations. Nobody remembers what it was like before the outbreak. Yet the humanity has adapted to the world of eternal disease. To zombies. To masks. To plague doctors. Plaguepunk Justice is a tactical turn-based strategy game about being a healer in a world of Plague. The Plague is turning regular citizens into zombies. As a player you have only non-lethal options to deal with any situation. Main characters are healers, not murderers. Features Turn-based tactical gameplay Stealth elements Randomized game levels Medicine crafting Plaguepunk world Comic book aesthetic Developers message Plaguepunk Justice is my second game and my first try at randomly generated game levels. As with my previous game - Comrades and Barons: Solitaire of Bloody 1919 - it is made with GameMaker: Studio 1.4.",
