    "About the game": "The world is ending. But it's not as scary as you think. Well, maybe it is. We all make choices in life. Except most of those choices are not within the context of the apocalypse. Meet the staff of the Department of Pre-Apocalypse and Post-Apocalyptic Affairs: Arthur, Iris, Oliver, two of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and others. Their job is to make sure the transition from one way of life to another is as smooth as possible... you know, as smooth as an apocalypse can be. Their latest assignment is a doozy - a new Great Flood that is going to wipe the planet clean. A daunting task for anyone, and these anyones just happen to have a metric boatload of emotional baggage. Will they get their collective stuff together in time to pull of a perfect end-of-the-world? That's up to you. You get to make the decisions that will shape our heroes. You get to choose how they will react to the moments that will stay with them forever. Taking each of their lives into your hands, you get to make their choices for them, for better or for worse. It's part adventure game, part visual novel. How will you end the world? Features Take control of every main character as you choose how they respond to situations. 8 different categories in which to shape the story.",
