    "About the game": "POP: Methodology Experiment One is an experimental game by Rob Lach which dissects the impact of reinterpreting the typical game development process and following a self-prescribed dogma to its creative conclusion. POP takes you on a visual and emotional roller-coaster, throwing at you a series of disjointed interactive vignettes of ranging purpose, visual style, and frustration. Deluxe Edition Includes Game of the Saeculum Edition DLC Official Soundtrack Game of the Saeculum Edition Includes Developer Commentary where Rob Lach whispers secrets into your ear and desperately tries to fit a commentary 3x as long as the actual game Game Mode Switches Including modes like 66.6 which allows you to play the game at 66.6% speed and Huetrip making everything continuously shift colors. Methodology Experiment #1 POP:ME1 was designed music first, with the game mechanics, visual aesthetic, and overall structure derived from the creative flow of the music production process. As Rob created each song, he imagined a game that would go along with it, tapping into the emotional energy of the music he was creating, documenting his concepts, and executing the ideas with minimal iteration. What emerged is a series of interactive vignettes, disjointed, taking the player on an intimidatingly intense and equally indecipherable journey of frustration and wonder.",
