    "About the game": "Real Scary is a 'stop motion animation' psychological horror simulation featuring over 1000 real life photos. You will be tasked with moving throughout your house to find clues as to why evil spirits are torturing your mind. Eventually these spirits will shift from harassing you to outright attempting to murder you, so be prepared to run for a hiding spot or respond to quick time events at any moment. You will be chased, terrorized and left in constant suspense until the very end. If you manage to finish the game within a certain time frame you will be treated to a secret ending... but only the very best Real Scary players will be able to discover it.",
