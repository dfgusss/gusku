    "About the game": "Ring of Fire is a detective noir puzzler set in the solarpunk utopia of New London. You play as Detective Grosvenor, a jaded, middle-aged woman hunting through the still-dark corners of the city in pursuit of a radicalised serial killer. Using your powers of deduction you must solve the brutally gruesome murders of the Ring of Fire killer. Examine clues, interrogate key suspects, and cross-reference your findings in the police database to uncover the mystery. SEARCH Solve the case using text entry, meaning you can’t brute force the puzzle. INTERVIEW Push your suspects to the brink through branching cinematic conversations with meaningful consequences. INVESTIGATE Explore the 3D crime scene to examine evidence both visually and textually.",
