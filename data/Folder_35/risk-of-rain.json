    "About the game": "Risk of Rain is an action platformer with roguelike elements . With permanent death as a primary feature, players will have to play their best to get as far as possible. Fight on a mysterious planet with randomly spawning enemies and bosses , either alone or with 3 friends in online co-op . With over 100 items at your disposal, you will find the tools you need to find the teleporter back home. Discover a myriad of randomly chosen stages , from the desolate forest to the frozen tundra. The three main goals for our game are simple: 1. Design a game that is randomly generated every play-through, to keep replayability high and fresh. 2. Time = difficulty. The higher the in-game time gets, the harder the difficulty gets. Keeping a sense of urgency keeps the game exciting! 3. Be enjoyable, regardless of whether you win or lose. No more fussing with complex and non-intuitive gameplay patterns. Players should not blame the game for their loss! ''..joy comes from amassing items, gaining experience and watching your character evolve into a godly killing machine.'' - Joystiq ''This game is immaculate.
