    "About the game": "INTRODUCTION ROGUE SHIFT is a high-intensity top-down shooter with rogue-lite elements and character progression, set on a harsh planet that will test your will to survive. To stay alive, you will pit yourself against hordes of relentless enemies in an unforgiving, hostile environment. Level up, unlock perks, gain psionic abilities and find weapons to become progressively more powerful as you attempt to stay one step ahead of the enemy. ROGUE SHIFT can be played using a keyboard &amp; mouse, or as a twin-stick shooter using any compatible controller (XBox, PlayStation or generic equivalents). STORY When your dropship is shot down by supposedly friendly defences, you find yourself isolated. Your oxygen is running low, dangerous creatures lurk, and hazardous environments separate you from the nearest outpost. Before you can even think about finding answers, your immediate concern is just to survive the first five minutes. FEATURE SUMMARY Survive insanely intense battles against relentless enemy hordes. Explore, loot and shop to build up your arsenal of psionics (powers) and weapons. Level up and unlock perks to boost your character over time in a manner that suits your play-style. Three distinct gameplay modes, all with online scoreboards. Some modes include online co-op up to 4 players. GAMEPLAY MODES STORY : A single-player story mode with rogue-lite elements and character progression, spanning 3 chapters. Advance through increasingly harder zones as you build up your arsenal of weapons and psionics to stay one step ahead of the enemy. You have one life. If you die, you must restart the chapter from the beginning. Complete a chapter without dying to unlock the next chapter. Gain XP and level up to unlock perks. You don't lose your perks when you die. Gain a slight edge with each run. DOOMED : Survive against progressively harder waves of enemies for as long as you can. Start with a standard base character with fast progression. Unlock one perk for each enemy wave you survive. Use shops and search for loot to rapidly build up your arsenal of weapons and psionics. ESCAPE : Battle your way through waves of enemies to reach the exit. Start with a standard base character with fast progression. Unlock one perk for each area you clear before you move on to the next area. Use shops and search for loot to rapidly build up your arsenal of weapons and psionics.",
