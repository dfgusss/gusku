It's a game about mastering different monster behaviors and using them creatively in combat. You will dive deep into different types of procedurally-generated dungeons, each with its unique difficulty, size and creatures. Death in each one means starting over from the very beginning of the dungeon, with no upgrades nor monsters in your loadout. But with death comes understanding and hidden knowledge of the dungeons' secrets. As you master each unique creature, you will be able to optimize your strategy by exploiting their weaknesses when fighting against them, and leveraging their strengths when summoning them. Every creature you defeat can be added to your loadout, from a half-witted spider to the great Morthgaal. Explore different types of procedurally generated dungeons, each with its unique theme, difficulty and monsters Summon every creature you encounter, from spineless minions to mighty bosses Master and combine different behaviors creatively Create and Execute your strategy in a turn-based, table-top combat system Cast your own combos with different monsters, magic potions and rune spells Upgrade your skills as you level up and go deeper into the dungeons Become the Rogue Summoner - no matter how many deaths it takes",
