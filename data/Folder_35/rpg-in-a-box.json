    "About the game": "Interested in following the development of RPG in a Box? Have a question, suggestion, bug to report, or would just like to say hello? Click the banner above to join the official Discord server and be a part of the growing community! RPG in a Box lets you easily turn your stories and ideas into games and other interactive experiences! As its name suggests, it contains everything necessary for doing so, all packaged together 'in a box'. The software is designed with a fun, beginner-friendly approach in mind as to not require any programming or modelling knowledge, while still providing a wide range of customization and openness. You can export your game to a standalone format for Windows, Linux, and MacOS, allowing others to play it without needing to own RPG in a Box! While RPG in a Box is constantly being expanded with new features and functionality, you can refer to the list below for a general, high-level look at what's currently possible in the engine. Voxel Editor Build tiles, objects, and characters from 3D pixel blocks (i.e. voxels) and easily animate them with the editor's frame-based, stop-motion animation system. Importing from MagicaVoxel (.vox) and Qubicle (.qb) is also supported. Map Editor Create grid-based worlds with the tiles you've built, then bring them to life by adding interactive NPCs and objects using the editor's intuitive navigation and interaction system. Scripting Set up and trigger in-game events with the visual, node-based script editor. Simply drag and drop the desired actions (no programming knowledge required), or manually code 'quick scripts' using Bauxite, the custom, Lua-like scripting language. Dialogue Write conversations for your NPCs using a visual, flowchart approach similar to that of the script editor. Branching dialogue is supported via player choices and condition checking. Camera System Choose from three available camera presets (standard, isometric, and first-person) or tweak the settings to create a custom camera. Stage dynamic cutscenes for your game using the engine’s flexible camera scripting system. Combat Systems Choose from tactical turn-based, real-time, or menu-driven turn-based combat, with more options and customization to come in future updates. UI Editor Design themes and customize the appearance of many other interface elements such as the inventory, main menu, and credits roll. The powerful widget system allows you to easily create unique mechanics for your game. Item Editor Define items for the player to find in containers or earn through the completion of tasks. Attach scripts to trigger effects for potions and other consumable items. Sound FX Generator Generate fun, retro-style sound effects using the built-in tool based on Dr. Petter’s SFXR.",
