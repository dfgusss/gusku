    "About the game": "RUNNER RTX is a classic runner game with a procedurally generated world but with cinematic graphics. In this game, you have to run through an abandoned enterprise that is about to explode. The building is in a rather deplorable state, which, of course, is rather bad, but it’s much more fun to play this way, because what’s the interest in running around a deserted room where nothing can fall on your head and you won’t be able to twist your leg anywhere? In order to more strongly feel the role of the protagonist, the game is implemented in high-end graphics, and fire particles are barely distinguishable from a blazing PC in real life! In general, there is no more time to explain. It's time to run and save your life from the fate of being fried to a crisp!",
