Surviving in the middle of the food chain you will be both predator and prey so be on your guard, feed your family and enjoy precious moments of peace and tranquillity when you can! About Shelter 2 : Starting as a pregnant mother your lynx begins her adventure by giving birth, then it's up to you to continue her journey into parenthood. Nurturing cubs is paramount and of course your survival is the only thing that will guarantee theirs! Shelter 2 includes more elaborate gameplay features than its predecessor including stamina, different types of movements, jumps and a variety of prey to kill all in the setting of the beautiful changing seasons. Besides hunting there are several maternal and hunting features, such as calling the cubs closer, sniffing out prey, drinking water from rivers and lifting and carrying your cubs from harm’s way. A vast wilderness awaits Environments in Shelter 2 are much bigger than its predecessor and allow a lot more freedom than ever before, allowing players to find favorite spots to return to. This time, weather and seasons change, harsh winters and bloomy summers await you! The music is once again scored by Retro Family, awarded for their work on the Pid Soundtrack, and the visuals have been reinvented by adding dense atmosphere and lighting to the patterned graphical art style.",
