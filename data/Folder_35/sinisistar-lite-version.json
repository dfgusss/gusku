    "About the game": "This is a simple 2D action game featuring Rabiane, a Sister sent by the Church to exorcise monsters in a cursed land. The game is centered on themes of masochistic tendencies, yearning for death, as well as despair at being attacked by terrifying beings. *This is the 'light version' of SiNiStar, a game released on DLsite in 2019. [Protagonist] Rabiane C.V.: Haru Amachi A member of the Church sent to Kessaria, an abandoned city overrun by monsters. With an abandoned cathedral as her base of operations, she takes on these monsters alone. Big-breasted. [Simple Actions] You may choose between a swift but close-ranged short sword and a bow with limited ammo but will allow you to aim and shoot from far. Use them wisely to clear the stages. [Various Monsters and Situations] About 40 different kinds of monsters attack Rabiane. If she runs out of energy, she will meet with various 'ends.' [Stages] Be it the thick forests or deep sewerage, the stifling dark pixel art of each stage elicits a feeling of despair. A total of six stages are available as of the release of this game.",
