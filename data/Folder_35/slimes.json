    "About the game": "Of the things that came with the arrival of an alien being, the weakest of all of them are the slimes. Nobody knows what exactly these things are, but, as weak as they are, nobody's succeeded in destroying one of the dungeons from which they spawn. Julius Anderson, a modern day crusader, takes the job of eradicating one of these slime dens. Hired on to help him is, well, Julius refuses to learn his name, on account of him being 'diseased' with magic, but he's a healer. Through teeth-clenched teamwork, can the duo reach the bottom floor and destroy the source of the slimes? Slimes is a 3-4 hour long dungeon crawler about two guys clearing a dungeon of slimes. Most of the story is told through side stories, which you get for clearing each floor. Kill them all and maybe there's a happy ending at the end of it all. Features: 3-4 hours of content, split between battles and visual novel-esque side stories! Basic yet engaging combat against slimes that get angry when battles go for too long! Hidden bosses! Steam achievements! Bonus PDF in the game files!",
