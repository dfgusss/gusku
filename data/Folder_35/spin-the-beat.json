    "About the game": "Jump-n-dodge couch-multiplayer arcade action to the beat of the music! --- Spin the Beat is a game designed to bring friends together for some good-old-fashioned couch-multiplayer fun. With simple controls and simple objectives, it's a game that anyone can pick up and play. You and up to three friends are dropped into a small environment which quickly comes to life in bright colors and intense sounds as simple but devious enemies do everything in their power to knock you and your friends off the edge. You can work together to keep the game going for as long as possible … or knock each other around to try to earn the highest score! Rack up points by surviving consecutive waves, defeating enemies, and defeating each other. Watch out for sudden events that can mix up gameplay, including power-ups and wild changes in the world's behavior! Spin the Beat can be played with 1 to 4 simultaneous players on a single screen. --- FEATURES - Rapid-fire gameplay that keeps you guessing - Random events which mix up gameplay as soon as you think you've seen every trick the world can throw your way - One simple objective: Don't fall off! - Six color-coded enemies with wildly varying behaviors, but who share the common goal of knocking you off the tiny world - Simple, intuitive controls that make it easy to pick up and play - Play how you want - go for points in Party Mode or compete to be the last one standing in Survival Mode - Semi-procedural music – no two play sessions will have exactly the same soundtrack! - Multiple environments, each with their own distinct visual style, soundscape, and gameplay twists --- Spin the Beat is an enhanced and expanded remake of BeatBox , a student game developed at DigiPen Institute of Technology in 2014 by the creator of Spin the Beat . --- TECHNICAL NOTES Spin the Beat requires 1 to 4 Xbox 360 gamepads. Keyboard controls are available for Player 1 only. Spin the Beat uses the XCI Unity package for player input, which specifically requires Xbox 360 gamepads. To use other gamepads, it is recommended that Windows users use the x360ce third-party software to rebind controls, and Mac users use the Enjoyable third-party software to rebind controls.",
