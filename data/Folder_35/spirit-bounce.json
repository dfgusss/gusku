    "About the game": "Spirits are responsible for the whole balance of life on Earth, from the seeds germinating, to the rain that falls and even the changing of the seasons. This balance is threatened after the birth of a spirit of darkness that corrupts all spirits that were on the planet. Now Ignis, Aqua and Spark are the only ones available for a difficult mission to restore balance in the world. A fun adventure awaits you in Spirit Bounce, a reinterpretation of the classic brick-breakers that started the history of video games. • Different playable characters with varying powers, attributes and difficulty levels. • Face a powerful boss at the end of each world. • Create your own levels with the scenario editor or look for levels created by other players. • Extra unlockable content. • Global ranking of score and time in Speed-run mode.",
