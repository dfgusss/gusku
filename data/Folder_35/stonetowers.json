    "About the game": "In this town-building tower-defence hybrid, you control a group of settlers in an unknown and hostile land. You must guide them as they turn the wilderness into their new home. Will your walls crumble and your people flee, or will your towers stand tall as your settlement prospers? Build Design and build your town from the ground up! Place farms, houses, quarries and more as you craft the infrastructure and economy that your people will call home. Defend Build walls and towers to hold off the waves of otherworldly beings that attack every night! Plan your defences carefully to funnel your enemies past a variety of towers before they reach your delicate crystal nexus. Research Discover new and improved uses of magic as your town progresses from a fragile wooden stronghold to the mightiest of citadels! Learn about new materials, towers, buildings and more as you progress through the tech tree.",
