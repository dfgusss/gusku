    "About the game": "You messed up bad this time, Cupid. You got a little trigger-happy. People who should not be falling in love, ARE. Oops. Your boss Venus is not impressed. Now your job at CUPID CO. is on the line. Get back in Venus’ good graces and make up for your mistakes in this VR archery game. Use your bow and arrow to balance the natural order by matching animals, or in some cases, culling the overpopulation. Test your skills and accuracy in different locations and seasons. Remember to watch out for those environmental 'accidents”! Good luck, Cupid! No single game will be the same, as animals have a mind of their own. Learn the different creatures quirks and how they act between themselves as you progress, in order for you to get the best possible score. There's always something new to figure out. Campaign mode offers an increasingly challenging experience and story as you try to salvage your job. Sandbox mode allows a great amount of customization options like animal combinations, levels, oh ...and TNT. Features Different Game Modes - Objective, Economy, and Genocide to name a few, that change how you match animals. Style - Vibrant and colourful locations that evolve throughout the campaign. Unique gameplay - a fun fusion of VR archery and puzzle matching, giving the game a little bit more 'heart'. Quirky animals of all shapes and sizes that each impact the levels. Watch out for those pesky wolves!",
