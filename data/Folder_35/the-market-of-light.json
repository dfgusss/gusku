    "About the game": "Notice - 09/29/2021 The game will launch at the resolution set on your PC. If the resolution is set to higher than full HD and the frame rate gets too low, you can try either of the following methods to lock the resolution to full HD. -At the title screen, follow the guide at the bottom right and enter the F key. -In the exit menu, follow the guide at the bottom right and enter the F key. This is a short game and tech demo created with the early access build of Unreal Engine 5. The player is a firefly that collects orbs of light scattered around the market. Play time: 15 - 30 minutes A small-town marketplace seems huge from the perspective of a tiny firefly. Experience a meticulously rendered world from a micro view point! Inspired by the excitement of the announcement by Unreal Engine 5, we created this game. 'Nanite' handles unlimited polygons, 'Lumen', which allows for perfectly dynamic lighting, and the latest visual effect tool, 'Niagara'. Even one would have been sensational, but it's a major event to have all of them come out at almost the same time. Tech Demo Highlights Super close-up presentation Dynamic sunlight changes Progressive visual effects -Film-quality assets can be used with almost no modification The 3 colors of light represent Nanite, Lumen, and Niagara. This game features next-generation representations of these new functions. We live in an interesting time, a turning point of technology, enjoy it with us!",
