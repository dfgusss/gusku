[Key Description] A, D: move space: jump Left click: hang wire Right-click: cancel wire [warning] If it hits a red wall or the tip of its head hits a wall, it will fall. This game cannot be saved. [advice] Overcome terrain with creative routes and methods As you climb, your head may hit obstacles and return to the starting point. This will be painful, but it will make you more proficient and stronger. I do not recommend this game if you want to finish the game easily. I recommend this game to those who like difficult things and are persistent challengers. good luck...",
