    "About the game": "THREE KINGDOMS STORY: CONUSSIA “Three Kingdoms Story: Conussia” is a story of high intrigue set in the Royal Court of the Kingdom of Conussia. PLOT The ruler of Conussia has disappeared, and next in line to the throne is a young princess who is desperate for help. The Royal Army has been decimated in a recent battle with the forces of darkness and reduced to a fraction of its power, and the only survivor from the powerful circle of Royal Mages is a coward that fled the battle. With these, the Princess must consolidate her claim to the throne facing challenges from political factions both inside and outside her own Court, as well as protecting her land from the encroaching dark forces that grow in strength and numbers every day. You arrive in Conussia as a stranger, having foiled a kidnap attempt against the Princess and are drawn into the complex political plots of the Royal Court, as different political factions scheme for control of the Princess and her Kingdom. Conussia is a Kingdom balanced on a knife-edge, and the actions of a single stranger will have profound consequences for the entire nation. GAMEPLAY Three Kingdoms Story: Conussia is a visual novel with RPG elements and non-linear plot progression, with multiple endings. In order to progress, you must get to know the various characters in the Royal Court, find their secrets and decide how to best use them to further your position within each faction. You can make alliances and friendships, and nurture these or exploit them by betraying your allies to further your own position in court. But be warned – trust is a rare and precious commodity in Conussia, your allies might be just as likely to betray you too… This game is strictly 18+ only due to extreme sexual content.",
