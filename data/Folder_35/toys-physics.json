    "About the game": "Toys &amp; Physics is a side-view physics puzzle game. The player needs to collect the stars using the laws of physics. The character can take 2 shapes - square and circle - this is actively used in solving puzzles. The game has 80 levels that become more difficult as you progress, new items/mechanics are added as you progress, making the gameplay more interesting and challenging. I bet only 25% of people will pass all the levels and only 1% will collect all 3 stars on every level. So if you are looking for challenging puzzles, you are welcome! Game Features: Simple gameplay mechanics Many levels Steam Achievements support Some levels are difficult to pass",
