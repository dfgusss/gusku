    "About the game": "Save the family and friends of childhood from the terrible monster! Help the village of Little Firs to survive the invasion of the cruel lord and achieve prosperity! Really? Yes, and you can also just run away from him and settle down in a free city by the sea, start a family there and earn your living with guitar songs, merry knights, wizards and robbers. The Lords of the Damned Land is a game book or text quest about adventure in a magical world devastated after a brutal war of magicians. From the starting settlement can go north, south, west or east - and in each direction to find a solution for the main quest of the game. This is a game in the genre of Interactive Fiction and Text-Based RPG, where you travel between locations, enter into dialogues, make moral choices. You can absolutely ignore the goal of the game and just choose a quiet life line. Technical possibilities here, as in the book, in which you can choose the development of the plot. It has many endings - from the very bad, in which all died, to the magnificent heroic, where the protagonist defeats the monster, saves parents and neighbors, and makes the village a new city. And of course, there are intermediate options, where either you live well, or at the cost of heroic sacrifice you save the village. Game world: Once upon a time there was a thriving empire ruled by the greatest magician in the world. After two rebellions of smaller magicians, the vast country became wastelands, cities disappeared or became necropolises where only ghouls walk. A huge number of artifacts and battle spells scattered around the world, turning the peaceful forests, meadows and swamps in dangerous places, infected with malicious magic and teeming with terrible creatures. Game features: The game has 550 thousand characters and 80 thousand words on 1000 pages. Sometimes the pages follow one after another, like in regular books. And sometimes turn into hubs, where you can ask caravaners about the world, listen to strange tales, learn secrets about neighboring locations or hints at solutions, and of course - to make a choice: go with this caravan or wait for a completely different?",
