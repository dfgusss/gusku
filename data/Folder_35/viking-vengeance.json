    "About the game": "Viking Vengeance is a God-Worshiping Rogue-lite Dungeon Crawler ARPG set in a historical fiction world. You play as a Templar with pagan origins who rediscovers his roots and learns to wield the powers of the Norse Gods in his quest to change the destiny of his people and stop Ragnarok. Worship Gods Pray and bring sacrifices to Gods to Unlock Alternate Fighting Styles and blessings. Each God is unique and will come with its own set of powers and abilities. You can unlock their power by filling up your devotion bar. The more you worship them, the faster your avatar forms will levelup, but neglecting one might anger him. The Gods are not always reliable but they can be pleased to improve your chances of receiving their help in battle, by using certain equipment or passive runes. Discovering God Runes will unlock new Skills for avatar state. Turn into avatars of Gods and wield Thor’s hammer, use Loki's mischief skills or Odin's power to crush your enemies and wreak vengeance for your people. Classes There are two different classes to choose from in Viking Vengeance, each with its unique gears and weapons. Characters in Viking Vengeance are visually distinct and grant access to different skills and items that have to be used in combination with the Worship mechanic. These combinations provide unique experiences every time and influence the way you approach encounters. Each class can execute enemies after their health reaches a certain threshold. Executing enemies will either give you health back or extra blood currency which can be used for reviving, boosting your devotion or for other gains. Death Cheating Viking Corruption is real even in the after life. For the right price you will be able to negotiate your way out of Valhalla and bribe the Valkyrie that’s coming for your soul. Your options will be Reviving on the spot for a blood cost or going back to your last saved location, which will restart the world and make you a target for other valkyries, who want to recover the soul that is owed to them. Grow Permanently Stronger Leveling up in Viking Vengeance consists in choosing different new skills, upgrades for old ones to suit your preferred playstyle or new equipment which can be upgraded to fit your needs. Seek Knowledge Get different perspectives from a variety of NPCs on how the events of this world unfold and notice that many things are not as they seem at first glance. Anything can be a weapon The environment and game physics can be used to gain the upper hand in battle. Throw your enemies with Thor’s hammer in the fires set by his continuously falling thunders, trick enemies into falling in traps, broken ice, cliffs or take advantage of Loki’s poisonous daggers which will permanently remain on the ground after his avatar is used. Fimbulwinter Challenges At the end of your journey, Fimbulwinter, the omen of Ragnarok, will arrive to bring new challenges, like Frost Draugar, the Frost Dragon and unpredictable foes that will be in the most unexpected places. Like you, they will all be desperate to find the legendary weapon which would help them survive the upcoming doom. Secrets still need to be unraveled but the world is changing with you. As you will find out, the realms are now more connected than ever. Regular updates We’re committed to make Viking Vengeance a long-term game with regular updates and additions, including features, Acts, gameplay content, playable characters and items. /",
