    "Release date": "Dec 25, 2021",
    "About the game": "On a distant planet called Onnet, unknown to humanity, there were a people who, even with more advanced technologies, lived in peace for many years. But a dark cloud arrived and brought with it a mysterious giant ship releasing its killing machines with an order to eliminate the entire population of the plant. Onlyver, a military man killed in battle against the machines, is resurrected by a medical robot and given the chance to avenge his people. Inspired by games like ScourgeBringer, Dead Cells, Nuclear Throne, Void Heart follows the Rogue-Lite style where your death is permanent and no checkpoints. Clear all the rooms on each map to collect items that give you special abilities. Rare items can be purchased in stores hidden around the map. Slaughtered enemies leave experience points to level up your character. Every level you gain, one level point is added and can be used to improve your character. The character can equip up to 3 weapons, automatic pistol, machine gun and shotgun. Weapon parts that improve damage, reload capacity, and firing rate can be collected in chests and purchased in stores. Sword-equipped robots can be bought in stores and will help you in battle against the machines. Defeat the bosses in each area, being a mini boss and a bigger and more powerful boss, to go to the next level. If you die, you will lose your items and weapon upgrades and will only get experience points, level points and current level. Void Heart is under development and a lot of cool stuff is still to come.",
