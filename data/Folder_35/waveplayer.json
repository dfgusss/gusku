    "About the game": "WavePlayer is a single player 2D pixelart wave survival game, the goal of the game is to defeat all of the enemies that spawn in intervals using a legendary Warrior and emerge victorious from the depths of the deep circling forests and caves. You can play as a mage with explosive energy blasts or a spirit archer of the wood, who's arrows can pierce through multiple monsters. Experience a beautiful 2D Pixel game as you battle jumping acidic slimes and angry flies who phase through the terrain. Winding lush forest with the sounds of an ancient past and elder trees looming over the sky sheltering the creatures below. An ancient cave with glowing mushrooms that paint a magenta film over the towering cavern columns. Learn to traverse the map, dodging enemies and surviving the waves using the environment to achieve victory. You're trapped by an unknown magical force in a looping world until you defeat all the enemies that stand in your way. You hear branches snap, something is coming your way. You prepare yourself to fight.",
