    "About the game": "'Wide Open' was born out of a love for old-school, top-down offroad racing games. Offroad racing has come a long way since the days of the 8 bit and 16 bit systems and this game intends to reflect those evolutions. With a fully deformable terrain, you can be sure that no lap will be like the last. You can enjoy timing big jumps and drifting corners. There are many terrain types like asphalt, dirt, sand, mud, and more! Numerous tracks are available and more will be on their way. Features Over 64 tracks! Each track is unique in that they all have different soil types and can range from large, fast tracks to tight stadium tracks. Real time terrain deformation Each track features unique soil types that deform under the wheels of each vehicle. The terrain changes rapidly so no two laps are the same. Soil types include mud, loam, sand, hard-packed clay, and many others. Multiple vehicles Currently, there are six vehicles to choose from, each with different handling characteristics so you can choose the vehicle that suits you the best. Replay system With our new replay system, you can relive your best finishes and your worst crashes. There are four camera modes available so you can get the angle you are looking for. Camera modes The game features a fully adjustable orbital, top-down camera as well as a follow camera for those who want to use it.
