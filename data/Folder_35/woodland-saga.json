    "About the game": "Woodland Saga is a turn-based versus (online) strategy game. In Woodland Saga you lead an army of woodland critters against an AI or against another player. Your goal is to either destroy your opponent's base camp or capture 3 different magical shrines. During your turn you can either play an army card from your hand which places a group unit onto the board, or you can assign a new command to a group unit that is already on the board. Knowing when and where to place units and when and where to move them to will be key in winning the game as different biomes, height difference, towns and other components will make a meaningful impact on your decisions. Features online play against other players 15+ different cards to find hours of fun!
