    "About the game": "Survive Everyone is dead. Your only chance is the escape shuttle... but you need fuel and oxygen. And find the codes for the self-destruct... just hope IT does not find you first. What is it about? The basic idea was a 2D survival horror game, loosely base on the old ZX81 game 'Alien'. You are alone on a spaceship and have to survive long enough to get the lifeboat up and running and escape from the horror. There are some Rogue-like elements, since your objectives and the items you find in a level are randomized. The initial release contains a three part tutorial to get you familiar with the game concepts and three different levels for the main game. Replay value is achieved by combining the rogue-like elements with several difficulty levels. Initial Features 2D stealthy survival horror gameplay 3 tutorial levels 3 different levels for the single player 'Last Survivor' mode. Rogue-like randomized objectives and item placements 3 difficulty levels Early access? Once the basic gameplay works ('Last Survivor' mode), there are several directions I could take the game: 'Fire Team (single player)' : Survive with a team of four characters to add tactical depth to the game and allow more complex game play? 'Fire Team (couch co-op)' : This would also make couch co-op possible - why control all heroes when you can survive together with some friends? 'Escape from Hallas Prime' : Or maybe focus on single player and add a story campaign with NPCs, in-engine cutscenes and more complex gameplay? This is where your opinion comes in - if you like the gameplay and would like to see the game grow, which direction should I take?",
