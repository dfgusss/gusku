    "About the game": "Because of the aggressive tendencies shown by your semi-sentient species, the Council has bestowed upon you the honor of relieving their boredom by fighting for the propagation rights of the species of your world. The combat will be weaponless. The matches will take place in a holographic simulation of you or your opponent's homeworld, and will be farcast to the Council Chamber. If you fight well enough, you will be given the honor of defeat at the hands of the Grand Champion. Failure to fight will result in automatic forfeiture of propagation rights. Game Features 8 characters, 2 champions, and a nasty surprise. High resolution (SVGA) 640x480 mode for much greater detail. The fully rendered foes are the largest, most detailed characters even seen in a fighting game, nearly as tall as the entire screen. Innovative panoramic screen panning, zooming and real-time scaling, shadows and special effects. Interactive, animated environments, with special dangers! Special moves, combos, resurrections, and humiliations. Story mode, Free Play mode, and Training mode. The Blood Flow Meter lets you adjust the gore. Flesh ripping, blood sucking, claw slashing, tail whipping, karate kicking, fist ramming, body slamming, blood spurting action - need we say more?",
