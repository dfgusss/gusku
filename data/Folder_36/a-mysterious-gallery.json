    "About the game": "You have just received a letter. Someone challenges you. You go to the indicated place and discover a painting gallery like no other... Indeed, your challenge is to gather more than 200 paintings by solving puzzles! In A Mysterious Gallery you have to get paintings by solving three kinds of puzzles. Most of the puzzles are inspired by hidden object games. Indeed, some paintings have a problem: an element has been erased . It's up to you to identify that element. For example: Pretty easy to guess what's missing! It's often less obvious. But there are always clues , just observe the painting carefully (position of the characters, pattern...). Then, you have to find that element, because it is hidden among all the other paintings . Then there are riddles with a code to find . The numbers or letters of the code are placed in the paintings. But they are invisible! You have to use a special object, the revealing magnifying glass. Its flash makes them appear. Fortunately there are always clues to know in which paintings and in which places the numbers and letters are hidden. Finally, there are more classic puzzles requiring action, memory, observation... When a puzzle is solved, the paintings associated with that puzzle are added to the gallery and can be viewed freely . Most are in high definition. The controls are simple and may be suitable for casual players. More than 200 paintings by real artists such as Degas, Rubens, van Gogh, Monet... Discover works of art in an original way!",
