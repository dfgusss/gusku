    "About the game": "Please bear in mind that Agony is quite an 'old school' game; non-linear, with a semi-open world, a lot of different paths, endings, exploration possibilities as well as secrets to uncover. Playing Agony is notably different than what you can get from modern, mostly linear and corridor-style horror games STORY MODE You will begin your journey as a tormented soul within the depths of hell, without any memories about your past. The special ability to control people on your path, and even possess simple minded demons, gives you the necessary measures to survive in the extreme conditions you are in. By exploring the hostile environment and interacting with other weary souls of the hellscape, the hero will soon understand that there is only one way to escape from Hell, and it will require meeting the mystical Red Goddess. AGONY MODE Agony features a full-fledged story mode as well as an open challenge system that randomly generates levels for players to explore and survive to gain new Highscores. In addition to featuring in countless “Most anticipated Horror Games 2018” lists, the kick starter financed title is set to challenge players with its brutal and malevolent environments. Agony throws you in the midst of hell where you strive to stay alive and solve the riddle behind the mysterious Red Goddess; architect of this place of sorrow and pain, and the sole entity with knowledge of how escape… but there is more to the story than it seems. Haunted by nightmare creatures, You will gain the ability to possess demons and other souls to find a way out of hell.",
