    "About the game": "Airscape: The Fall of Gravity is a fast-paced, gravity-shifting action platformer about a deep-sea octopus who has been kidnapped by a mechanical alien race. Control a Dumbo Octopus ( Grimpoteuthis abyssicola ) on a skybound adventure to save its family from the clutches of the motorized menace. Jump, dodge, and swim through a breathtaking environment full of floating islands, water formations, and robotic terrors. There's no fighting in Airscape - you'll have to rely on your wits, speed, and reflexes to navigate through the deadly gauntlets. 18 devious zones - including 60+ unique levels! Tight controls - dodge bullets, outsmart seekers, and avoid mines with ease, optimized for gamepads and keyboards! Hardcore difficulty - life as an octopus is tough, but frequent checkpoints and quick respawn times get you back to the action in no time! Five playable characters - each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses! Swim like an octopus - you'll transition smoothly between running on land and swimming through impossibly suspended water blobs! Full Orchestral Soundtrack - Your thumbs may hate you, but your ears will love you!",
