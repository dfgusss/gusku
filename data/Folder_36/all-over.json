    "About the game": "Important announcement - Sep 23, 2020 Due to the COVID-19 we had to hold off all developments and updates and cannot commit on if/when this will be changed. We feel it would be unfair to request payments for a game that is currently not supported and therefore the game would be turning into free to play (on Sep. 28) until we feel we can continue supporting &amp; developing it further. All over is an indie action RPG game filled with puzzles, missions, and monsters. Enjoy 6-12 hours of gameplay, discover the magic of Abelon and help townsfolk and magical animals versus an evil ruler. This is an early access game and fully enjoyable game. The game at its current state is playable with over 50 missions, dungeons, arena, and steam achievements, and we hope you enjoy it. We appreciate any feedback you have - feel free to post it on our community page/group. End of announcement All Over is an indie ARPG/adventure/puzzle game taking place at the kingdom of Abelon.
