    "About the game": "Arcadia is a contemporary visual novel about the advancement of technology, the isolation one feels when they don't embrace those changes, and the trappings of wanting to enjoy the past. The story centers around Roman, a recent hire at the Arcady Jazz Club, a luxurious place where one can forget the trappings of the future and enjoy the music of the past. That is, until a former co-worker, Eris, also starts working there, causing him no end of trouble as the two butt heads over how they want to improve Arcady. Their manager, Parker, does his best to keep the two in line, but only time will tell if these two will learn to cooperate towards a common goal or stay as caustic rivals. This game was originally created as part of the NaNoRen0 2018 Game Jam, and was finished in 30 days from start to finish. Roughly 2 hours of playtime.",
