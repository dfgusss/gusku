    "About the game": "Have you ever dreamt about being inside an old Arcade Machine? Inspired by the major 80’s Pop Culture references ARK-ADE harmonizes the old fast-paced Run ‘n’ Gun games with the new era of VR technology, diving you into an iconic setting to strafe enemies, protect ARK and defeat ADE. FEATURES HOW YOU MOVE IS UP TO YOU You can choose between Free Locomotion, Dash or Blink Teleport Movement to avoid motion sickness. We know that not everyone has what is called 'VR legs', should you not be comfortable with the default locomotion method you can always switch to one the others in the option menu. DIVE INTO THE 80s Plunge into the nostalgic 80’s Low-poly Sci-Fi setting. Dune , Stargate , Blade Runner , Tron , Star Wars , Idiana Jones , Space Invaders , R-Type are just some of the revered 80s sci-fi movies and videogames that inspired the setting of the game. PROTECT ARK, THE KEY TO SAVE HUMANITY Protect ARK from ADE’s army: it's the key to save humanity, the only thing that could change the future of our race forever. Some enemies will focus solely on him, you and ARK share the save life, defend it at all costs. MORPHING GUN 'This is my rifle, this is my gun, this is for fighting and this is for fun' Just one gun, a very powerful weapon that will morph into anything you need to defeat ADE and save the world will accompany you all the game long. ENJOY DESTRUCTIBLE ENVIROMENT AND COVERS Parts of the level are destructible. Be careful while choosing a cover; it might not last long enough to save you from ADE's army. On the other hand, it may also be a chance to unlock new paths to defeat ADE. UNLOCK SECRETS AND ACHIEVEMENTS Collect all the secrets and unlock all achievements for the ultimate challange! Shoot to the beat of our original soundtrack ABOUT US Four friends, three cats, one castle (which is actually a rented house and that's where the name of the company comes from) and an old sick passion for gaming. The idea of making a videogame has been with us for a long time, after a few years just thinking about it we took some time off our actual jobs and we are finally trying to follow our dream. So here it starts our journey with ARK-ADE, our first videogame. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it.",
