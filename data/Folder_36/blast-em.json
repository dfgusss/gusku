    "Release date": "Jan 22, 2014",
    "About the game": "I'm halting development on this game, there's not enough players per month or people buying it at it's previous price to make it commercially viable to fix the problems that happened when the middleware provided folded. I do have the option of removing it completely from the store but that means any of the people who bought it in the past would not be able to download it again which is unfair, so I've set the price artificially high to deter any new purchases. Protect the universe from the evil Alien robots terror-bent on eliminating the Earth and all of Humanity! Take control of the ship and blast the hell out of anything that moves and if it doesn’t move – blast it anyway to be sure. Collect coins to get points and use those points to get power-ups. Choose wisely, the wrong power-up at the wrong time is the difference between a high-score and having to press ‘Play’ again. You were warned! Key features Evil Alien Robots terror-bent on destroying you and everyone else. Semi-procedural game generation. Never play exactly the same game twice. Super hard gameplay. Super addictive gameplay. Great training in mastering your blink reflex. Source code available to buy so you can see how it was made.",
