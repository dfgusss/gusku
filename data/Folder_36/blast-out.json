Master a wide range of abilities, learn to maneuver through an ever-changing environment and laugh as your opponents fall victim to your mind games. CRAZY COMBOS Before you show off your amazing skills in the arena, you need to learn how to utilize Blast Out’s unique ability system. Players can modify any character’s set of abilities to play exactly how they want. The abilities in Blast Out are all about combos, so mastering the synergy between different abilities and their situational usefulness is the key to being unstoppable. DEADLY ARENAS The arenas in Blast Out can be just as deadly as your opponents. The environment is filled with traps and hazards that will catch you by surprise if you lose focus for even a moment. Always be aware of your surroundings and use the arena to your advantage when engaging the enemy. KNOCK-KNOCK… The core ingredient that makes the combat in Blast Out a blast, is the Knockback mechanic. Most abilities in Blast Out will send your opponents flying, preferably into that sea of lava that just appeared. The Knockback serves as a tool to quickly eliminate your foes and is vital to both utilize and avoid. OTHER FEATURES INCLUDE Multiple characters, with unique traits giving full control over your playstyle. Deep character customization, with over 200+ combinations.
