    "About the game": "C.A.T.S. is an action-adventure stealth game where you will become James Bones a skilled hacker in a top secret mission for the doggerment of Og Uniti. In this secret mission you will have to steal the blueprints of a devastating nuclear weapon. Those blueprints are hidden in the secret base of the Carpagon in the middle of the enemy territory, in GudCut. To enter the Carpagon you'll contact an insider, which will lend you inside the secret base. From that point on you will be on your own. Using the skills you learned during you training will be mandatory to get through the base without getting yourself caught. The game itself is a satirical parody to classic special agent movies and games, and if you pay enough attention you'll be able to find a bunch of references in there!",
