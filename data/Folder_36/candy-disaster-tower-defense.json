    "About the game": "We are a 3D strategy tower defense game that combines traps to collect Candies. In the game, you will play Jick, the mad scientist, to help a mysterious friend collect the M89KD Energy Candies scattered on different planets. During your journey, you will meet many foreign enemies who attempt to obtain the Candies for themselves! However, your wit and wisdom will help you! Take Advantage of the Map! The EA version contains Night Club and Storm Desert. The Night Club operates in forest scenery while Storm Desert takes place in the desert with ancient pyramids. These two scenes contain different mechanics, so take advantage of that! Ice and Snow Cemetery and Candy Factory will be coming soon! Stay tuned! Understand the Skills of the Characters! In your journey of Candy Disaster, you will encounter different enemies. Some with powerful skills! Choose the right trap to fight against them! For example, the Gravity Net can take down flying enemies by making them land. Know your enemies! Combine Traps to Create Attacks! With a variety of traps, combine different traps to create your way of attacking. For example, wooden arrows can turn into fire arrows with the help of flame; fans can change the direction of any “bullet” traps. These clever combinations are waiting to be discovered!",
