    "About the game": "DOWNLOAD THE CORRESPONDING ASSIGNMENTS -101-library This experience is a sample version of the virtual library within Cattle 101; it allows students to interact with cattle and breed information in an alternative format and is separated into three sections. Each section provides different important concepts of anatomy, scoring, and general information about the world's most popular cattle breeds. 1. The Courtyard of Cattle contains an information array about twenty cattle breeds, including 3D models of each breed. 2. The anatomy level includes 3D models for cattle bones, muscles, and digestive organs; in this level, the player can interact with the specific organs, muscles, or bones and get information about the item. 3. The last area is cattle scoring, where the player can learn about how cattle are scored in real life; the two examples we have to present are dairy cattle locomotion scoring and beef body condition scoring.",
