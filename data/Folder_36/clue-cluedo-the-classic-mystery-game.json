    "About the game": "Hello Detective You’re invited to the most deadly party of the season! Join your friends and family, become iconic characters and enter the Mansion! Soon after you arrive the host’s body is discovered at the bottom of the stairs. The house is on lockdown until the puzzle is solved and the criminal is revealed. Whodunit? With what weapon? Where? There’s six suspects, six weapons, nine rooms, and only one answer… Play the part of an iconic guest! Gather up to 6 players and become Miss Scarlett, Colonel Mustard, Doctor Orchid, Reverend Green, Mrs. Peacock or Professor Plum. Any one of them could be guilty, all you have to do is crack the case! Roll the dice and move between the rooms. At the start of each game, one suspect, one weapon, and one room will be removed from the deck, and the remaining cards will be dealt to the players. If you ask: “was it Colonel Mustard with the Rope in the Drawing Room”, a player holding the Colonel, the Rope or the Drawing Room must show you a card. Enter every room in search of answers! Test your powers of deduction. The virtual Cluesheet will automatically keep track of the cards you’ve been shown and cross them off your list, but you can add ticks and crosses of your own. Pay attention to what your fellow investigators are asking and who replies - you may be able to find answers without even having to ask! Once you know the answer… It’s a race against time! You must be on the scene of the crime to make your accusation, so roll the dice, get to the correct room and unravel the mystery! If your accusation is incorrect, you will be eliminated from the game. Don’t risk letting the criminal escape! Be sure before you show your hand. FEATURES • Online multiplayer for up to 6 players • Single Player Mode against customisable AI suspects • Private games with friends and family members • Cross-platform multiplayer - play together with your favourite people on PC, iOS, Android and Nintendo Switch • Out-smart fans around the world with weekly online leaderboards • Unlock the Season Pass for a selection of 10 themes that transform the suspects, weapons and locations! Travel around the world and back in time. Be iconic characters, and test your brain in wild places. The mysteries are endless…",
