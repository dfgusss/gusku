    "About the game": "You thought being a mall cop would be an easy job. Your chill night turns into a nightmare as you are hunted. Coffin Mall is an atmospheric retro survival horror game where you'll experience your first night at the job: come in, talk to your boss, patrol the halls. Things later go wrong and you'll realize one thing: You can run, you can hide, but internal combustion tends to beat flesh and bones . Why is this happening? Why you? How do you get out? How do you fight back? These questions are for you to figure out. Features: A tightly packed[30-ish minutes] main story to keep you on the edge of your seat as the game goes from atmospheric to terrifying, culminating in a big face-off. Achievements and speedrun leaderboards to challenge yourself and play the game in different ways. A great dark-synth soundtrack to enhance the mood as your adventure proceeds. A bonus mode where the tables turn.",
