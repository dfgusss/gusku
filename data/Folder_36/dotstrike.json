    "About the game": "DotStrike is a 3D online shooter in which alien invaders in the form of colored spheres fight each other in a seaport. At the moment, two game modes are fully implemented: 'Team Confrontation' and 'Confrontation'. In the 'Team Confrontation' mode, players are divided into two teams: red and blue. The goal of each side is to score a given number of points faster than the rest of the team. In the 'Confrontation' mode, each player is for himself. The strongest alien will win this fight. The plot of the game All weapons have infinite ammo. This is all thanks to the alien technology of instant cartridge fabrication. For example, in an RPG, after a shot, a rocket grows in the muzzle of a grenade launcher. But the aliens are not fighting alone. In addition to them, there is another side. It's called 'Unknown Power'. Humans didn't just watch the alien conflict. From time to time, a bomber rises into the air and drops bombs on the warring aliens. In addition to people, there are natural disasters that also did not stand aside. This is a suddenly rising magma or a tornado that sucks everything in its path. From the nearest plans to add game modes: 'Zombies', '2122', 'Serious Ball'. As well as new guns, including alien ones.",
