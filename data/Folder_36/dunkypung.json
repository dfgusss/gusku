Be annihilated over and over again, but (maybe) love it! CASUAL MODE. For people who are weak. MOAR FEATUREZ!: LEVELS. Experience SIX STUPID HARD LEVELS, each with FOUR WAVES OF DEADLY DEATH! It's not as easy as you thiiiiinnnnkk!!!!! UNLOCKS. LEVEL UP and get some things to help you do the thing or just make your thing cooler-ish. Also maybe farting and stuff?!!! CREDITS. Learn who made the game, because whatever! OPTIONS!. Customize the many things and stuff. MAIN MENU. EXPERIENCE the MAIN MENU in all it's glistening glory.
