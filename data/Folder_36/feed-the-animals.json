    "About the game": "This game helps improving children's coordination skills. 'Grab an animal and help them reach their destination: a crate of food. But be careful not to touch any of the tree stumps.' Level 18 is a bonus where you ought to avoid windblown leaves and collect the apples, with Ladybird. Featuring 17 levels where you should grab and help the animals make their way to the feeder. Levels are designed to increase with difficulty. Animals are animated in a childish way: they 'stride' and track the movement of the mouse with their eyes. Level 18 is a bonus where you ought to avoid windblown leaves and collect the apples, with Ladybird. There is a wide range of animals you can choose from: Elephant, Rhino, Hippo, Bear, Cow, Horse, Deer, Lion, Tiger, Pig, Panda, Sheep, Monkey, Dog, Cat, Rabbit and Fox. The big elephant has to complete only a turn till the crate, while the fox must walk alot. Suitable for small children who are not yet confident using the mouse. If the task appears to be too hard there is the option to rescale the animal. (as an alternative to reducing difficulty it would be advisable to purchase a mouse specifically for children)",
