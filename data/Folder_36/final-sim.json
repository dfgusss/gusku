    "About the game": "'Final_Simulation' was designed to invoke unprecedented levels of fear and paranoia in whoever is unlucky enough to view its three personalized VHS tapes. If you can watch them in their entirety, the simulation will apply one final test before giving out a reward. Survive all three of the tests presented to you, if you can. The simulation does not want you to win. Whatever it has sent is not a friend. The danger is real, time is short, and they are watching. Enter the Final Simulation and experience your own greatest fears. A unique twist on classic first-person horror games, includes an interactable environment and high-quality props. Navigate three levels of puzzles and code-cracking. Experience VHS-themed graphics, nostalgically terrifying. An intermittent story that reveals itself as you play. The Final_SIM will take you approximately three-quarters to one hour to complete. Good Luck. Final_SIM is a student horror project developed in under a year using outsourced assets.",
