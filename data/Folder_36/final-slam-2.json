I would like to thank all of you who tried and played the game, like or dislike it. A lot of the players dislike Final Slam 2 and if you compare it to other full-blown mainstream competitive fighting games and you don't like it, well, your dislike for the game is justified and I understand. With very limited budget and with only one person working on the game (which is myself), as opposed to bigger-sized indie or mainstream companies, I understand that I cannot provide the best graphics, gameplay and most modern features to satisfy the hardcore fighting gamer. Therefore, I decided to make it more of a casual game and focus on the uniqueness of the game that not many fighting games have. And this uniqueness comprises: 1. the character creation mode with speed creation settings 2. Final Slam Season Mode where you can win titles and fight up a league (fight with characters you created as well) 3. the automatically-generated AI fighters in season mode. Other features include the ability to export your fighter to a text string that can be saved and shared anywhere you like. Therefore, it is possible to create an unlimited amount of characters. Some players have had a lot of fun playing the game, but some haven't and others don't even care about what the game has to offer. But anyway, I accept all opinions and judgment about the game and welcome you to try it out at a low cheap price. You can request for a Steam refund if you feel it is not for you. Thanks again.",
