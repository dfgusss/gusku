During all the levels in the game, you will be controlling Fish Glutton, a clown fish, driving him through different 2D landscapes full of different fish and monsters. Depending on the fish edges color, you should eat it by touching it, or avoid it by not touching it or not letting them touch you(refer to the legend/map below). You can attack boss monsters by throwing a trash can at them, which starts spawning only when fighting a monster boss. Make sure to touch the trash can on time because it will leave it you ignore it and will have to wait until another trash can spawn. You win each level if you reach the end of each one of them with at least one life. You beat the entire game once you passed all 40 levels.
