    "About the game": "Have Fun and Get Fit. Fitforce is an interactive exercise game divided into multiple engaging minigames designed based on popular and effective exercise moves. You will be working out using your smartphone as a controller and of course having some fun while playing Fitforce Fitforce requires you to download its mobile app and connect your smartphone to your PC with QR code before you can start playing so you can navigate and interact with the game. Your mobile phone must have Gyroscope and Accelerometer sensors to be supported, we use these sensors to track your movement. We recommend wearing tight pants with a pocket to prevent your phone from slipping out of the pocket and to make the sensor accurately track your movement. Features 3 Modes, 3 Styles: (1) Classic - Choose any minigames you own to play for a single round. (2) Boss Fight - Challenge yourselves and journey to beat evil bosses. You will follow the minigame route and fight the powerful boss at the end of your path. (3) Program - If you have some workout goals on your mind, then you might want to follow our preset focusing on a certain goal or a body part like Cardio, Running, Core or Legs. Nothing matches your preference? You can create your custom workout program by choosing owned minigames and the amount of sets you want to repeat these minigames. 10+ Exercise Minigames: Start out with 4 FREE starter minigames + 2 weekly FREE TRIAL to unlockable minigames, you can buy more minigames to unlock them forever. Fun and Fitness: These minigames will make you sweat and that will be so much fun.

The result is enjoyable minigames with different gameplays and world settings that will make you healthier as you play. Physical Movement Tracking: Keep working out to keep playing. We track your physical movement through the sensors and Fitforce app in your phone. To control your character in minigames, you will have to do exercise moves correctly.
