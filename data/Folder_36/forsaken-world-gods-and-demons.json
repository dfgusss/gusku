    "About the game": "Forsaken World: Gods and Demons is an fantasy RPG of grand proportions. Dive into a world of never-ending adventure where treasure and glory await the willing. Raid a dragon's lair, search for lost artifacts, or just enjoy some fishing in the shade. Your actions will influence the world around you through epic story events that will shape the future of Calindor. Leave your mark and become a legend. ※Features※ [A Vibrant World] Immerse yourself in the breathtaking landscapes of Forsaken World. Take to the skies to get the best view of Calindor as you explore every inch of the land and uncover its many secrets. Visit the hearty Dwarves for their finest spirits after a long adventure or bask in the enchanting melodies of the Elves to lift away your troubles. Interact with other players and trade your goods and resources in the name of prosperity. [Large-Scale PvP] The invading Storm Legion, warring factions, and savage wildlife have turned the world into a dangerous place, but not all threats are external. Amidst the chaos, guilds fiercely clash with one another over land and resources. Will you form alliances and uphold peace, or conquer in the name of eternal glory? Whatever you decide, you are not alone! Create or join a guild, build Guild Fortresses, and become a savior or a conqueror! [Play Your Way] Change your class at any time and specialize your character any way you see fit. Mix-and-match abilities and talents to fit your combat style, and customize your appearance with cosmetics to bring out the true you. No two players are the same in Forsaken World. Develop your own playstyle using a wide variety of customization options and test it against the greatest challenges. [Dynamic Gameplay] A new adventure begins every time you log in. Start your day with a stroll through the market for some potions. Meet up with some friends for an old fashion dungeon crawl, or work on some tradeskills at your leisure. A simple outing for herbs may trigger a special event that leads to an epic dragonslaying adventure. No matter what type of player you are, you'll find your calling in Forsaken World.",
