Features: Dynamic gameplay combined with a frightening experience Physics based gameplay - It gives you the possibility to do whatever you want. Every single dynamic object can be dragged, carried or thrown which gives you enormous freedom. Narration - While playing, the character is talking, telling the player what he feels, if he's scared, or what he thinks about the current situation. Challenge! - Grimind isn't an easy game, so you can forget about holding just one key and passing through the levels. Besides dexterity and input skills, there is also a large number of logic puzzles to solve. Your brain will be tested and you'll not get bored.",
