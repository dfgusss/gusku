    "About the game": "Hand Cannon Virtuoso is a VR roguelite bullet hell where you build your arsenal by collecting cards. Fight your way to the top of a shape-shifting tower filled with powerful foes! Climb a Shape-Shifting Tower Begin your term at the Combat Robot Academy - a deadly, shape-shifting skyscraper where you must reach the top to graduate. Build your Arsenal by Collecting Cards Find weapon cards that give you new powers and attacks. Each card has unique strengths and weaknesses so you need to collect cards that work well together. Defeat Powerful Rivals Overcome a cast of powerful foes. Challenging bullet hell combat is core to the gameplay. Learn to counter many enemies and uncover the tower's mysteries as you ascend. FAQs If I have an Oculus headset, do I have to play using SteamVR? Nope! The game includes a launch option to play using the Oculus SDK which is what I would recommend if you have an Oculus headset. Why is the game so hard? I want the game to be difficult but fair. Your first few runs might be rough, but I hope you'll ultimately find the challenge satisfying once you master the game's mechanics. What do you mean 'roguelite'? Hand Cannon Virtuoso is a roguelite in the sense that it features: Permadeath: If you die, you need to start climbing from the bottom of the tower. Out-Of-Run Progression: Even though you have to start from the bottom of the tower after death, you will still unlock rewards that persist across climbs such as new Weapon Cards you can use during your runs. Procedural Content: Each time you climb, the sequence of encounters you need to fight through will change. Will this game make me motion sick? I do my best to prevent motion sickness but the game's locomotion is pretty fast-paced. If you have concerns, I'd suggest trying the game and refunding if it doesn't work for you.",
