Your fiancee is missing and you find a hideous bloody skull and spinal chord draped across her bed! Is it hers? What is going on? The only clue left behind is an engraved invitation for you to enter... THE ORDER OF THE HARVEST MOON ...a mysterious organisation that controls the town in way you don't (or can't) understand. Is the order behind this gruesome execution? What are their motives? One thing is certain, you're going to get to the bottom of this killing, or die trying.",
