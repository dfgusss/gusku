    "About the game": "Joseph is a bank robber who during the escape is involved in a fatal accident. Now he wakes up in a place that looks like the same city but it is actually of a kind of limbo in which Joseph will have to turn into a warrior to face your worst feelings and sins, and receive a second chance. Getting to the end is practically impossible. Using only one sword and needing a lot of skill, the player will need to survive 25 waves to be worthy of a second chance to live in the world of mortals. Hate Wave is a mix of the gameplay and difficulty of Dark Souls and the wave mode of Call of Duty. With realistic graphics, the player will face several monsters with different skills and artificial intelligence difficult to decipher which his next move. Few will reach the end, but whoever succeeds will be properly rewarded. This game is aimed at raising funds to create a much larger and more professional project. All players who manage to reach the end of Hate Wave will receive a free access key for our next project.",
