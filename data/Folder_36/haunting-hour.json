Haunting Hour is a cross-platform multiplayer VR escape room experience that mixes a silly atmosphere with serious puzzle solving. Players have one hour to complete a series of physical and mental challenges while brewing potions, chasing cats, and generally wrecking the place. If they can break the spell binding them to the castle, they just might escape before the witch comes home. Silliness aside, the game is a challenge, and many players will have to make multiple attempts if they want to escape the evil witch’s clutches. The castle is devious, but the rewards are bountiful. Special achievements and challenges will earn players unique costumes. Work hard and communicate with your team or you won’t stand a ghost of a chance! The witch is out and now the party starts! Key Features Integrated Voice Chat through Steam. Insidious puzzles, across a range of mechanics, to challenge your wits and abilities. Unlockable character skins for spooky customization. Unique rooms to explore. Play with your friends or rally with complete strangers. Work together to solve puzzles or chuck plates at your teammates until they rage Cross-platform support for Oculus,WMR and Vive through Steam. * Everyone in the party doesn't need the same headset to play together. * Playing in a full on 3.3m X 3.0m space is highly suggested, but not necessary!",
