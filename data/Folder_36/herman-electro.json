    "About the game": "The Prison Explore six puzzle-packed floors and help Herman and his friends reach the outside world! Each floor is filled with puzzles, an exit, and some special rooms. As you puzzle your way through floors, you'll build up an assortment of consumable tools to help you in your journey. Failure sends you back to the start, but with each attempt the layout of the factory changes completely. You'll need to think on your feet! The Puzzles Most rooms in the prison contain an electricity-based puzzle, which you'll need to spend tools in to beat. Each puzzle has many possible solutions that require different tools. You might cut a wire to prevent a bomb box from detonating, set off a bomb yourself to knock down concrete walls, or bait a guard into doing all the work then lead it to its doom in a pit. From pouring water on power supplies to placing a battering ram, you aren't low on options. You will need to use all your wits to find the most appropriate way to escape each room. The Tools These tools will be your best friend and your closest ally as you guide Herman to victory. Each has unique merits, so spend them cunningly. The Saw : Cut down walls and make a direct path to the exit with the saw. The Plank : Cover up pits or block off the guards using the plank. The Wire Cutters : Cut a wire and destroy a malevolent circuit with the wire cutters. The Water Bucket : Short out a power supply or create a deadly puddle of electrified water with the water bucket. The Sponge : Clean. The Brick : Break glass with the brick. The Gun : Protect yourself from guards with the gun. Supertools In addition to the run-of-the-mill basic tools listed above, you will also discover rare supertools hidden throughout the prison. These tools can be used to invent unique and creative solutions to a seemingly impossible puzzle. Although much more powerful than basic tools, supertools are much rarer, so use them wisely! The Bomb : Wreck people, things, and hopefully not yourself. The Crowbar : 'Unlock' doors within rooms. The Spring : Jump really, really far. Look before you leap. and 25 more! Key Features 7 basic tools and 30 supertools for a total of 37 different tools 6 characters with radically different playstyles Over 30 tiles Over 480 puzzles A final challenge which will make you crumble 58 achievements A minimum security metashop Hat-wearing shopkeepers Lots and lots of mushrooms Adjustable wire-size Lots of mushrooms Do not eat the mushrooms!
