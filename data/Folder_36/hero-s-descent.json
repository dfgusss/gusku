    "About the game": "In Hero's Descent, each area you visit has a strict time limit. To make matters worse, a variety of aggressive and devious monsters stand between you and the exit. Will you fight your way through them valiantly, or will you try to run past them before you end up overwhelmed? Decide quickly and carefully, every second counts in Hero's Descent, as the clock never stops ticking! Fortunately for you, a number of battle-hardened heroes are available and anxious for the opportunity to enter the dungeon. Each hero has unique abilities, strength, and growth potential. Learn them well, push them to their limits, and you just might be able to survive! KEY FEATURES Three unique characters! Each character has its own unique set of abilities and playstyle. The dungeon and your growth are tied to the character you select, allowing for a variety of play experiences. Over 20 stages! Each randomly generated run features over 20 unique stages, each with its own set of traps, enemies, and pitfalls. There are rumors of alternative paths through the ruins as well, and only the most experienced adventurers stand a chance at making it through them alive. Exciting bosses! You'll encounter a variety of soul-crushingly difficult bosses while exploring the ruins, and each will put your knowledge of the game to the test. Daily Challenges and Leaderboards! Think you're the best adventurer around? Prove it by competing on the leaderboards! Daily challenges exist for each character as well, forcing players to compete on equal ground with the same randomly-generated dungeon every day.",
