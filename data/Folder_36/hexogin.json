    "About the game": "In the year 2216 an AI equipped vessel was created and embarked on a journey to a potentially habitable planet. Its primary objective was to terraform and pre-establish a settlement for humans on the 4th planet in the Vega star system, over 25 light years from Earth. The ship took 41 years to arrive at Vega 4. Upon reaching the planet the AI determined that it could be terraformed and a signal was transmitted back to Earth to send a colony ship to arrive 200 years later. Following the terraforming activity, the AI’s directives were overwritten and it began to develop weapons technology. It spread over the entire planet in an effort to prevent humanity from inhabiting the planet. Terminals were constructed to control the weapons and defenses, and to store resources and power. Unknowingly to the AI, another AI subroutine activated in one of the terminals. Completely independent from the central, corrupted AI, this new entity had a new objective: to ensure that mankind safely reaches Vega 4. This subroutine is you and you must take back the planet at all costs.' Features Procedurally generated hex tile maps Real-time battles Expand and manage bases 25+ mission campaign Randomly generated skirmish battles Extensive map editor",
