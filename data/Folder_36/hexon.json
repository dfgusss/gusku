    "About the game": "A hardcore minimalistic puzzle game where you need to get all the hexagons on a luminous platform. But each hexagon has its own trajectory, so it will not be so simple. If you want to get distracted for a couple of hours and solve interesting problems with understandable mechanics, then you will like it. In the game you will find many levels with increasing difficulty, but you are not limited by time, the number of attempts, you can decide as much as you like, restart the level again. Have a nice game.",
