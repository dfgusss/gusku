    "About the game": "Holomento is an Indie Permadeath Action-RPG focusing on the dangerous quest of passing through the mysterious Eventide Hollow – and rebuilding it step by step. A horrible curse was laid upon the land and Eventide Hollow fell into despair. The source of the curse was also its only protection from it… the Holomento . The Holomento traps the souls of all who possess it, the mysterious book affixes itself to those who seek passage through the Hollow. If the Traveler dies, their soul is also added to the Holomento before it returns to its resting place awaiting the next Traveler . Holomento enables you to write your own story as generations of Travelers pass through a land desperate for help. Open shortcuts, reveal secrets, locate ancient relics, and build improvements to enhance the Hollow for future travels… …or just invest into the Hollow’s Stonk Market (yes, it’s real) to enrich yourself – we won’t judge! Due to the curse, travelling through Eventide Hollow is quite dangerous, with many enemies that you will have to deal with. Thankfully, Travelers are well versed in handling all kinds of weaponry, from swords and bows to handguns and… grenade launchers? Discover a variety of traditional and nontraditional weapons. Upgrade your stats by collecting hundreds of different items, including special weapons, and utilizing item skills to bring destruction to the dark creatures of the Hollow! Choose from a variety of starting classes! Each class begins with a unique set of items and changes how you will fight your way through the Hollow drastically! Due to the curse, most towns in Eventide Hollow were destroyed. Now only ruins and corruption indicate what once was a beautiful kingdom. Those that remain are hidden in plain sight. Hope is the only thing left for the surviving inhabitants – but even that is vanishing. During your journeys, you will have the opportunity to restore the Hollow to its former glory! Upgrading shops and homes, rebuilding towns, and improving the Hollow will help you on your future journeys. All towns are upgradeable via their shops and storefronts. Each town has a number of common amenities that are uniquely essential to it. Upgraded towns will reward you with many benefits and also allow you access to the local Stonk Market! It allows you to invest in local businesses and grow your influence and wealth throughout the Hollow.",
