    "About the game": "Monty lay back on his sun lounger and contemplated his situation. His previous adventures had financed these last few years of utter bliss. He had everything that a mole could want. His own island in the sun, more money than a mole could ever spend - paradise! Listening to the clear blue sea lapping at his furry feet, he surveyed his surrondings and saw nothing but unspoiled beauty. In the last few days, thoughts had appeared in his mind - he somehow missed the days of his adventuring. Monty closed his eyes and decided to take forty winks. Then the sun seemed to dim on his eyelids. 'Just a passing cloud', he thought. But within seconds, the whole island was shrouded in darkness. Opening his eyes he saw that the island was covered by one large cloud. From the cloud, rays of light beamed out which swirled and darted over the terrain as though they were looking for something. He saw a ray of light advancing towards him and felt 'butterflies' errupting into a frenzy in his stomach. HOW TO PLAY THE GAME The game is a shooter platformer genre played over five levels. You are able to select levels 1 to 4 at random, but to play level 5, you must have completed the previous four levels. Each level contains food and supplies to help you on your travels. You may find a friendly shop keeper. Spend your money wisely. Weapons can be collected and their strength upgraded when certain items are collected. Each weapon has a time limit for usage. Hidden rooms have been positioned on each level. Every area must be explored.",
