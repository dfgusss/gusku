    "About the game": "The Story You just brought a brand new AI assistant designed specifically to help with insomnia, now it's time to try to sleep. . . But something isn't quite right about tonight. Maybe getting to sleep is the least of your problems now. SleepCo's brand new Sleeping Assitance Machine is making headlines as it sells out globally only weeks after being released. Alongside their specially crafted medicine to help with insomnia, SleepCo seems to be ready to put the whole world to bed. After setting up your SAM beside your bed, taking your medicine and getting into your pyjamas, SAM wakes up to help guide you into sleep. But tonight something is different. You don't feel as tired as you usually do after taking your medicine. You hear noises all around you. SAM says to ignore it, but should you? Maybe a good night's rest will sort all of this and you won't have to worry about it in the morning. If you make it to the morning that is. Manifestations of your worst nightmares, creatures of pure horror trap you in your small bedroom, there is no escape, even closing your eyes you see the hands of the beast coming for you. What will you do? Will you ever get to sleep? Maybe it's just all in your head and you should just ignore it like SAM keeps telling you to. The Gameplay Insomnious is a survival horror game inspired by Five Nights at Freddy's, however with the added feature of being able to move around the room and get close and personal with the monsters to push them away. You are trapped in your room for the night, run around the room and hold back the night terrors while trying to get enough rest to fall asleep. These night terrors could come from everywhere, the window, the closest, the painting and even your bedroom door. But just confronting your fears by getting close enough to push them back will keep you safe for the night. Each night the monsters get more and more aggressive, on top of this the amount of time you have to sleep for increases each night. You have to manage defending yourself against the monsters of the night and getting sleep by making yourself vulnerable and resting in your bed. The main story mode will take you through 3 nights of progressively more and more difficult scenarios as you listen to your SAM try to get you to sleep. The challenge mode introduces a collection of 3 unique challenges to try to beat, it's similar to story mode just without any additional lore. Finally the custom mode allows you to set your own challenges to try to survive. In custom mode you have the ability to change each monster's difficulty (or even disable each monster), change the amount of time you need to sleep before surviving the night and even change the amount time it takes for the nightmare to kill you.",
