    "About the game": "This world used to be similar to ours but is now adrift, fragmented into several islands and rocks of different and variable size. All these elements seem to 'float' as if by magic but all surprisingly follow the same way : there are moving off and swirling away from the center of the world. The Shadows, relics of the living beings, animals and plants, begin to appear, with the sole goal of satisfying their eternal hunger. The survivors are striking against the hopeless idea of seeing everything they know falling apart. These is only a pile of lifeless dust left from those who failed, leaving no evidence of their existence. The process is slow and has been already lasting for many years. But, among all these islands, there is one that everbody know about. The monastry island is now located at the edges of the world and still shelters some Guardians. It is now your turn. Please hurry, clock is ticking, time is running out... 'Intemporel' is a runner / plateformer in which each choice has consequences. Will you explore a field of deadly scent flowers or caves in which lives a strange character wearing a green cloak ? Select your powers and organize them before each run in order to be able to explore this ruined world and its fragmented history.",
