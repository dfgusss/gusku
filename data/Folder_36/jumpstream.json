    "About the game": "Night has fallen on gainful work as a game actor. For many, the only gig in town is Chiptunes, a dilapidated Opera House, run by a mysterious figure known only as “The Direction”. Four Coins an hour to go on camera and run through levels built in real time by the audience, if you’re lucky. If the audience is in a bad mood, it’s all spikes, monsters and pits. It’s a far cry from store shelves, but what are ya gonna do? JumpStream is a competitive platformer built in real-time by an audience, using Mixer Interactive! The goal is to work with your audience to construct an emergent path to complete challenges in the fastest possible time. Because the audience controls where your tiles are placed, there are endless strategies to use, and paths to victory! Float, Double Jump, and Roar your way through dozens of challenges using seven unique playable characters. If you’re already popular on Mixer, compete head to head against your fellow streamers for bragging rights, and if not, grab some of your friends and see who can score the best time. Each month, a new Grant Tournament opens. Put up your entry fee, choose from your team, and compete for the cash prize! -Speed Runner? Post the fastest time by adapting to an ever-changing play space! -Variety Streamer? Try and survive the best efforts of your community to stop you from completing challenges! -Emergent Gamer?
