    "About the game": "Kapital 13 is a fun casual strategy game. The game is about you owning your own company. You have to manage all the actions of the workers and yourself. Managing your inventory is also really essential. One of the many features is investing your money and many others. Kapital-13 is about building a business, where you control and balance your employees, resources, and money to make your business rise! There are 117 different items, the game is composed of 4 economic sectors to do various things to increase your income, such as crafting, mining, forestry, investing, and more! Strategy and managing are everything in this game, as you need to combine every single mechanic for the most effective way of obtaining money. To be as successful as possible you need to manage them all, managing employees is also hard as you need to take into account the money you make, and how much you can pay the employees. However, money is not everything in this game, as you also need to make sure you are hiring the right amount of employees for whatever it is you're doing, and you will need lots of planning to be successful, so here are the 4 economic sectors, and what you can do with them: The Primary Economic Sector The first economic sector is the one concerned with obtaining raw materials, such as mining and hunting. It is the most important sector because the secondary sector must work properly. However, you might not be allowed to gather materials in the best of places at the start of the game, since you first need to buy them with the money you make to access them. The things you can do in this sector are mining, which will give you gems, ores, and more raw materials, which can be used for crafting or smelting in the future. You can also forage for berries, vegetables, and other fruits while collecting wood. The fruits and berries can be used for cooking in the future, and the wood can be used for crafting or selling it. Hunting is another thing you can do in the game, and you can then cook the meat you obtain. There's also farming and livestock farming, which is good for obtaining crops and animal products, which are used to cook in the future and potentially craft. The Secondary Economic Sector This sector is about processing raw materials, which can be done by crafting. It is an extremely good way to optimize your income. In this sector you can produce energy, which is a good way to make passive income, you can also build hospitals and other buildings, which can provide various bonuses to your business. This sector also includes crafting and industry, which can be used to create items like furniture and jewelry, more complex materials, or other products. The Tertiary Economic Sector This sector contains all the services and other features such as transportation. It also includes investing, transportation is extremely important for optimizing your income even further, as depending on which world section you are in, the prices for certain products may be different. Investing can also be a good source of income, however, it is extremely risky, as you can also lose the money you invest. The Quaternary Economic Sector This sector contains scientific research, and is good for obtaining knowledge, this is the very last sector, and yet another way to increase your employee efficiency.",
