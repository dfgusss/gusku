    "About the game": "In Karryn’s Prison you play as Karryn, the new female Chief Warden of a notoriously lenient prison that has just rioted. Will Karryn subjugate the rowdy inmates through force, or will Karryn be subjugated herself as her resistance towards their nonstop sexual advances start dropping? This is a hardcore adult RPG with an unique battle system, light management aspects and a focus on gangbangs. All sex scenes take place within the battle screen. There are no visual novel style sex scenes in this game. Shape Karryn and the prison the way you want to with the Edicts system! Struggle against or accept sexual advances with the Willpower and Desire system! Become more and more vulnerable to sex with the Passives system! What Karryn’s Prison Is and Isn’t Karryn’s Prison ISN’T an eroge for the impatient or anyone who wants to come in for a quick fap in two minutes and get off and get out. All sexual activities take place inside the battle system, and Karryn will not have sex at the start of the game while she’s an inexperienced virgin who has never been touched by a man before. This is not a eroge where you can download a ‘full save’ for this game and expect to instantly access all sex scenes, or make Karryn have sex with the first guy she meets minutes into starting the game even though she’s a complete virgin with a Slut Level of 1. There’s nothing wrong with needing something easily accessible for a quick fap in a hot minute, there are many eroges in the market including our very own selection for that, but Karryn’s Prison’s aim isn’t that. Karryn’s Prison ISN’T an eroge where the female protagonist will go from zero slut to full slut in the span of one scene. Karryn’s Prison IS an eroge where the female protagonist undergoes a slow and thorough transformation of her sexual values and desires based on what happens to her. Karryn’s Prison ISN’T an eroge RPG where you mash the wait/defend skill every turn to let enemies do their sexual attacks and then expect to see sex from the start. Karryn’s Prison IS an eroge where the easiest, fastest, and most fun way to get Karryn to have sex, is to just play the game normally while you’re still learning the game. Karryn’s Prison ISN’T a game where you should come in with the mindset that you must not lose any battle. Karryn’s Prison ISN’T a game for anyone who perceives any sort of failure or setback as something that will ruin their day. Karryn’s Prison IS a game that will try to make you, the player, and also Karryn, lose and game over. Losing battles are common. Most players will most certainly reach a Bad Ending and Game Over on their first blind playthrough. Losing, and having a Game Over is expected and fun in this game. Karryn’s Prison is a hard game if you play to win, but it’s hard not because it’s unfairly unfair, but because it’s fairly unfair, if that makes sense to you. Exploring, experimenting, losing, trying again, and such are all part of the game and the learning curve. Learn and master the game’s various system and at some point the game will be so easy to you that you will begin to lose battles and get game over on purpose for specific gains, and you WILL want to lose on purpose after you’ve completely learned how the game works. Karryn’s Prison has a New Game Plus system that after you’ve reached an ending, good or bad, you will have the choice to carry over certain progress. Karryn’s Prison ISN’T an eroge where you can skip and ignore all the instructions and tips provided by the various ingame NPCs. Karryn’s Prison isn’t like any game before it with its many unique game systems, and you will be completely lost and have no fun if you don’t approach the game with the intent to learn it. Do not bring knowledge from other games before Karryn’s Prison into it. While you’re a newbie, do not purposely stall and drag battles out with wait/defend skills or otherwise play the game in an unfun or tedious way. Once you’ve began to master the game, you can then make the informed decision on whether or not to purposely stall out certain battles because at that point you understand what the expected outcome is. Karryn’s Prison IS a game that rewards time spent on it to learn the game. Karryn’s Prison IS a game that rewards experimenting and playing around the game’s various systems once you have begun to understand how they work. Although not necessary to do for most people to have fun and get their money’s worth out of the game, Karryn’s Prison IS a game that strongly rewards players who want to repeatedly reset the game through New Game Plus to try, tinker and play with different builds and choices. Karryn’s Prison IS an eroge with a lot of stats and numbers. And a lot of sex stats and records. And over four hundred potential Passives that Karryn may find herself developing. Karryn’s Prison ISN’T an eroge where the sex scenes are always the same. Karryn’s Prison IS an eroge where everything Karryn has done and have happen to her will influence the context in every battle and every sexual activity. Karryn’s Edicts, Passives, and how you direct Karryn during the battle, all provide the narrative and context before, during and after the sex. And finally, Karryn’s Prison is an eroge painstakingly crafted by two hardcore eroge lovers in an attempt to deliver a very high-quality gaming experience for players who invest their valuable time into the game. ♥ Difficulties Secretary Mode – Recommended for players who want to play the game on the lowest difficulty on their own pace and reach an ending.
