    "About the game": "This work is a free short text based Doujin adventure game, produced with passion. Game Features Beautiful CG and illustration Lovely music Dual ending A touching story about internal healing Synopsis In order to help the head of department to organize some materials, I still had to come to the school to work during the holidays. There’s none of that cool breeze of the air conditions, nor is there any loli within the school grounds. - Initially, it should just have been a normal, mundane daily stuff. Regrets that had once branded into the memories, the one that was once my obsession. I thought those had already been buried deep within me, chains, locked away. Memoires are just, memories, and they should never resurface again. Yeah, if I had not met that girl in the classroom, I would have continued on to live my life as is, till my death. Character introduction Me 'A new teacher, holds the potential for endless possibility.' - So says one of the staff materials in the education department. Kye The enigmatic loli who was wandering the deserted school grounds during the summer vacation. The feature is loli, basically a loli. Despite trying her best to be the same as others, but the act of trying to be human, as human, is already rather strange. A normal, young girl from afar, but once she starts to talk, there seems to be a something off within her. No matter how hard you look, her existence is a sheer contract to the male protagonist who reeks of danger, she might even be the symbol of peace and beauty.",
