Enemies will become progressively more difficult and numerous as you advance through the rooms. You are only given one life, so remembering enemy patterns and weaknesses will be essential for success on the next playthrough. 2 Player local Co-Op mode provides an additional challenge with expanded playing area and difficulty. You can start game with 2 players or have another player join later in safe rooms. * 13 themed rooms with unique enemies, bosses, and music * Lane based movement * Local Co-Op * Permadeath * Random level order",
