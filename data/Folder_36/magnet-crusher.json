    "About the game": "Use your magnets to control your puck and send it onto your enemies to blast them. You can either master the magnetic forces, keep your momentum and destroy any incoming threat, or fail to keep up the pace and perish. Good luck! Remember, brute strength won't help you here. Use the pulling force of the magnets to dodge, weave and gain distance until you can project yourself into the enemies and destroy them. Thankfully, you have some other tools at your disposal: special abilities that you can unlock and use regularly to help you against the waves of foes. Complete all 40 levels spread throughout 4 different worlds. Master these levels to unlock secret stages for some special rewards. Prepare to face even bigger challenges during intense boss fights. Beat all enemies one after another and resist different waves. Will you survive long enough to appear on the leaderboard among the best players of the week? And why not shoot for the all-time leaderboard? Enemies keep appearing, and they are more and more dangerous, how long can you resist? Will you be able to stay calm and focused to survive long enough to get help and powers? Do you stream on Twitch? Try our survival mode with your viewers. They can make it harder for you, but they can also help you. You will finally be able to know who deserves to be VIP (or banned). And maybe you will even be at the top of the streamer rankings? More than 40 levels Several unique bosses fight Various abilities to adapt any playstyle Appearance customization Weekly leaderboard with rewards",
