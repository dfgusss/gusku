Emerging country Willsword - Player Country Maxell - Enemy Ulcafe - Ally of Willsword Story Advances in radar technology have made stealth fighters commonplace. The Willsword country has developed the latest fighter XF -98. It is a fighter with high attack power and incredible durability. The MD armor of the fighter greatly reduced radar performance. MD armor is an armor that weakens an enemy missile by irradiating it with high-power laser and EMP. Willsword further evolved the XF -98 into the 'XF -99 Artemis'. The fighter became the ultimate invincible fighter and was feared by Maxell's pilots as a 'Air fortress'.

This game became one of the answers to that question.",
