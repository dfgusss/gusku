    "Release date": "Feb 1, 2022",
    "About the game": "MotorSim 3 is the logical evolution to a 3D game of MotorSim 2, our successful Android App which scores 4'8 stars of 5. It is a straight line car performance simulator that allows you to configure power, weight and other characteristics as you wish, so you can check how any car behaves (acceleration and top speed). Before buying: Note this is straight line racing only (no steering). What You Can Do: Set up a number of values for your car (horsepower, weight, gear rations, drag/CX coefficient an so on). Test the car (straight line only) in 3 different environments. Create races among different cars with distinct configurations. Set the camera in any place you want with respect to any car during the race. Edit car materials and colors. Edit wheels and rims (dimensions, offset, rim design, spokes count, material, color). Edit engine, turbo/supercharger, transmission and gearbox sounds. Modify some car parts. Compare your current car performance with previously recorded ghost. Share your vehicles at Cloud Garages. Learn how car acceleration physics work. Modes: Campaign Mode: gain credits and upgrade your car through 270 events. Free Mode: set up your cars and create races as you wish (drag races up to 8 cars + ghost). Important Notes: This is an Early Release game whose development is still in progress. This game is done by a single person, so please be patient. Features wishlist: Other crazy features for MotorSim 3 or for maybe a future MotorSim 4 are discussed in the Community Hub.",
