    "About the game": "Music is the Language is an original song by Dani Magnani, a Brazilian sound engineer, and musician who makes songs for films and television. This song is an upbeat funk adventure with an energetic bassline and soothing brass melodies. The sounds are overlaid over a screaming guitar that pummels the song through insane landscapes. The visuals carry you through a fantasy world full of animals and vegetation that will make you travel there. At Datawheel, we bring you original songs from new artists in unique visual experiences designed to match the mood, speed, and rhythm of every track we release. Lean into the movement.
