    "About the game": "I'm not sure if the application will go through, but I'm thinking of making this game free. Have you ever wanted to be a special power user in an anime? This is the game for you to experience it. Sword and magic VR action game! The player becomes a gladiator of the Cyberworld 'Mysterica' and fights in the arena. Swinging the sword sends a slashing wave into the air. You can chant magic by drawing a magic circle with your finger. One of the player skills in this game is the speed of magic chanting. You'll be required to make quick decisions on evasion, barriers, defensive walls, magic and slashing. The one-on-one online battle mode not only allows you to enjoy tense battles with other players, but also allows you to Endless mode and boss battles that can be played offline are also implemented. *oculus HMD in steamVR is also supported.",
