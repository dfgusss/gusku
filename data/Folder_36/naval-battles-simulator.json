    "About the game": "„Not the battleships fight, but men” Naval Admiral Józef Unrug (1884-1973) – the father of the Polish navy. Battleship or Salvo? No, it’s much more! Naval Battles Simulator is not an ordinary game: it is a tactical simulation of naval operations. NBS will throw you into the world of being a fleet commander in the most exciting battles on the water ever – the darkest times of World War II (1939-1945). NBS gives you an unpatrolled opportunity to control the actions of your fleet. With options based on real-world mechanics, you'll be able to control the fate of every single unit on the sea - from maneuvering the ship through the ammunition selection and finally to controlling your whole fleet. Features: * A multitude of battleships to choose from - feel like a real commander of a single vessel or even a whole fleet of the Second Republic of Poland, Third Reich or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland! * Enhanced tactical options - use well-known strategies to defeat your opponents or create your own ones! * Advanced game mechanics that influence the player's actions – weather based on the historical data, the artificial intelligence of the opponent or even luck can thwart your plans! * 'Shipyard' mode, which gives you an opportunity to create your own fleet based on other sides of the conflict, * The clear and legible layout, which allows for quick orientation in the heat of battle * Archival radio snippets of BBC radio broadcasts and music to get you through the conflict! * Featured story of the struggles of a Royal Navy sailor during the turmoil of war, * Infinite hours of fighting at sea! Prepare yourselves for a real sea adventure!",
