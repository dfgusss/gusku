    "About the game": "What do you do if you are the only one left aboard a spaceship? Your team has embarked on a mysterious expedition a few years ago, the ship’s machinery has started acting up and it seems there are ghosts wandering about. Luckily, the black hole above you doesn’t pose any problems…yet. Welcome aboard San-Francisco, a scientific vessel exploring the outer reaches of space. Only two crew members present – lazy board engineer Odysseus, who adores coffee and cookies and robot Barton that seems to know more than it’s willing to tell. One morning the ship’s equipment has malfunctioned, cute laboratory rats are eyeing Oddy with hunger in their sparkly eyes, and on a top of all that – the coffee has gone bad! Are you ready to dive into a delicious world of classic pixelated adventures with intelligent puzzles and a humorous, yet twisted storyline? We’re glad to welcome you aboard this scientific spacecraft. Get ready to solve dozens of satisfying scenarios, uncover the mysteries of San-Francisco, rescue your crew and get back home! Features: A pixelated adventure full of references to classic titles and a humorous, yet twisted storyline. Intelligent puzzles – say no to mindlessly combining an assortment of items and trying to guess the designer’s intent. Vast locations that can be explored in any order you like. Intuitive interface. All episodes are available on Steam.",
