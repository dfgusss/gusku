    "Release date": "Jun 11, 2020",
    "About the game": "Pluviophile is a very short experience about the mood of rain in the woods. It is a slow paced pure walking simulator; you only walk, slowly, in the wilderness away from civilization. A beautiful poem from Julius Cawein accompanies your short journey; and the original music score that is composed by Pınar Karabaş. PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood. Save progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each chapter.",
