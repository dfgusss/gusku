    "About the game": "My name is Tony Dramp. I am a simple ranger who lives from paycheck to paycheck. One day, I found a book that changed my life. I became president of Amerika! But that book turned out to be an ancient artifact and required payment for its services... Darkness enveloped my house and the forest. Now I need to get to the White House to save the country... That's my story. What do we have: -Dialogues written by the hobo hired for bottle of vodka - Unique possibility to die. Everywhere. Seriously, if you have started playing this game and are still alive you’d call FBI cause they are likely to hire you - A creepy democrat ghost will be chasing after you in the forest! Online weight loss! - Once-in-a-lifetime chance to get lost in the forest (actually not - we have a radar) - Three incredible quests for collecting three marvellous items (Oh Jesus, 10/10!) - Graphics just like in Crysis!!! (Frankly speaking not - only in case you have a really strong imagination) - Unity engine (AGAIN!) - Best soundtrack by the most famous musicians!! (well, most famous among the freemusicarchive website stuff) - Possibility to crap your pants in real life in the virtual WC - The hour of wondering through the forest in darkness!! - Bawdy humour by our stand-up comedian! We have been developing this game at off-work (and free from feeding our tame bear, of course) time! All persons in this game are fictional and any resemblence is a coincidence",
