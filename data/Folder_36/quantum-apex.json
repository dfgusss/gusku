Race through sweeping bends, tight turns, hairpins, jumps and much much more! Attack brutal race tracks with even more brutal machines, watch out for destructible obstacles that can help slow your opponents down. Each Car you buy will be totally unique to Quantum Apex, no real life brands are featured in this game. There are different tiers of car that include Street/Sports, Super, Hyper and Formula Q. Every car has a different feel to the handling and has varying performance stats, some will drift better while some will land jumps more easily. The race environments vary from earth to high orbit and even Mars! Each race track is designed around a different set of obstacles or Stunts. Different cars will be more capable on certain race tracks, with some jumps being impossible in slower cars, choosing the right car for the right track is important. There is also a chill out / play Area in the form of a car skate park, plenty of opportunity's to hone your skills and get to know your cars handling in extreme situations.
