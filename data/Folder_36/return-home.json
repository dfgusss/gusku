    "About the game": "Return Home is a abstract horizontal scrolling shooter with 2D gameplay. The game is randomised and altered dynamically according to how well you play. Shooting/destroying enemies and collecting blue chips increases your anger, reflected in the transformation of the player ship. The higher your anger the more you will score and the more difficult the game will become. Death will not normally end the game, instead your anger level is reduced and you must wait a few seconds to respawn. As you improve single bullets will turn into waves of lasers and levels will morph and change.
