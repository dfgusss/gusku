    "About the game": "This game has a relatively fast pace completion time. It's my first game put onto the store and for a cheap price too. I hope you can enjoy it for what it is. You are to go around in a spiral which has different scenarios/environments. Hence the name 'Shambled Spiral' Its design is in first person and you will be expected to acquire weapons off enemies or in allocated areas to progress. It is currently only singleplayer with 'possible' local hosting co-op in the future. I have implemented a couple of different image, sound and text triggers for a distinct immersion. The setting of the game is predominantly gloomy and medieval. There will be some difficulty, in a sense of slight puzzle solving. If you buy this version, you will have access to the new and improved version on the new and improved engine, when I can get around to do it. Don't expect anything crazy. All feedback is greatly appreciated. I wish for you to enjoy! Thank you",
