    "About the game": "The fan-favorite 2D brawler is back as ex-mob hit man Shank returns to action in Shank 2. With those closest to him under attack, Shank is once again forced on the offensive. Now he must put his trusty arsenal of handguns, shotguns, automatic weapons, chainsaws, machetes, grenades, plus all-new weaponry and moves to use in order to protect those close to him. The original game set a new standard for its visual style and Shank 2 raises the bar. Shank 2 expands on the original game’s amazing combat system to redefine the 2D side-scrolling brawler. KEY FEATURES Multi-Weapon Combat System: With a brand new redesigned weapon system, take on smarter and greater variety of goons and bigger, badder bosses with new weapon combos and new counter moves that let you use enemies’ weapons against them! It Takes More than One to Survive: Team up with a friend to put a thrashing on hordes of goons in this all-new and incredibly fun arcade-style co-op survival mode. Teamwork is essential to surviving waves of increasing tenacious enemies! Rich Environments: Look for opportunities to bring down ceilings, explode barrels, hurl crates, and explore surroundings to find new in-game unlockables! Stunning Visuals: Shank 2 draws you into the action with a stunning visual style that sets a new benchmark in 2D brawlers.",
