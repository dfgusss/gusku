    "About the game": "Silence of the Sleep is psychological horror adventure game for PC . You play as a man called Jacob Reeves. A man who has lost his reason to live. He throws himself into a blackness to end his misery, but instead of it being the end he wakes up without a memory of his life before. You will travel through the abstract world of Silence of the Sleep to find the very reason for your journey... Now that is a good question! Here are some info about Silence of the Sleep that I believe are worth knowing: Side scrolling 2D with unique, digitally drawn graphics Unique music from one end to another Minimalistic interface - I won’t hold your hand through the game Challenging puzzles No shooting - Enemy encounters are pretty rare and you can’t kill the enemies, avoid and hide from them to survive Original gameplay and twisting story - Silence of the Sleep has well crafted balance between horror and adventure, this allows me to build different atmospheres which brings variety to gameplay One man game - Graphics, animation, coding, music... You name it!",
