It is a classic 2D shooter game featuring a variety of bullet patterns that are generated continuously in a stylish black and white world. Features Minimalist and abstract art: The visual is artistically designed, based on black and white and using only rectangular-shaped elements, which offers an unique and comfortable gameplay. Variety of bullet patterns: Consisting of countless bullets, the patterns will be deployed one after another. Four unique levels: Each level is characterized by its own music and tendency of bullet patterns. Extremely simple game mechanics: No bombs. No power-ups. No items. Just dodge and shoot. Newbie friendly: You can easily recover from mistakes by destroying enemies and receiving extra lives, which lets you enjoy the game even if you aren't familiar with shmups (sorry, may not be very suitable for those who want high difficulty or who take score attacks seriously).",
