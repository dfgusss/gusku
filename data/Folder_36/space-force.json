    "About the game": "Space Force is a retro 3D side-scrolling, single - player, local, arcade, shooter game. With over 1000 waves to survive, leader boards to prove yourself to be the best, unique arsenal to tear through your enemies. (Players can use the W,S,A,D, or the arrow keys to move and the space bar or the left mouse button to shoot) The Space Force is a game that was inspired by 'Metal Slug,' 'Galaga,' and 'Hawking Raptor Call of the Shadow.' We wanted to make a game that gives off the feel like you were in the arcade playing. As of right now there is no controller support for the game 'yet,' but there will be soon. The Space Force, is a game project developed by a team of three students at Full Sail University.",
