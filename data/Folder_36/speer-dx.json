    "About the game": "Grab your speer (which is cooler than a regular spear) and puzzle-platform your way through 125 stages! Throw it into walls to create a platform, flick switches with it, or imbue it with different powers to get past lasers, portals and much more! [Speer DX] is the director's cut of the classic [Speer] and features more levels, features and additional layers of polish, making this the ultimate Speer experience! Features Turn your speer into a platform to climb walls! 125 stages filled with puzzles and platforming Place checkpoints anywhere in the level and reload instantly Stuck on a level? Skip it and come back later! Optional slow motion feature to help with tricky platforming sections Speedrun mode: Beat the game as fast as you can! Praise for the Original Game '[SPEER] from @ohsat_games is pure puzzle platforming perfection!' -Pursuing Pixels 'Dude I love Speer so much!' -Kevin Cole, developer of Haque 'A stylish retro puzzle platformer with some great level design and speer hurling gameplay that’s well worth taking a stab at.' -KJ Robertson, Alpha Beta Gamer '[...]Speer delivers some very clever puzzles. Speer [is] a game that’s often challenging but rarely frustrating. That’s a balance few games get right.' -Matthew Codd, Shindig",
