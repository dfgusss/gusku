    "About the game": "A small robot has to move around a space station, but it can't do it without receiving inputs. Help him by making him avoid obstacles that would send him to certain death. String Rush is a puzzle-platformer where you don't control your avatar in real time, but you have to enter the movement commands (input) inside a string and execute them all together. ► There are currently 26 levels available , with various types of obstacles. ► Each level has rewards if you manage to complete it with as few inputs as possible and with only one string. ► At least one hour of playtime . This is a solo project (with the exception of some assets that i purchased on unity asset store and some sfx from freesound). I'd like to make many more levels (or maybe make it endless), but this will depend on the interest in the project. In any case, thanks for visiting this page and good gaming!",
