    "About the game": "Ever wonder what it would look like if a Soviet state sponsored game developer designed a game to compete with classic side-scrollers while subverting western youth? No? Well we did. Introducing Super Marxist Twins. The evil Tsar Boarov and his army of capitalist pigs have stolen The Nation’s resources and left The People with nothing. Now it’s up to brothers Mikhail and Ludmil to collect the stolen resources and defeat Tsar Boarov once and for all. In communist paradise, money does not exist, so surrender your funds and buy Super Marxist Twins! Purchase the game for yourself! Purchase the game for your friends! Purchase the game for The Greater Good. Features: Classic side scroller platforming and action, on your own or with a friend! Collect resources to power-up the twins! Steel rivets will power-up Mikhail and his hammer-attack, while collecting wheat grains will power-up Ludmil and his mighty sickle-attack Battle an army of assorted enemies ranging from collaborator rats to heavily armed capitalist pigs. Toil away in the Industrial Forge level editor and then share the fruits of your labor with comrades across the internet. Stomp the Oppressors! Fear not comrades for you will be well equipped to carry out the revolution! Even if you find yourself with no power-ups you will be able to handle most enemies by jumping on them. Reclaim the Stolen Resources! Rivets and Wheat Grains are the primary resources that the twins use to power up. Rivets symbolize the industrial might of The Nation while Wheat grains symbolize it’s agricultural productivity. Collect Rivets to power up Mikhail’s Hammer, or to recover him if lost. Collect Wheat Grains to power up Ludmil’s Sickle attack, or to recover him if lost. Collecting a combined total of 100 Rivets and/or Wheat Grains will earn you an extra life. Having both twins will allow you to switch between which one you are controlling while the other twin follows. If you get hit while possessing both twins, the one that you had selected at the time of the attack will be lost and you will take control of the remaining twin. After a twin is active filling up the appropriate resource power meter again will enable their weapon. Weaponize your Labor! As Mikhail, collect Rivets to harness The Nation’s industrial might and throw powerful Hammers that bounce off of surfaces to kill enemies in hard-to-reach places. As Ludmil, collect wheat grains to channel The Nation’s agricultural power and throw Sickles that travel long distances to destroy enemies from a safe distance. Toast to the Revolution with a Victory Tonic! The twins’ favorite drink! Collect this item to gain temporary invincibility and plow through your enemies!
