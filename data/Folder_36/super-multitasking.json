    "About the game": "Super Multitasking is an experience like no other. Using just a single controller or keyboard and a split screen display, you will control up to 4 minigames simultaneously. Standard Mode begins with one minigame at a time and gets more difficult the longer you last. Make even one mistake and the game is over! If this seems too daunting--or not daunting enough--you can customize the difficulty of both the minigames and the multitasking independently, from Easy all the way to Maximum! Since everyone approaches multitasking differently, it's as much fun to watch as it is to play. It's great for streaming! Your viewers will be wowed by your skills, and they'll laugh at your failures! It's great at parties! Pass the controller around and find your Multitask King! Share Super Multitasking with your friends, and watch as they excel...or don't! Next, you can take on Challenge Mode! It features 42 scripted Challenges that start off easy, but get tougher and tougher! You'll spend hours figuring out the best ways to navigate, attack, and finally conquer them! Can you get through all of them without breaking your controller? Try Speedrun Challenge Mode, which has you racing the clock to clear them all in one go! Support for Steam Leaderboards will have you racing other players as well! Want to set up your own scenarios, either for practice or for amusement? There's a full-featured Practice Mode that allows you to set up the minigames any way you like! You can design your own challenges, work on a particular weakness, or torture your friends! Plus: Built-in tournament support for up to 24 players Support for over 100 unique Steam Leaderboards Challenge yourself to unlock 33 Steam Achievements Five Bonus Modes offer even more ways to enjoy the unique experience Unlock your hidden potential, and enjoy hours of thrills alone or with friends, in Super Multitasking!",
