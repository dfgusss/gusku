    "About the game": "Survival Games is a Battle Royale survival shooter set in an ever-changing world full of secrets, traps, wildlife and treasure. Never play the same game twice, with our unique game maps that dynamically change with every new round you play. Survival Games contains three additional modes, making this a diverse Survival Experience. Work together in Zombie Survival, or against each other in the Arena Shooter. Powered by the Hazzah Engine, a powerful rendering and terrain engine built from the ground up to support the next generation of voxel games. Features ▶ Dynamic Map Points of Interest change every time you play. The perfect blend of procedural generation of intelligent map design. ▶ Battle Royale Mode Drop from the sky into the wilderness as an ever-shrinking dome pushes you into constant conflict. Available from launch. ▶ Zombie Survival Work together and survive on the loot you find in the ruins of City 26 as hordes of undead stalk you day and night. Now available in game. ▶ Arena Shooter Mode Classic free for all, or team-based FPS action with respawns. Now available in game. ▶ Map Editor Create maps for any of the above game types, and upload them to the Steam Workshop, with your friends online. Coming soon ▶ Guns, Melee and Throwable Guns, swords and thrown weapons make for deep combat not limited to just twitch reaction shoot outs. Power attacks, blocking and stamina add so much more. ▶ Hunger and Stats Sprinting uses up stamina, food prevents starvation and sleep is needed each night. Fail to look after yourself, and exhaustion will kill you before your enemies do! ▶ 4k resolution ▶ Crafting ▶ Destructible Terrain ▶ Player Customisation ▶ Perks ▶ Hats and Accessories ▶ Custom Music Tracks",
