A magic helmet allows the player to swing through all of the affected dimensions, and set things right by ringing all the resonator bells. A colossus robot stand between you and the final bell. Explore a colorful cartoon world by swinging through enchanted deserts, bright forests, steep canyons, and many more bizarre and beautiful worlds!
