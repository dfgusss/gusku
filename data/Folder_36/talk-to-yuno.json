    "About the game": "Yuno has been interested in the occult since a young age. However, most of her attempts so far failed to produce any results. Spells had little effect, predictions were hit and miss.... Armed with a new crystal ball and a book about summoning, Yuno decided to double her efforts. 'This time, it will work!' 'I will finally establish a connection with a different dimension.' After patiently waiting for the planets to align, drawing an elaborate magic circle and chanting the right incantation... She finally managed to summon...... YOU! ～New Features～ In addition to the usual keyword and greeting systems found in the Talk to... line: Help Yuno Solve Cases: The reason why Yuno summoned you in the first place is because she wants to ask for advice. Keyword Preview: Keyword suggestions appear as you type! This makes it easier to find topics to talk about. Unexpected Visitors: Aya and Saki might show some interest in the supernatural. ～Play a little bit every day～ Some cases develop over time. You and Yuno might both think that you solved someone's problem... but then things take an unexpected turn. ※Note: No need to worry about saving! Player's name and progress are saved automatically.",
