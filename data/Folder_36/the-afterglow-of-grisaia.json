    "About the game": "The Afterglow of Grisaia was originally released in Japan as a first-edition bonus for volume 5 of the Eden of Grisaia anime adaptation Blu-ray/DVD. We're excited to release it as a standalone product for the first time, fully localized for western fans to enjoy! The Afterglow of Grisaia takes the form of a side story to The Labyrinth of Grisaia (the second main series Grisaia game, also recently released in English!). The game is a story-driven visual novel with serious overtones. The Labyrinth of Grisaia shed some light on Kazami Yuuji's past, offering a deeper look at events stretching as far back as his birth. This story, however, concerns Yuuji's experiences with Kusakabe Asako, the CIRS agent who rescued him at a young age from a terrorist organization. Secret passages of The Labyrinth of Grisaia are revealed within... It is recommended that you play this game only after having played The Labyrinth of Grisaia.",
