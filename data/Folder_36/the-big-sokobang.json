    "About the game": "SokoBang ('The Big SokoBang') is a brain trainer game for people who enjoy intellectual challenges. The game helps developing logical aptitude to solving problems and strategic thinking. Sokobang enables the player to progress through the levels in different ways depending on his or her choice. Though different, all levels gradually increase in the difficulty. The game is based on the classic Sokoban - featuring a host of new elements. The name Big Sokobang comes from the idea that there is an explosion of new game features and elements enhancing the classic. All levels are unique and individually designed. Various optional opportunities are available upon request - for example, best-turn suggestion (hint) and bonus unlocking levels. Each level is an exciting puzzle. Intelligent UI and player control: Click anywhere on the screen and your player will move there instantly using a shortest path algorithm. No need to repeatedly click or swipe to move your player around. Swipe Box and the character will move it, if possible, without moving other boxes.",
