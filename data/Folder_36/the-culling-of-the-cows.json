    "About the game": "The Culling Of The Cows is a side-scrolling shooter / tower defence game. You will take the role of Sammy, a soliloquizing schizophrenic farmer with a self prophesied mission to lay waste to the disease spreading over his farm. With his dusty old 12 gauge at his side and god at his back, Sammy isn’t going to be taking too kindly to the infectious chaos of the big city’s leaking its way out into wild country. When all the lunacy started Sammy consulted God on what he should do, and the response was. KILL THEM! KILL THEM ALL!!!! Steam Big Picture Features: Full Controller support. Steam Achievements. Fast paced action mixed with strategic gameplay. 40 levels of critters that need a good butchering. Cheat Console. Plough your way through herds of shamblers and ravenous cattle. Easy to pick up and play, but gets quite challenging.",
