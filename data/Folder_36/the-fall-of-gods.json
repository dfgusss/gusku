    "About the game": "Old-school Action-RPG. The fall of gods is an indie game humbly inspired by Action-RPG you used to play on 16-bit consoles (zelda, the secret of mana, alundra...) It was played by more than 75’000 gamers on PC and Xbox so far ...The gods and their Magic are gone long ago, and everything was left but a prophecy : “From the Darkness shall rise the Light, From the Light shall rise the Darkness”. Since then, every 16 years old boy has to challenge the 'Sanctuary', as it’s said that Magic will be back with the One who would defeat its Beast. Your hero will take part in the prophecy and find the true meaning of the 'Fall of Gods', the story about the Genesis of the World, and perhaps, more about his lost mother. The Fall of Gods is a traditional indie old-school action-RPG, where you could revive your favourite 16bit titles, but with more magic, and orchestral pieces of music. If you like to defeat dungeons, collect &amp; swap items, fight with different weapons, cast spells, wear armours, rafting, hidden spots, puzzles, drive balloon, brew potions, side-quests, fairy fountains, a sense of irony, and of course, if you like to save the World? Then you will like The fall of gods",
