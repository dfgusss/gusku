    "About the game": "Five hunters have tracked the beast and failed. Now it's YOUR turn! YOU are a hunter; a man or woman of wealth and leisure who has turned their time to hunting the fiendish monsters that assail humanity. One such horror is plaguing the city of Harrow's Gate. The last five hunters to search for it have all gone missing. You must find them and lay the monster low! A choose your own adventure novel in which your choices and actions can lead you to glorious victory...or ignoble defeat. Explore an original story with three challenging game difficulties, unlock hidden lore to better understand the world you enter, and enjoy the artwork you discover in the gallery. This independently produced novel features a dark soundtrack (with optional atmospherics) by Cryo Chamber, as well as over 40 unique page images to unlock. The text of the game has also been recorded by a professional musician and story-teller, making it into an interactive audiobook. Featuring no battle-royale shenanigans and produced without 100-hour work weeks, Vile Philosophy is an old-fashioned, spine-chilling steampunk tale you can enjoy time and time again.",
