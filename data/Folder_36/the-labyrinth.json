    "About the game": "The Labyrinth is a text-based dungeon crawler with an emphasis on combat and looting. Take a party of 4 heroes on a quest to purge an underground dungeon of a great evil lurking within. The dungeon is filled with both spirits and monsters that will either help you on your journey or attempt to stop you in your tracks! Features 16 playable class types each with an assortment of 9 unique abilities. 40 enemy class types with their own 9 unique abilities. 20+ room types that either help or hinder your quest. Run length settings allow you to finish the game in either a single sitting or multiple. Seeded randomness allows you to play the same run as many times as you want. 50 achievements, over 100 statistics, and cloud saves. Loot your way through a procedural dungeon. The floors generate endlessly, and with many room types there's plenty of fresh encounters as you delve deeper into the dungeon. Use tactics to fight hoards of enemies. The enemies are smart and work together in their attempt to defeat you. Use your party's many abilities to synergize with each other to gain the upper hand. Bosses pose an even greater threat and will need you to keep sharp attention on their spells and items so you come to no encounter unprepared. Encounter beings that can help, or slow you down, along your path. Sacrificial chambers grant rewards for risking your life or coin, shops contain rare items and consumables, enchanted anvils allow you to create items, cursed rooms debilitate your party, or empower your enemies, during your next combat encounter, and many more interactions through the many room types.",
