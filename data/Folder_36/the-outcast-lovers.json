    "About the game": "Play the Prequel: / A SHORT GAME BY DE FAULT &amp; CHARD Foreigners reported to the authorities have a nasty habit of being 'disappeared' by the vigilante English Protection Group. You're outcasts, living a private life miles from others already. When faced with someone desperate and alone, someone you're in a position to help, is it your responsibility to? This is a single, film-like scene. You control the actions of Ola, a retired political cartoonist, as well as directing the camera shots between the cinematic angles available. The second of twelve small, experimental narrative games to be released monthly. FEATURES Struggle with a timely political dilemma. Choose your own: what does your decision say about you? Direct the camera to shoot the story your way. Lose yourself in surreal colours. Enjoy a moving score with arrangements of 90’s classics b​y Ricky Z. A tight, intense 10 minutes.",
