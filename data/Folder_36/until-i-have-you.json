    "About the game": "Until I Have You , is a story-driven, fast-paced, retro-aesthetic platformer, engulfed in a Cyberpunk setting. Driving you to the edge of your seat as you run n' gun through enemies, the game recounts a thrilling story of regret, love and corruption, in a city that’s gone haywire and just doesn't give a damn. This is the story of the ARTIST , a talented assassin, who has worked many dirty jobs in a long and successful career. Finally heeding the pleadings of his wife, he has decided it's time to quit this ugly business and live a simple and peaceful life. However the ARTIST’s clients know he is irreplaceable, and are unwilling to allow the craftsman to hangup his tool belt. They send him this message by kidnapping his wife, Emily, and make it clear, retirement is not an option! The ARTIST is determined to get his wife back, and prepares himself for one last assignment. He understands to be successful he needs to go all out, and he procures a rare exoskeleton suit. Although this provides him with additional powers, it also can cause hallucinations and affect his judgment. If you could save someone, how much of yourself would you be willing to sacrifice? Features: 12 Chapters of immersive story-telling Beautifully pixelated environments Fast paced action Over 60 unique Enemies and 12 Boss Fights. Rich and Diverse Settings (both in gameplay mechanisms and visuals) Fully Voiced Dialogues Gritty Cyberpunk Atmosphere Keyboard &amp; Controller Support",
