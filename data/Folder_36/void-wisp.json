    "About the game": "Void Wisp is a runner where avoiding obstacles isn’t enough. You only gain points by coming close to them. The closer you get, the more point you will earn. Play to safely and you will lose points. Features: Simple gameplay that’s easy to pick up and hard to master. Designed for both short spurts and long sessions. 4 Game Modes each with a unique twist. In Classic Mode you’ll start to lose points the farther you go, so you want to get as many as quickly as possible. In Caravan Mode you have one minute to score as much as possible. Crashing will lower the amount of time you have. Survival Mode is the most complex mode. A timer is always ticking down but can be refilled by collecting luster and having a high multiplier. The game gets faster and you earn more points the further you make it. In Traveler Mode there are 40 premade levels each with 5 goals to complete. You will face unique obstacles not found in the other modes. Accessibility options that let you customize the game’s looks, controls, and difficulty. You can change the appearance of the game and character to better suit what makes you comfortable. Supports mouse, keyboard, and gamepad. All with fully remappable controls! Dreamy ambient music that partially reacts to how you play.",
