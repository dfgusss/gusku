    "About the game": "Say howdy to West of Loathing -- a single-player slapstick comedy adventure role-playing game set in the wild west of the Kingdom of Loathing universe. Traverse snake-infested gulches, punch skeletons wearing cowboy hats, grapple with demon cows, and investigate a wide variety of disgusting spittoons. Talk your way out of trouble as a silver-tongued Snake Oiler, plumb the refried mysteries of the cosmos as a wise and subtle Beanslinger, or let your fists do the talking as a fierce Cow Puncher. Explore a vast open world and encounter a colorful cast of characters, some of whom are good, many of whom are bad, and a few of whom are ugly. Features: a sprawling open world, chock full of danger, quests, puzzles, and mysteries lush hand-drawn black and white graphics full stick-figure customization thousands of jokes, gags, and goofs crunchy turn-based combat (but only if you want it) liberal use of the Oxford comma over 50 hats disreputable saloons several gulches a drunk horse NOTE: characters are not literally colorful (the game is in black and white)",
