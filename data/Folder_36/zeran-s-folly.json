    "About the game": "Zeran's Folly is a story-driven action-adventure with fluid melee combat, four unique playable characters, and a twisted sense of humor. Follow the adventures of Lone as he scours the land for the artifacts that will do... something. In the end, Lone will have to choose between abandoning either his friends or everything he's worked for. What would you choose? Content Warning This game contains crude/suggestive dialogue and some nudity of both sexes. Cool Stuff Switch instantly between up to seven unique playable characters anywhere in the world, each with their own abilities Each character has multiple talents that can change their abilities and playstyle Mountains of rings to find and equip that have effects from increasing money drops to changing attacks Look your best with piles of alternate outfits for each character Seven huge dungeons to conquer Restart a new game with all your stuff by reliving your memories (New Game +). Never lose progress from dying--just revive at the last Whisper Stone save point. Extend your survivability with your trusty Hip Flask, an upgradeable health potion. Rich and touching story, although it's more like a bad touch Absolutely stunning art that's a feast for the eyes and possibly genitals Fully supports and provides extra gameplay features for gamepads/controllers A catchy soundtrack that bounces from island beats to cool country to headbanging metal Over ten hours of gameplay on average Other Stuff Made with SFML",
