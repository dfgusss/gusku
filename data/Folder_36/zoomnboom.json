    "About the game": "ZOOMnBOOM is a game about driving really fast and exploding. Survive for as long as you can without crashing into the light trails left by you and your opponents! Your speed is ever-increasing, so collect orbs to slow down if things get too fast! And be careful with those brakes; if they overheat, you'll explode! These vehicles definitely don't adhere to governmental safety regulations! Features include: - Two gravity-defying arenas! - Split-screen with up to four players! - Simple pick-up-and-play controls! - Bots to battle against if you don't have friends around! - Bots to battle against if you do have friends around but they're busy doing other stuff! - Bots to battle against if you just don't have any friends! - But the bots can't really do anything except play this game almost competently, so don't get too attached! They won't go to the movies with you!",
