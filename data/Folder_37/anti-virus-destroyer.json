    "About the game": "Anti: Virus Destroyer is a fast-paced, single-player 3D platform shooter. As Anti, your sole goal is to bring ruin to every virus in sight, defending your country from digital intrusions. You play as a new kind of antivirus designed with the capabilities to adapt to any conceivable situation, effectively being the first semi-artificial intelligence. Move, jump, and shoot viruses to clear each level, manipulate switches to alter the environment around you, and grab checkpoints to temporarily save your progress in case you are destroyed. More enemies and obstacles will appear to challenge your goal of ultimate virus destruction. Clear all of the systems and purge the virus threat!",
