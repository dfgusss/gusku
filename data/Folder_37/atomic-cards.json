    "About the game": "Atomic Cards is an RPG card game in a post-apocalyptic world set where your money no longer has any value. A far more important goal is to obtain food, resources and weapons that will allow you to live a year in a new world devoid of morality and compassion. You will be faced with difficult life choices that affect how 'society' will treat you. Will you be able to remain human in this hell reigning on Earth? CREATE YOUR CHARACTER Choose a ready-made character with the characteristics that suit you or create your own. UNIQUE CARD COMBAT SYSTEM The use of weapons, armor, healing and perks is based on the principle of the card deck. CREATE A SHELTER To survive the cold nights of post-apocalypse EXPLORING THE WORLD Will reward you with various events. PROCEDURAL WOLRD The generation of events, locations for exploration and events with a moral choice occur randomly with an accumulation of difficulty. DARK ATMOSPHERE EXCITES YOUR MIND Every time you face a choice, you consciously follow the path of those moral values that you have chosen. By playing Atomic Cards, you can show your worst sides and experience all the delights of the vicious world of post-apocalypse.",
