    "About the game": "Please note that this game is still very much being developed. We need a great number of players to be able to try all the things we aim to do and we also look for your input into how to make this into a great party game. Aviators is a fast paced, highly competitive, party game, played online in teams with up to 4 players a side. Crash and be crashed as you battle for the highest score before the time runs out. Challenge other teams of Aviators online in this chaotic and entertaining game. No fancy power ups, just steering skills and timing. You have a limited amount of lives and there’s a clock on each round so use them both wisely. Securing points under cover from your team mates or making the ultimate sacrifice for the greater good of your team, what role will you play? Grab some controllers (highly recommended), call your (at least for now) friends and take to the skies - This is Aviators!",
