    "About the game": "Beach Ball Valley is a relaxing, playful world, complete with pizza paddles. Roll around in a flock of beach balls, send 'em soaring over the hills, let them rain down on you, or pop them all! Everyone can enjoy VR in Beach Ball Valley - younger folk, older folk, or anyone who wants a vacation from dodging lasers and swinging swords. There are three easy-to-understand minigames - with no way to lose, but a very high score cap if you want to challenge your friends. Or, mix things with zero gravity, becoming a giant, or piloting beach balls with your mind. Beach Ball Valley is a great way to introduce people to VR. Tap keys on your keyboard to highlight buttons inside the game, start those minigames, or swarm friends with dozens of beach balls. 'This is more fun than a room full of puppies' Business Executive 'Weirdly fun' Steam Reviewer This game gave me a squeaky trigger :( Dont spawn too much beach balls kids. Serious Beach Baller Note to serious beach ballers: we've really dialed in the weight, gravity, flight spin dynamics, controller haptics and mind-control interactions to ensure things feel great. These may be the most advanced beach balls ever simulated in VR.",
