The council, knowing that his people did not have many choices, decided to appeal to ancient magic in order to open portals to other dimensions, there, they made another great discovery, they identified crystals that possessed a lot of energy inside and they have brought back to their kingdom. After a few days the crystals began to send large waves of energy, trees and pastures began to grow where they no longer grew, all started coming back to life. Unfortunately the ancestors portals were also affected by the crystals and terrible monsters began to appear from them, the sages of the council, with their extraordinary abilities, tried to close the portals however, every attempt was followed by failure. One of the brave warriors of their dimension found a way to stop the monsters and eventually close the portals to bring peace to the kingdom of Cubia.
