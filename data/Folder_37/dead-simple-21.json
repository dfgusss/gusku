    "About the game": "Death comes to us all . . . Sometimes he just wants to play cards! HEAD TO HEAD WITH DEATH HIMSELF Death likes nothing more than having a quick game of 21. Its his favourite hobby (apart from knitting!). However, he hates losing! FAST PACED 21 Simply try and make 21 in any one of the four lanes available. Make 21 and Death gets annoyed! Get combinations of 21 in a row and max out the multiplier to extend your timer (life). Keep playing through the rounds and you'll be rewarded with special cards that may help or hinder your progress. ACHIEVEMENTS GALORE! Theres lots to aim for in the game along with all the achievements you'll want to unlock. Can you make a '5 card trick'? Will you quit on Death (do you dare?) or will you find out what Ghost Bustin' is? SPECIAL CARDS It would be a boring game of 21 if there weren't any Special Cards to play with and Death has supplied us with some of his best - 'The Blind Mans Curse', 'Heart Stopper' &amp; 'Lane Bomber' to name just a few. Some will help and some will hinder your progress. Death enjoys it when you receive a nasty card. Dead Simple 21 is simple to learn and easy to play. Its suitable for everyone and also has 3 different game modes to try your hand at.",
