    "About the game": "Defense Grid 2, DG2, is the sequel to Hidden Path Entertainment’s 2008 Defense Grid: The Awakening. Setting the bar as the definitive tower defense game, Defense Grid 2 introduces new worlds and threats to test your tower placement strategies. With a bold new look, a compelling single-player campaign, and the addition of new game modes, online player-versus-player and multiplayer co-op, every play-through brings fun new opportunities and challenges. DG2 comes with a story campaign featuring 21 stunning maps, dynamic level movement, an expanded story and cast of characters, hundreds of challenge mode experiences, new multiplayer modes, a procedurally driven audio score and the ability for players to build their own levels. DG2 also introduces players to DG Architect on the PC, a level creation tool set connected to Steam Workshop where players can create their own unique levels to share and possibly even sell if selected. The Steam Special Edition includes additional content around the DG2 in-game and behind-the-scenes stories. If you purchase or upgrade to the Special Edition you will receive: - A Matter of Endurance: a 30 minute flash-based audio play that runs on your PC featuring character voices and concept art from a new original story by Hugo award author Mary Robinette Kowal, that takes place between the events of Defense Grid: Containment and Defense Grid 2, - A 312 page PDF of the book 'The Making of Defense Grid 2: The complete story behind the game' by Russ Pitts, a reporter and author embedded with the development team during the full development cycle of the game, - A 73 page PDF of the art book: The Art of Defense Grid, showing concept art during the development of the original Defense Grid, and - a 123 page PDF of the art book: The Art of Defense Grid 2, showing concept art developed during the development of Defense Grid 2. DG2 for the PC was funded in part by Dracogen, a private investor after a 2012 Kickstarter campaign funded the original game's DLC, Defense Grid: Containment. DG2 is developed by Hidden Path Entertainment and published by 505 Games.",
