    "About the game": "Dogs and Pigs is a hacking/adventure/rpg game to hack a company. You play as a boy who once played hard at their games, who is dissatisfied with the big game companies in Korea. You put the things you need to hack the company into your cell phone and USB and apply for the company's tour program. You have to find false facts such as odds manipulation that are different from what is actually known in the company's game and inform the world. You've been playing the game for a long time, so you're almost certain that there's some odds manipulation in the game. “Dogs and pigs” is a word that immediately shows how Korean game companies treat their customers. You, who have played Korean mmorpg for a long time, are outraged by the attitude of the game company that created the Korean mmorpg towards users, and you decide to hack the computer of the famous game company NNN for revenge. You decide to go directly to the company and plug in the USB containing the virus for the most reliable hacking. Can you get out of there without leaving any evidence? Also, can you escape after hacking the company's computer? STORY LINE Enter the company: When you enter the office, disable the security camera while the employees are not watching, and plug the USB containing the virus into the computer in the office to prepare for hacking. All the tools to disable security cameras are on your phone. Start hacking at home: You return home and hack into the game operator's PC infected with a virus to enter the game. In it, you check the source code, find and copy a file containing data that is different from the probability that the game company falsely announced. The ending of the game depends on which files you have copied. Gets out of the company's computer.: After you find the files you need, you try to get out of there. Along the way, you'll meet the person you've been wanting to meet and share your experiences and your dissatisfaction with them. The last thing you need to do is turn off the security program and then finally get out of there.",
