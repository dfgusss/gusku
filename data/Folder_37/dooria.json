    "About the game": "This challenging puzzler immerses you in a strange world - and it’s up to you to figure out how it all works. There is no guidance. No hand holding. It’s an unusual and somewhat experimental game, that doesn't behave as you might expect. At its core it’s just atmosphere and puzzles. If that's what you fancy, then you're all set, but there are elements that give it an extra layer - a bonus for those who like to dig deeper. The puzzles themselves share some common principles, yet each has its own rules. There is a trial and error aspect to all of it, threaded with logic and three-dimensional thinking, and the rules are best discovered at a slow, methodical pace. There’s no rush, slow down, take your time, and enjoy the process. It's a personal piece. Though its features make it accessible to everyone, it will probably draw a very specific audience. Not sure that’s you? Please visit the game site to learn a bit more. For further information, feel free to join the Dooria Discord channel and ask your questions.",
