Instructions You gain abilities as you progress through the story Pressing the same key/button as you use for Jump advances you through the Dialog The longer you hold the jump key/button the higher DreamDasher will jump To reach the highest heights, first jump and then dash when in the air.

This consists of pressing the jump key/button when you are on the wall and at the same time pressing the joystick/key in the oppositive direction of the wall you are jumping off of. DashAttack and Gravity can only be performed once between touching the ground. There are indicators showing if DreamDasher has its DashAttack and/or Gravity available.  If DashAttack is availble you will see an Orange glow around DreamDasher.  If Gravity change is available, you will see Orange vapors coming out of the top of DreamDasher. These will disappear when you've consumed your DashAttack and/or Gravity change while in the air until you touch the ground again. Dash is your attack when needed Press the joystick/controls against a wall to slowly slide down the wall. While wall sliding, you can also press the joystick or key in the down direction of DreamDasher while on the wall to slide faster down the wall. Adjust difficulty level or turn on Difficulty Modifiers if you need help progressing through story  ( in turning on Difficulty Modifiers some achievements may not be obtainable ) Hints Towards the end of the game Nightmare has two types of laser attacks. The first is a sweeping laser, and you can Dash through the sweeping laser unharmed. The second is a tracking laser that tracks DreamDashers movement, and it charges over a couple of seconds and then fires. The tracking laser can be avoided by hiding behind objects when it is about to fire. When trying to find all of the Crystals, look for secret passage ways (they will look different) when in the Blue level/rooms.
