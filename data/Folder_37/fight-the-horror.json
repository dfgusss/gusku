    "About the game": "Fight the Horror: A multiplayer, heart-thumping, survival horror role-playing thriller game that you can’t miss! Dizzy and stumbling, you are corralled into a pitch-black room with other people. You recognize a few of them, but you are not sure. They sit in the room, distant and detached. A screen flickers to life and a strange, illusory story starts and enrapture you and your fellow captives. One and all hold on their breath… Suddenly, you find yourself in the middle of a city you seem to remember from your past. Something isn’t right. To survive in this strange timeline and have a chance to escape, you have to solve all puzzles and defeat the insidious boss lurking behind all this! The situation is dire and dangerous, but you are no longer alone! Game features: Online multiplayer mode for nine players: Three people work in a team and three teams total will compete against each other. A suspense game based on real stories: Adapted from seven historical events in Macao with various endings depending on player’s choices. Diversified gameplay: To solve suspenseful puzzles, kill powerful monsters, and survive suspicious mechanisms. Unique worship and burial system: death is not the end, but the beginning of another chapter. From the Producer: If I can own only one game in my life, I’ll choose Fight the Horror. Time and again, I often wonder if the Twisted World exists, and I am trapped there permanently with no escape. I wouldn’t meet Death nor would I feel hungry. Besides, I would have all the time in the world with me, and my friends would be in the Twisted World as well. If I could bring only one game with me, which one would it be? I think if I brought one, it would have to be a horror game. My friends would be there, but I wouldn’t necessarily want them to watch me play. Just like I wouldn’t want to stand there and watch them play. I hope we could feel the thrill and excitement in the game together, but the game has to be uber scary even though I play with my friends. Smacking zombies could be boring, so I would delight in suspenseful plots. I also love a game that leaves us some room to reflect and review. Furthermore, I like to move around when I play a game. To me, a game has to be more than just mashing the mouse, opening the door, even watching an ad… I crave for fascinating upgrades and elements for collection in the game, but I do not necessarily want to pay extra for things all the time. I want to earn them. I hope this is a game that will continue on for a long time. I hope this is a game that can bring us lots of fun no matter when we play it. It’s a shame that I haven’t found a game like that, so I hope for the time being, the Twisted World wouldn’t happen to me, yet. When Fight the Horror is out, I will bring this game to there, and make it my paradise!",
