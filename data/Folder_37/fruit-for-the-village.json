    "About the game": "From the creators of Light Repair Team #4 , Fruit for the Village is a game set in the future, in a world torn apart by climate change and war. Out in the desert, small villages struggle to survive in the harsh environment. These villages work towards creating a normal way of life, or at least finding a new place they can call home. Follow the story of one of these ordinary villages. Discover the history of the village, its people and your role in this newly devastated world. Be careful though! The villages food supply continually runs and prices rise with each purchase! You'll build a thriving garden to feed a starving village in this narrative VR game about a small village, and the fruit you're growing to ensure its survival. Be careful though! The villages food supply continually decreases and item prices rise with each purchase! Use harvested fruit to enhance your gardens bounty by buying larger plots and auto-growers to grow fruit for you. Optimize your gardens production to be able to continually send more food to refill the villages supply! Features ▲ Story mode Build and optimize your garden to adapt to the ever changing story of the village. Includes a NewGame+ mode. ▲ Survival Mode Focus on your optimization skills, providing sustenance to the village for as long as you can. ▲ Multi-platform support Fruit for the village supports both HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, right out of the box! Standing scale too!",
