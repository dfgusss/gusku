Determined to save their families, a group of children boards a giant tank and begins an offensive charge! Fuga: Melodies of Steel is an RPG where you place children, each with their own unique characteristics and skills, at different gun turrets in a tank to fight against the enemy. Living inside the tank, the children show emotion and gain affinity amongst each other. Manage these both to change the outcome of their journey! -A mysterious ancient weapon: The Taranis Taranis, the giant tank sheltering the children, conceals many mysteries and somehow seems to have its own will. In situations of crisis, it can release a forbidden weapon, the dreadful Soul Cannon. -Your adventure. Your choices. Will you make sacrifices for victory? Or will you seek another path? In this RPG, many choices have to be made in order to progress... but taking the safest road may not always be the best option.
