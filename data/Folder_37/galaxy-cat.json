    "About the game": "Play as Coz the Cosmic Kitten as you travel the solar system reconnecting the universe together. The ancient guardian of the Milky Way, known as the Galaxy Cat, will sometimes sleep for millennia. During one of their catnaps, a massive meteor tore through a solar system, leaving it in ruins and breaking the bonds that hold the various Sectors together. Upon waking and realizing their mistake, the Galaxy Cat repaired the planets, but they were too large to collect the scattered energy that powered the portals between the Sectors. So, they created the Cosmic Kitten, a being composed of stardust and energy, to travel the solar system and restart the portals. Play through 50+ single-screen platforming challenges, collecting energy fragments along the way.",
