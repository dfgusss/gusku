Classes, stealing, playing video games, growing savagely. The rebellious and unruly personality made Wang Han a stranger in the eyes of his peers, and a bad child in the eyes of teachers and adults, but all the surrounding rejection of him did not prompt Wang Han to change his mind, but pushed him on the opposite path. So Wang Han began to mess around with bad young people in the society. The growing hormones made his words and deeds more and more extreme. It was not until he witnessed a shooting that Wang Han realized that he had fallen into the abyss of evil. Game features:： The background of the game was set in the 1990s during the layoff wave.
