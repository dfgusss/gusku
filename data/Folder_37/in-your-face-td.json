    "About the game": "In Your Face TD is a Tower Defense, which utilises room scale VR to give a new dimension to a classic genre. You find yourself on a lonely space station, with only the mining drones to keep you company. Luckily the drones are hard workers, and they will gather resources so you can build defenses against invading creatures from another dimension. These creatures are vicious, but they aren’t the brightest. They have one goal in mind, and that is destroying your base. Smart as you are, you build a maze and lure the stupid creatures around and through your defences, before they can reach the base. Knowing that space stations are regularly attacked by waves of evil, you've also brought your laser guns, bombs and even sawblade frisbees. Features include: Take advantage of the level design to build an optimal maze of towers and lure the enemies around your defences. Take on the enemies face-to-face with three different weapons: Shotgun, laser minigun and sawblade frisbee. Throw bombs at the enemies from the top of your towers. Unlock upgrades based on your performance. Upgrades include chain-lightning, exploding sawblade frisbees, flying robot bombs and more. Maximize your income by building mining drones. Master the game on four difficulties ranging from Easy to Insane.",
