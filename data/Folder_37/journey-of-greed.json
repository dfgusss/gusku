You play as a pirate... adventurer in the Age of Discovery, heading into the lost islands along side three other adventurers. As you dive deeper and deeper into the adventure, things become more dangerous and enticing, only the bravest and smartest can take the treasure out alive. You'll make many different hard choices during the adventure: Continue for more or escape with what you have? Co-operate with other players or stabs them in the back? Prepare for the incoming danger or risk for more reward? You'll find your answers in the Journey of Greed.
