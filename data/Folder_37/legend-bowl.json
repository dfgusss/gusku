Sim-based controls with challenging gameplay mechanics bring the fight to your doorstep!

Here you can pick up and play against the computer or a friend to see who can beat each other and get all the bragging rights! FRANCHISE MODE Select your favorite team and play through an infinite number of seasons to see if you can win the Legend Bowl! You'll start off by selecting your favorite team and creating your very own coach or choose from an existing coach from the league. From there you'll play a full 17 week schedule, complete with player wire events, player and team stats, weekly wrap up news, and more to keep you engaged along the way. Player traits are a major factor in how they play each week and you'll have to manage the chemistry of your team to keep you in the winner's circle. There's also a complete off season where you'll take your team through retirements, free agency, player progression, and a full 7 round draft. The goal is to have a deep and immersive Franchise mode where you can have endless hours of fun and challenge! TOURNAMENT MODE Take your team through a bracket style tournament tree to see if you can become a legendary squad! There are 16 teams in total and you must beat your bracket each week to get to the final championship game. Do you have what it takes to win it all? TRAINING CAMP MODE Take on special drills to earn unlockable items and practice until your thumbs get sore! This mode is a sandbox where you can hone in on your skills and practice plays with your favorite teams. CUSTOMIZATIONS Are you the creative type? Well look no further! In Legend Bowl, you'll be able to fully customize players, coaches, and teams to recreate your very own league. Choose from a variety of hairstyles, faces, visors, earrings, hats, headbands, gloves, and more to build as unique of a roster as you can dream up. This is one of the main pillars of our game and we can't wait to see what the community brings to the table! REALISTIC WEATHER Weather is key to any football game, so why not in Legend Bowl? Play in clear, cloudy, rain, and snow types of weather. Be careful not to get struck by lightning! There's also a Day time cycle lighting system so you can feel the heat on the field. PRESENTATION On the field stat overlays, halftime stats, end of game stats, field art, live referees, chain gang, mascots, advertisements, fans and more get you immersed in the game and bring the action to your screen! HYBRID ARCADE &amp; SIM-STYLE FOOTBALL ACTION Travel to the golden era of sports games when you had fun mixed with realistic gameplay. Customize your rosters and build a legendary team using speed, agility, acceleration, and more to battle your way through the gridiron!

A unique throwing mechanic allows you to control the ball and give your receivers the best chance to catch the ball! RETRO PIXELATED GRAPHICS Experience timeless pixelated graphics and fully customizable player faces, hair, helmets, hats, visors, facial hair, equipment, and more! The customization options are endless and make for a unique artstyle! RETRO CHIPTUNE SOUNDTRACK Listen to classic chiptune music that make you feel like you're back in the arcade with your friends.

A controller is required in order to play local multiplayer.",
