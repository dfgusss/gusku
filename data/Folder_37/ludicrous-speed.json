    "About the game": "Run, jump, and wall-grind through an infinitely-generated track in VR! Race against the dangerous hazards using natural locomotion controls, surrounded by a surreal pulsating neon world that reacts to the music! Run to the in-game soundtrack or play your own from any other music source on your PC and the environment responds. Features Smooth and precise locomotion using natural movements. Sprint, leap, and wall grind your way down the deadly track, and collect rings for the highest score at extreme speeds. The infinite track increases in difficulty the deeper you progress. Modify its features, set its difficulty, and toggle more movement options for a further customized experience. The environment reacts to your music. Run to the music in game or listen to your own music of choice from any source on your PC and the music reactive world will respond. The stabilized second screen option is great for showcasing VR at parties or events. The guided tutorial and practice mode can help with the fundamental controls. (Ludicrous Speed features bright colors, flashy visual effects, and high speeds. Always be aware of your personal comfort levels, and if you experience any discomfort, take a break.)",
