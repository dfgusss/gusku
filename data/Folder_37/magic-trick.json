    "About the game": "Magic Trick is a magical skateboarding adventure game, featuring expressive skating movement and trick combos, a totally explorable whimsical sunset world, and adorable townsfolk offering quests and companionship. Magic Trick seeks to fulfill everyone’s greatest desire: being a skateboarding magician. The player embodies Sunset Isles’ newest resident: WizKid (pronouns: they/them), who can perform radical magic by using skate trick combos! The day is nearly over, but Wizkid wants to explore the town and meet their new neighbors before calling it a day. The twilight adventure begins at the skate park to hone their skills with skateboarding legend, Tony the Hawk. Tony teaches the player skating tricks ranging from a simple ollie to a gnarly backflip, while Wizkid’s magic allows the player to perform incredible feats such as skating at super speed, spawning a ramp from thin air, and flying to the top of the sky. The world is the player’s skatepark, with ramps and grind rails ready to be shredded! Help a curious cat get out of a tree, race a running rabbit down main street, or even explore your artistic side with some painterly pups by finding their collectible cards. Once Wizkid is ready to call it a day, the player can skate back home to the suburbs and celebrate with all their new friends.",
