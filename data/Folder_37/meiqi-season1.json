He has never been in a neighborhood, but there is something strange. It has been going on for 1 month. The door is noisy every night, but it sounds like ordinary. The couple quarreled, often with strange noises. Once I and the aunt Wang of the neighborhood committee went to the house to talk about the mediation. Who would think that Wang Aiguo and his wife Sun Meiqi did not admit the quarrel at all and could not do street work. The strangest thing is that Zhang Hongjun claimed that Wang Aiguo could still hear quarrels and strange noises every night after being arrested.   Site survey report: There were no traces of fighting in the house. Sun Meiqi was found dead on the bed when found, the child Wang Sifeng died in the toilet, and the toilet door was closed. There were no fingerprints in the room except Wang Aiguo's family. All doors and windows have not been traced.   The responsible criminal police decided to visit Wang Aiguo's home at night when the neighbor said. [DLC 'Fang Tingting' plot] In 1990, Zhao Weicai was 40 years old and had no girlfriend. Friends and relatives were very anxious. His father had four brothers and sisters. He was the fourth child and the boss was a girl. Therefore, Zhao Weicai had an aunt named Zhao Chunmei. In February 1990, shortly after the Spring Festival, Zhao Chunmei introduced Zhao Weicai a girlfriend named: Fang Tingting, a girl who looked very quiet, but just a month after meeting, Fang Tingting was diagnosed with mental illness and was hospitalized. Zhao Weicai complained about Auntie, how she introduced such a person. But strangely, another month later, Zhao Weicai took the initiative to visit Fang Tingting in a mental hospital. Since then, Fang Tingting's condition suddenly deteriorated and she died in a mental hospital. No one was willing to mention this at the Zhao family, and Zhao Weicai never happened. At that time, some people said that Fang Tingting was killed, but there was no evidence, and it was not known where the news came from the neighborhood. So Liu Qingchun contacted the mental hospital and planned to visit the room where Fang Tingting was at the time. However, the hospital believed that during the day the police came to investigate an incident that had not been filed and that it had a bad effect, so they decided to give Liu Qingchun time to enter and leave the hospital quarantine area freely but not to affect and disturb the patient. Li Jun, president of Anping Psychiatric Hospital, confessed: 'I'm really sorry for the Liu team. Since Fang Tingting's incident, the hospital has been greatly affected. In order to avoid greater losses, we cannot allow you to investigate without filing a case. After that, even the night shift of the nurse on duty was cancelled, and other patients have been affected to varying degrees because of the incident. Some have been transferred to hospital. You can see it in your own name, but please do not affect the rest of the patients. I Individuals still believe that Fang Tingting committed suicide. That night Liu Qingchun came to the inpatient department of Anping Psychiatric Hospital. [DLC 'Wang Sifeng' plot] 'Each school has a mysterious place that you never dare to go in, and here often precipitates all the mysteries since the school was established.' --- Liu Qingchun After the Sun Meiqi incident, Liu Qingchun came to Changzhuang Town Elementary School for the first time, and it happened that the school was closed. In the afternoon, Liu Qingchun sat at Wang Sifeng's desk and pondered the case, and fell asleep stupidly. When he woke up, it was already late at night, the door of the school building was locked, and Liu Qingchun didn't know if he was really asleep, or for some other reason suddenly this time. Principal Du Wenge's confession: 'Liu, I didn't expect such a big case in our school's children's home, our school must actively cooperate with the investigation. Wang Sifeng was in the second grade of fifth grade in the second teaching building. Today happens to be Sunday. You can check it out, but please don't go to the second floor, where there is always a place for sundries, and the janitors usually lock it. ' Anyway, he couldn't get out, so Liu Qingchun decided to explore the teaching building at night to see if there were any clues that would help the case. [DLC 'Wang Aiguo' plot] When Liu Qingchun woke up, he could feel something was wrong, but he couldn't remember anything. The only thing he could think of was the roar of the machine. After touching the back of the head, there was no feeling of being beaten, only the wrist felt pain, and the scarring caused by the violent bondage. The criminal police could have let him ignore the pain and quickly look around. This place looks like a factory's lounge. The door cannot be pushed and is blocked by something. Only the sound of machines working far away can be heard. After the Sun Meiqi incident, Liu Qingchun has been collecting evidence and investigating. Wang Aiguo, who is almost crazy, said that there was a problem in the factory. Now he was abducted to the factory somehow. Who is planning this? The first Iron and Steel Company's factory building in winter is terribly hot, let's escape from here first. [DLC 'Du Cuilan' (part one) plot] Du Cuilan and Sun Meiqi have been friends for many years. Du Cuilan and Zhou Jing were arranged to go to Yili, Xinjiang when they cut in the line. They did not know when they would return. When leaving, Du Cuilan asked Ding Wanwan to do it for himself, and Sun Meiqi didn't know why. Eighteen years later, Du Cuilan returned to the factory as an accountant and cried as soon as she met, saying: You are still alive, and I am worried about death. Sun Meiqi has been wondering for a long time. Four years later, Du Cuilan and Wu Dafu got on the train to Moscow. Liu Qingchun got a ticket at the factory. It may be Lao Li's. Lao Li didn't go there. I don't know where he went. Liu Qingchun asked the bureau and quickly got into the car in plain clothes. The director's opinion is: don't expose, investigate and obtain evidence, and return as soon as possible. [DLC 'Du Cuilan' (below) plot] files: When: January 8, 1991 at 16:16.

The dance hall was closed until 3:30. According to forensic data, the woman should have been drowned at this time. Judging from the time of the incident and the traces of the scene, the possibility of killing and throwing the corpse to the dance hall was ruled out, that is to say, the woman was drowned by the water in the concert hall. Only one body was found drowning at the crime scene. There were no signs of containers or flooding. The police immediately visited the customers who consumed in the song and dance hall that day, and they completely reflected that there was nothing abnormal that night. After the last song, the customers left one after another. No one has ever seen a strange woman or a large tank of water. some type of. Confession: Duty manager Wang Su, he recalled: 'I locked the door and left the dance hall at 4:30. Generally, the bartender would come to work at 4 o'clock and then do some simple cleaning until the evening to continue to open the door to welcome guests. I deliberately checked to see if the power was turned off, and then turned off the lights as usual. ' Cleaner Huang Qiang: 'I usually get off work with the manager, which is about 4:30. I told the manager to leave early yesterday when something happened at home, so I hurriedly cleaned after the customer left. I left at about 4 and I left. Suddenly there was a wind in the ballroom, whirring, this ballroom has two doors, one front door and one back door, and the door is closed. I do n’t know where the wind comes from, and it ’s cold. This is called a yin wind, and the ground can be blown up, indicating that someone is coming to ask for his life. I didn't dare to say, isn't this a feudal superstition, and quickly finished cleaning. ' The police also asked the deceased's work unit by phone: Sister Sun, head of the department store team at Lingshan Department Store: 'My name is Sister Sun, my last name is Sister Sun, and people usually call me Sister Sun. Our group Xiao Zhou (Zhou Shuzhen) returned to work yesterday. How could he be murdered in Beijing, You tease me. But she didn't come to work today, and she was never late. She was nice and enthusiastic. There was a mother at home. Her father died early, and she and her mother depended on each other. There was no object in more than thirty years. I do n’t like to go out, and I ’ve been to San Niang Bay the farthest. To say that her mother is a god, she is said to be good at Qimen Jiajia, the five elements and gossip. Go and see, drive away demons and evil spirits, etc. I said that this is not a feudal superstition. Officer Officer I, but a materialist, I listen to others.
