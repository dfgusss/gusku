BrainGood Games has done a fantastic job capturing boardgame elegance in a tidy videogame package, complete with a gently punishing metagame.' -Tom Chick, Quarter to Three SkyBoats / (100% positive) 'These guys, BrainGoodGames, make some wonderful boardgame-like strategy games. Their newest one, Skyboats, is in the Euro game genre, and it is simply outstanding.
