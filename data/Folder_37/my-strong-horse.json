Defeat 5 captains. Since this game is free, it cannot be maintained on the network. If the network doesn't work, don't use it. Steam supporters say they can't connect to the network, so I don't think they can connect to foreign countries. Corea has a good network. This is a game made by 3 people for 2 weeks, and they are currently working on different projects. Please pray for a better game in the future.",
