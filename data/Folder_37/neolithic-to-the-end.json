    "Release date": "Dec 7, 2021",
    "About the game": "TL:DR This may be the weirdest fever dream you've ever had. Life is full of absurdity More detailed information can be found on the fandom wiki. (It's also working in progress.) Current development priority: Some Features : Everything in a classical RPG plus... Bizarre adventures. First-person gunfight during battle. Convert supernatural (or not so supernatural) enemies to be your pets. Deployable traps, barricades, and furniture to decorate your home. Your very own home with a map editor. ALL MAPS in the game can be edited during the gameplay. Support import/export map to RMXP. Magical items and anomalies with their own mechanisms. Crafting items from 3D printers. Plant and harvest food and...something else. Endless procedurally generated quests from mission boards. A powerful cheat console that can run Ruby script. Minigames! The awesome part of an open-world RPG is, that you can get all those minigames for free! Frequent updates. Who knows what you can find in the future. DRM-Free! Highly customizable playing experience. Risks : (I will be totally honest with you. Thus, I put it here) 1, The game is made with a very old game engine. (For memories' sake) 2, There is only one developer. 3, I am terrible at 2D art. 4, I am not a native speaker of English. Thus, I provide an honest demo for you. The demo version will update all the way till a certain story is finished. It reflects the current stage of game development in almost real-time. If you find the game stopped updating for more than 14 days without any explanations, it's safe to assume I'm dead. In that case, do not buy the game. As the game is one of the first and last RMXP games that's ever been developed, I'm not exactly aiming to make it something great. (or even sane.) Instead, it needs to be unique and fun in a way that people can rarely see nowadays, to make people laugh maniacally even in a grimdark world where both the in-game world and the life circle of RMXP are coming to an end. Story Welcome to our secret society of [redacted]. We are among the most ancient ones in our line of work. For a long time, we have witnessed the rise and fall of many others. The situation is grim, the world almost ended in 2008, 2012, 2015, and 2020. Some people predict it will keep ending this year, next year, and the year after. But, well, even if that's true, even if the ending is inevitable, it is tragic, we are still alive. So, cheer up! We shall carry on. As long as we stand, the world shall never fall! To the end... Features: Unbalanced and Unfair Beneath the facet of the beautiful life people called 'normal', lurks the truth that this secret struggle is never fair. There are things that can hardly be killed. They may come in great numbers to overwhelm us. Even when not facing such a supernatural entity, a well-trained Kung-Fu master can still be killed by just a bullet. But, We Fight on With All We Have! We have guns and our own magics. We even learned to bind supernatural entities to our wills. We have tools and artifacts, we have skills ranging from combat to conversation. If there is a lock that can hardly be picked, try blowing it. There are always solutions. If not, may the butterflies preserve us. You Are Different. Your arrival was not expected. You were not on any lists. We know little about you. Show us, who you are and who you will become with all the perks/skills/proficiency you may develop. We may still stand a chance against all odds with your help. Lead us... In This Vast World Your loyal companions will follow you from ancient ruins to modern metropolis, from east to west. You will meet common folks we swear to protect, watching them live their 'normal' life. You will discover mysteries, and solve them when combat evil forces lurking in the dark. The Secret History The story behind this game: It's the first Neolithic game with English localization that comes to Steam since 2004 when the first game of Neolithic was published in a dark corner of China. Compared to a commercial game, this is more like a memento to the old golden age of RPG Maker XP (when indie games are really indie; when updates are free instead of being paid DLCs; when developers update games for years, even decades instead of abandon projects as soon as it's no longer profitable; when games are made with passion instead of money-hunger; And, when RPG Maker was not used to just make those cheap adult-only games.) This is NEOLITHIC! There are many games out there, made with modern tools and more than 1 developer. They are supposed to be better than mine. But, they are not. Why? Unauthorized Edit Detected! We also have cats! They are cute. :3",
