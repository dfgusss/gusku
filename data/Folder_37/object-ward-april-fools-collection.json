    "About the game": "Two silly April Fools games, all in one convenient location! For the past two years, I have made an April Fools' visual novel involving the cast from Object Ward , a dark comedy/psychological drama about the various misadventures of a man who sees everyone with an inanimate object for a head. Both amusing and terrifying readers, the AU spinoffs Object Wank and Lesbian Ward are certainly memorable games. By purchasing the April Fools' Collection, you can help fund the development of Object Ward! Any future April Fools games will be included here, forever 99 cents. Warning: Thugzilladev is not responsible for any brain cells that may be lost. Features: Object Ward's special brand of surreal dark humor Fully original soundtrack! 1800x1200 resolution Horrible puns 2021: Genre: Dark Comedy, Romance (MxMxF) Manson answers a few NSFW questions about some peculiar object heads. 7 minute read. Reading Object Ward’s demo is recommended due to various story references. 2022: Genre: Dark Comedy, Romance (FxF) Did you ever wish that Object Ward was less of a sausage (headed) party? How about a clam (headed) party instead? Then Lesbian Ward is here to save the day! A wholesome story about Madeline and Kandice sharing their love for one another. You can already guess the puns. 15 minute read. Not necessary to read Object Ward’s demo to understand.",
