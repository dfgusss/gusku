    "About the game": "Try to escape Peepo Island by completing its difficult obstacle course and puzzles while an army of very cute Peepos try to push you to your doom! Peepo Island is a single player third person 3D platformer where the goal is to navigate through a very difficult obstacle course full of deadly traps that will test your reflexes and perseverance. If the traps weren't enough, you also have to worry about an army of little Peepos that are constantly chasing you and trying to push you off the edge! But don't worry, because you can fight back! The game has checkpoints that save your progress so you can return to it later! If you are a Twitch streamer, you may connect with your Twitch account and have your chat spawn their own Peepos with their own Twitch username.",
