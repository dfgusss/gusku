    "About the game": "You go on a long journey as a ball. All you have to do is get to the top. You can't move alone. Because you're a ball without arms or legs. However, even if you can't move on your own, it's possible to move the ground you're standing on. Rotate and tilt the ground so that you can climb up! Of course, it will not be an easy journey. You can't stop or jump up wherever you want. Also, all kinds of obstacles will interfere with you. However, don't give up and go up. It doesn't matter how many times you fail. Even if it takes a lot of time, put all your strength into it, tilt the ground, and reach the top along with the tilted land. The top of the lonely world will wait for you forever.",
