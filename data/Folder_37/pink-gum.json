    "About the game": "We invite you to live through this short artistic thought-provoking interactive experience that doesn't need a single word. Illusions, dreams and love will be chewed together in this too familiar tale, full of bubbles, innocence and pain... A mouse-only story-driven game. Headphones strongly recommended. Between 10-20 minutes of playtime. A Mad Cream Games production. Directed by Agustín Pastore Burgos, with art by Inés Burgos Pía and music by Nicolás Pastore Burgos. It is not intended for children.",
