    "About the game": "Pocket Rocket is designed with speed-running in mind, our design philosophy was speed first, questions later. The questions being classics such as: 'Why is this so hard!?' and 'Oh come on I almost had it this time, right?' It's a game about maneuvering a small space rocket through obstacles to get the fastest possible scores. After you've beaten levels, you can retry them racing your own past ghost to improve your skills and your score! The game features obstacles like, but not limited to: Boosters Gravity Fields Rotating Obstacles All of these placed carefully to make you really feel the challenge and endure the pain. Try over and over again to beat a level only to watch that one guy (you know who) beat it in one go. So come on down to Pocket Rocket town and have yourself a wonderful time amongst the stars!",
