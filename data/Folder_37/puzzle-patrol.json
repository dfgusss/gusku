    "Name": "Puzzle Patrol",
    "Release date": "Feb 7, 2020",
    "About the game": "Puzzle Patrol is a unique and modern spin on the falling blocks arcade puzzler, inspired by classics like Tetris, Puyo Puyo, and Puzzle League. Swap and pop the cute monsters rising from the dungeons below to protect your town! Not your usual match-3 game! In Puzzle Patrol, moving your avatar will swap the adjacent monster. And unlike match-3 games, matched blocks in Puzzle Patrol do not pop automatically. This allows you to setup insane combos! Then pop the matched blocks by simply bumping into them! Features Local multiplayer versus mode, up to 4 players Local co-op mode Versus AI mode Time Attack mode Endless mode Zen mode Steam leaderboards Full controller support Simple controls (Only 4 arrow keys are needed per player, so you could probably fit 4 players on a single keyboard!) 4 different avatar skins to choose from!",
