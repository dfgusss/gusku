    "About the game": "Red Wings: American Aces puts you in the pilot’s seat of a nostalgic, action-packed arcade shooter illustrated in a fun comic-book style with a gaming mode for every occasion—local or online, solo or multiplayer. Prove yourself in exciting aerial battles and make a name for your squad as the best aces of WWI! A Multiplayer Must-play Do you believe in the strength of the squadron? Choose a map and game mode and gather your pilots to play in a team of up to five players against other squads in online multiplayer. Prefer flying solo and plucking others out of the sky? There’s game modes for that too! Compete with up to nine other pilots and fly to the top of the scoreboard. Local co-op is available for smaller fighter groups of one or two pilots for a much more ace-to-ace experience in various customizable game modes, including a campaign mode with 30 missions. Rise to the Challenge The clouds hide many dangers, there’s more than just enemy pilots waiting up there! Thunderstorms will blast your skill cooldowns, while sandstorms can make visibility spiral to near zero. To make things even more interesting, you’ll encounter other challenges such as missions where you’ll only be able to take out enemies with barrel rolls, planes that release a gas that will block your view when you least expect it, and more!

Strategize and rearrange your points depending on the mission and ensure you emerge from every dogfight victorious.
