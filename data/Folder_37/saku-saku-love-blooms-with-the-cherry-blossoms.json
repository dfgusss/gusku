    "About the game": "A girl who cannot fall in love. A boy who has no interest in love. If they were to fall in love with each other, how would the world change? From Palette , developers of 'Mashiro Iro Symphony', comes the romantic school comedy, 'Saku Saku: Love Blooms with the Cherry Blossoms'. Much like how 'Mashiro Iro Symphony' took place during the seasons of Fall and Winter, SakuSaku takes place during the Spring and Summer. WANTED!! Springtime. Cherry blossom season. It is a time of first encounters and final partings, a time when buds are sprouting. But for Asaba Yuma, a 2nd year student at Mihaya Academy, it was simply a gloomy day. Yuma was something of an accomplished love expert that all the girls in the academy came to for their romantic troubles. So skilled was he that there was even a 21,000 yen (taxes included) 'love bounty' placed upon his head. Whether it was seeking advice regarding jealousy or even infidelity, Yuma heard it all and increasingly it made him less and less interested in love. Then one day he met a mysterious girl. She had never fallen in love before. Yet, she believed that it was something truly wonderful. That girl also had a rather mysterious job. 'Do you want to fall in love?' As a fairy of love, her job was to make Yuma's love come true. Features: Full Japanese voice acting (except for the main character) Multiple endings and routes Character designs by Izumi Tsubasu ('Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka', 'Mashiro Iro Symphony') Opening theme by Sasaki Sayaka",
