    "About the game": "Scuffle Scoundrels is an arcade brawler for 2-to-4 rival captains of all ages. As you can only fire from your broadsides in this game, you must flank your friends or family members to let them taste the hot end of your cannon. It's a toony explosion of colorful fun, with devastating powerups, deadly hazards, and whimsical captains from all four corners of the world. The game is playable with all fully PC-compatible controllers, though we currently recommend the X-Box variety.",
