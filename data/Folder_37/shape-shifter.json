    "About the game": "Shape Shifter has four main game modes: JUMP MODE - In jump mode you score 1 point per jump while avoiding the red blocks of death. WAVE MODE - In wave mode you'll get 1 point for every evil red block that you leave behind. CLEAN MODE - Clean mode introduces awesome punch green elements which you can use to push the evil red blocks. Each green element you touch gives you 5 points. COMBO MODE - This game mode combines the other modes for a harder, faster, and stronger experience. 'Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.' - Bruce Lee",
