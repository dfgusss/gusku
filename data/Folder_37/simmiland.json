    "About the game": "Simmiland is a god game. Watch how mankind develops! What the heck is Simmiland? In Simmiland you create a small civilization that you can only influence indirectly by playing cards to the land, such as plants🍃 and minerals ⛰️. Playing a plant on a grass biome tile will result in a wheat plant, but playing a plant card somewhere else will also create something else. Try to experiment as much as you can! Playing cards costs ✨ 'faith' ✨ that you gain from the humans when they periodically pray for you, or when you fulfill their wishes. One may wish for a berry bush and another for a deadly plague ☠️ One of the more important cards is the ⚗️ 'inspect' ⚗️ card. This card can be played on items, objects and sometimes just on empty tiles. The inspect card will trigger an invention that will help the humans explore your world further. The way you shape the land and guide the humans will decide which way the humans will develop. They can go as far as to build a rocket! 🚀 The metagame You can play Simmiland in 2 different modes: Normal mode - your card deck is limited and you will find the apocalypse card at the bottom Endless mode - you can play an endless amount of cards, but you won't get any achievements In normal mode you will get achievements. Both achievements and progress will net you some in-game currency which you can use to buy new and more cards to fill your deck, giving opportunity to new possibilities. Features Quick, but relaxing, 10~60 minutes play per game An alternative endless mode where you can shape the land into infinity ~20 different cards 13 different biome types 30+ inventions to discover 40+ different resources to discover 20+ different achievements to find Sokpop makes a new game every two weeks!
