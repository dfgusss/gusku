    "About the game": "What is Sokobos? Sokobos is a minimalistic, brain-twisting puzzle game that expands on the classic block-pushing Sokoban formula. You'll be assembling anything from pillars to gardens and even an ancient Greek temple. Assemble Be it statues or pillars, they all have a beginning, middle and end. Push each part to its destination. Paint Some parts need to be painted first, color them by pushing them into the paint. Plan ahead There are obstacles you must push away, be careful where you move them away to though. And much more! You took an oath to the Greek gods. You're blessed with inhuman strength and tasked with building a temple for Zeus all by yourself. Once this task is complete, your town will flourish and outshine even the Athens. However, this is a tale of Greek tragedy, not everything will go as planned. 60 challenging levels Infinite undos Unique mechanics not found in other Sokoban titles Optional move optimisation mode with a leaderboard system Colorblind support; Trichromatic, Dichromatic and Monochromatic options. /",
