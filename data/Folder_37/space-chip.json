    "About the game": "Space Chip is a fun game set in Space with a nostalgic playmode which you have to pass through different levels full of adventure, teleporting through space gates and avoiding energy balls, spaceships, meteorites and “alienoids”. Inspired by games in the late eighties and early nineties keeping that special spirit and movements in 2D but with scenarios in 3D. You will find a different look with graphics created to make an atmosphere which is a throwback to the time where you will have fun. You will have to overcome four zones with addictive levels where the most important thing is the gameplay. The progress will be saved when you overcome the zone not the levels. Full game created with Blender Game Engine. Space Chip, play it! Full controller support: - Most of generic controllers. No controller support: - Xbox 360 or Play Station controller.",
