    "About the game": "Sqvishy is having a cheese-fueled nightmare, can you help poor puss parse fishtanks into oblivion? Orginally designed as a virtual arcade machine minigame inside Big Robot's 'The Light Keeps Us Safe' , this standalone version of Sqvishy is expanded and improved. Guide towering, tumbling fishtanks toward matching exit tiles in an increasingly frantic fever-dream of puss-based-puzzling. Sqvishy is a fast-paced action/puzzle game of visualization, forward-planning and sharp reflexes. Giant fishtanks spawn at the edges of a randomly generated grid and begin to roll... By switching the directions of the grid tiles your puzzled-puss can guide these colorful cages to matching exit tiles. For every fishtank freed you score a point, but for each one lost - either through collision with another fishtank or by rolling onto an edge - a point is deducted. You must reach a certain number of points to clear a level. There are six levels - newly generated each time you play - with exits, fishtank colors and spawns randomized. Find a level of difficulty that suits you and get puzzling! Features Six Levels of Difficulty Customizable Colors Full Controller Support Customizable Controls Cosmic Rainbows! Sqvishy will soon be appearing in original minigame form inside 'The Light Keeps Us Safe' . /",
