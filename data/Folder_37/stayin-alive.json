    "About the game": "Get A Whole New Lease On Life! Do your best to die, or to save your enemies from death in this frantic multiplayer game about life and death. Stayin' Alive is a game about wheelchair-bound retirees (the Suiciders ) who have decided it's high time to meet their maker, and nurses (the Saviors ) who must keep the old geezers alive at all costs. Choose your side and let the dying/saving begin! It's Check Out Time! As a retiree, you will need to craft lethal weapons of self-destruction out of ordinary items and hide yourself while attempting suicide. But beware: Saviors are looking for you and they're determined to save you from certain death. Life Is Precious ! As a Savior, your job is keeping the Suiciders alive by finding the correct life-saving tool for any situation and using that on whoever is dying. Sedate the old-timers and conduct them into containment rooms to prevent suicide and instantly earn your score. Power-up your job Look well around and find incredible items to either get special abilities if you are playing as a Savior, or instantly kill yourself if you are playing as a Suicider. Magic potions, teleport devices, a barrel of fireworks, a blow up doll... Every match lasts a few minutes and fast thinking is everything. Any time a Suicider dies or is confined, points are assigned determining the winning party at the end of the match. Play in a small retirement house in South America, a big hospital or even a forest, in up to 8 vs. 8 matches! Will you take or save lives in the first ever FPSS (First Person Saver/Suicider)? FEATURES: Online Multiplayer matches for up to 16 players (8 vs. 8) Save your enemies as a Savior. How good are you at keeping others safe? Kill yourself as a Suicider. How fast can you die? Craft your tools of death. Razors made out of toothbrushes. Auto-combustion kit made from Zippos. Creativity is the key. 6 ways to die, each one with its corresponding life-saver tool. Die like you always wanted to IRL (!?). Sedate and confine retirees. No real senior citizens were harmed in the making of this game. Awesome power-ups for Saviors to get special abilities, and crazy instant-death items for Suiciders to cut the job short. Cooperation is the key. Help your friends die, or save everyone.",
