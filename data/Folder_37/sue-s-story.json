    "About the game": "Sue's Story is a classic sci-fi adventure game in the spirit and tradition of a classic space alien thriller. Awakening on a cryo-transport ship hurtling towards a main sequence star, Proximus Centaurus, Sue is thrust into a terrifying game of hide and seek and a race against time to fix the ship, and dock successfully at the orbital platform. It is completely free, as a demonstration of my ability as a solo indie developer to to build a fun and challenging classic sci-fi in the spirit of Alien: Isolation and Dead Space. 'The sound of a ship exiting hyperspace was impossible to hear in the vacuum of space, of course, but the visual effect was dramatic and breathtaking. There was no observer to see it arrive this time. A little flicker of light, then a small circle like spherical lightning following by the emergence of the spacecraft decelerating in the blink of an eye. Outside the event was soundless, inside another matter. A loud thunderclap echoed through the desk of ship, and a shimmering of the stars behind the craft lasted only just a second and then was snuffed out. Then the ship drifted slowly and ominously above the planet to which it had arrived. The planet revolved slowly underneath as the ship’s thrusters fired up unaware of the violence of the arrival of the unexpected visitor, but deep within the ship awareness grew. A consciousness slowly that slowly emerged out of hyper-sleep. A humanoid mind. Female. Dazed and confused she awoke to the sounds of emergency klaxons ringing out through the vessel. Red emergency lighting flashed through the cryo-deck. Cruelly ripped from stasis, she shook and trembled, then after a moment beat her fists against the inside of the cryo-chamber. Screaming.'",
