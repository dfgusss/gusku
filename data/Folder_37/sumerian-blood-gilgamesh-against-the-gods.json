    "About the game": "The deep sands of the desert are blend with the blood of Sumerian who fought in the battle that shaped the fate of the world. In a daring choice that was both heroic and selfish, Gilgamesh decided to take a last stand against the gods' army of An. Facing the annihilation of all civilization, and trying to avoid his own punishment, the charismatic hero Gilgamesh convinced the people of Sumer to fight against their own creators and break the old order of the worlds. 'Sumerian Blood: Gilgamesh against the Gods' is a mix of chess like strategy with shooter one on one battles that relies on acquired skill both in combat and strategy. It is a game that is not too hard to pick, but can take a long time to master. The game's unique units were tested against each other and tweaked for the best balance we could find over a testing period of one year(Thanks to my dear friend lozzer s duck) Features: Board strategy 16 unique fighting units each with it's own unique abilities Single Player Local Multiplayer Online multiplayer Sumerian and Mesopotamia mythology based design. Balanced replayable challenging game. NOTICE: There are three things in this game that are not fully developed yet: 1) Gamepad support is not fully supported yet. 2) Single player AI is basic and will improve greatly in the near future. 3) Some graphical issues in the online multiplayer where you go back from battle and the loading of the board looks like an artifact and will be fixed. These 3 things will be improved in the near future.",
