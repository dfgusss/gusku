    "About the game": "Oh my god, look! It's Powerman! He's coming to save us! ... Right? It all happens in Centropolis, a city so quiet their local newspaper almost went out of business. Strange meteors came from space and (very conveniently) they all fell there. Each meteor was carrying an even stranger crystal that gave people super powers. But not all people are good people, some of them were jerks. They became super villains. Now, there isn't much to super villain in Centropolis, so people started robbing ice-cream shops and hair salons, very sad actually. But those who found the crystals and were good people would not let their city go awry (that's a word, right?). Fight for your right to cause havok (I think that's also a word) or your right to live in a peaceful place in Centropolis, the city of heroes! Features: Be a superhero or a supervillain, each character with their own innate special powers. Different crystals each with their own secondary superpower to combine with your character's abilities Fly around the city, run very fast or jump really high... we also have huge balls. Obtain gems when you win a match to unlock new characters in the store Switch between superhero and secret identity to hide among the civilians pretending you're a concerned citizen, which you're not.",
