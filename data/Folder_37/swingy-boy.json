    "Release date": "Feb 9, 2021",
    "About the game": "The only method of controlling the character is the use of the hook. To swing the hook you spin the mouse in a circular motion. When the hook has the right momentum you press the left mouse button which will let go of the hook and it will fly in the direction it was thrown in. Once the hook hits an object that can be hooked onto that object will remain connected to the hook until the left mouse button is lifted. With the hook connected to the object you can pull down on the mouse to pull yourself closer to the object you are connected to or you can push the mouse up to put some slack on the rope. You can swing left and right by moving the mouse in either direction bear in mind the hook also has to be connected to an object to be able to do that.",
