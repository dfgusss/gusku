Features: - 18 Maps - 48 Tanks - Cheat Codes - 8 Player Support - Multiple Monitor Support - Remote Play Compatible - Local and Global Stat Boards A note from the creator: Tank Game is a project that I worked on through my time in college, while working to get a degree in Computer Engineering. I mostly uploaded it to steam for the people at my university that loved to play it whenever it was brought to school game jams. The game isn't perfect. There are bugs. There are things that could be better. A lot better. Now that I have a full-time Unity Dev position, I plan on restarting this project from scratch with my new found knowledge. If that ever sees the light of day, I'll be sure to make an announcement here. In the mean time, please enjoy my game. Tanks for playing, -Keegan",
