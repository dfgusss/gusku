Build your team Each player has their set of strengths and weaknesses that you’ll have to factor in to recruit &amp; get the best out of them. Dozens of parameters govern how each player behaves, both in and out of the field. Playstyle, favorite surface, morphology, temper, physical condition: all these aspects make each player unique.

Before an important match or in-between 2 sets, your players need to know they can count on your rhetorical skills to give them that extra boost they need. Or just let the racket do the talking. Coach your players in real time A unique 3D match engine with 3D match stats gives you the power. Select pre-made game plans for a faster kickoff, or dig into every aspect of your players’ playstyles. Should they return down the line or at the center? High or low power?
