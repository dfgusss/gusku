    "About the game": "The Essence Reaper Ritual is an Indie videogame, a classical epic fantasy RPG, where you lead a party of up to 5 adventurers. Your decisions will shape the world of Eternalia and the party members willing to join you. For now, we will release the beta version so you people can give us your opinions on the things you would like to change. My first videogame I made for fun with almost no budget. No perfect obviously, but any bug or stuff to improve please let me know and I work on that on my free time. An ancient creature, the Great Necromancer, who was thought destroyed 1000 years ago is rising again, he is one with the power to absorb the essence of any living creature and even the very essence of the gods. With the gods of not help for the living, what would happen if the solution is as daresome as the evil rising? What if the best solution seems to summon a mighty entropic demon with the ability to withstand the Great Necromancer´s powers? This is the story of the group of adventures who joined forces to save the world of Eternalia and make the decisions to change it forever. This is your adventure, these are your choices. Your decisions will shape your character as well as others and the world of Ethernalia. By making choices during your adventures, your character will take a different Spiritual Path; Order or Entropy, Benign or Evil, or keep yourself apart remaining neutral to any of those universal forces. Your actions will define your character, but they will also have an impact on the companions willing to join your party as well as the regiments and allies willing to join your army ... or they might just fight against you if they have an antagonist alignment. Essencereaper Ritual is a RPG (Rol Playing Game).  As a RPG game you will travel over the west part of the continent known as Ethernalia, looting, questing, killing monsters while followed during your adventures by up to 4 companions. There might be up 12 different companions that could join your cause. During the adventures, you will also gather allies, territories and regiments to make an army that you will need to fight enemies. During the game, depending of your actions and the Spiritual Path you choose, the companions willing to join you or stay with you will be different, and that goes as well for the regiments you can recruit for your army . There are some antogonism rewards you will get by choosing a particular decision that favour one spiritual path. Choose to fight slavers, and a Paladin companion might join you, choose to help the slavers and you may get gold and a dark paladin in your party. Those are your choices, and it is up to you to shape the destiny of you character as well as Ethernalia course of events. Mind this is the beta version of the videogame! Play it now and let us know what you want to change on the videogame!",
