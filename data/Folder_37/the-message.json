    "About the game": "I answered the call, got into the car, arrived at the place ... Fun waiting me. Each level is an arena. Find a weapon and kill everyone. Random: There are elements of randomness in the game: weapons have random components, enemies get random weapons and do not repeat the route. Different ways to complete level In most levels you can choose different ways for completing. Rooms got more than 1 enters, more than 1 stair lead to 2 floor etc. Cruelty Enemies can be dismembered. Blood reacts on surfaces. If it is a ceiling, it will drip; if it is on the wall, it will flow. 80th The game takes place in the 80s. Russia won the Cold War and a mass settlement of Russians, including criminals, began in the United States. The latter you have to kill. Weapon The game has a wide variety of firearms (machine guns, shotguns, pistols, etc.), as well as edged weapons. The weapon has modifications (muzzle attachments, stocks, handles, etc.) Masks Before starting the level, you can choose a mask that will give you the ability. For example: getting brass knuckles at the beginning of the level, the ability to shoot from 2 hands, more blood, etc. Based on Hotline Miami.",
