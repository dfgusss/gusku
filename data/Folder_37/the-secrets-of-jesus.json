    "About the game": "What if Jesus had been able to escape his crucifixion? Would he escape the Romans, who are still bent on enforcing their death sentence? Or maybe even start a family with his great love? Just slip into his role and figure it out! But before it is time to settle down with his beloved lady, there is still a lot to do. There are a lot of riddles to be solved and secrets to be revealed while searching for a missing person. Delve into the atmosphere of the first century. Experience a fascinating adventure filled with biblical quotes, allusions to the Holy Scripture, and a lot of black humor. Play detective and decide at the end of the game for yourself which version of the historical narrative you want to believe in. To enjoy this adventure, it does not matter which religion you belong to, or if you consider the bible to be just a thick book of fairytales. Nobody is supposed to be 'proselytized' and nobody's religious feelings are supposed to get offended. All you need to enjoy this game is a computer which fulfills the minimum technical requirements, as well as a liking for stories, the solving of riddles, and a good sense of humor. Then 7-12 hours of thrilling entertainment are waiting for you.",
