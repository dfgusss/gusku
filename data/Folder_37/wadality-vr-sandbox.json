That 'flappy' locomotion system gives a fresh flying experience during the game. Character The chewed gum was abandoned by a child on the beach, who had thrown it into the ocean. The radioactive particles penetrated its body, giving it life. It used its powers to find more chewed gum pieces and seal them together to form a whole piece of gum. The chewed gum eventually found bigger pieces of chewed gum and repaired them. Years later, the chewed gum is now a living weapon with incredible abilities! The chewed gum finds its way out of the ocean and into the atmosphere. The chewing gum gets on a satellite that is circling Earth. It's up to you, the chewed gum, to use your powers to stop the satellite from crashing into Earth! The chewed gum uses its incredible abilities, such as being able to stick to walls and ceilings, to reach the satellite. The chewed gum sticks to the satellite and begins repairing it. It eventually stops the crashing sequence and saves Earth! The chewing gum becomes a hero! Continuing the story, the chewed gum attracts a person's attention. The person starts to eat it and realizes that it tastes like strawberry! The chewing gum is happy and talented because of its journey, but sadly it's about to be eaten again.
