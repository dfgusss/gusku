    "About the game": "The game takes place on Whiperwind prison, you're the newest inmate there and a terrible event ocurred while you were sleeping, now it's up to you to discorver what happened and why it happened, searching for evidences, solving puzzles, taking decisions. The story is very subtle, you'll need to explore, read the notes and messages left and think to discover how everything happened and decide what to do! You'll control the character on first person and you will be able to interact with the ambient as you acquire items, like lockpicks, crowbars, and many more! The puzzles are a little hard for newer players, if you have played other similar games you will probably understand the mechanics a little faster. The graphics are based on a VHS recording with pixelated rendering. The world has a lot of details and storytelling to immerse you on this world. The music is creepy and keeps you on the suspense mood!",
