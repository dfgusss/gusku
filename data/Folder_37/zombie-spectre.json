    "About the game": "The first ever fully Agile Indie game. Released over a year ago on mobile with weekly releases improving and evolving the game incrementally. There's no game design document. Only a back story. As long as the improvements match the backstory and game mechanics, we'll add it into the game! Brief back story: The world has become overrun by souls originating from earth but entangled with a parallel universe. The cause driven by madness and survival. Defend humanity at all costs. Track down the origin of the entangled and defeat the enemies that ensue. Defend your party and equip them with weapon upgrades. Support the resistance effort by accepting missions. Take on swarms of zombies and huge zombie boss battles. Use powers and weapons obtained through transdimensional technology. You start the game with a powerful fire axe that has transdimensional power attack capabilities. The game is currently an evolving mobile title available on Android and IOS. The game has a single code base. The code running on all platforms is the same. Steam, Nintendo switch and Xbox are in our backlog but top priorities right now are back story elements, weapons and characters.",
