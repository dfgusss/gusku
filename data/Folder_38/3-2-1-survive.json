WHO THIS CRAZY FRENCH GUY WHO HAVE MADE THIS GAME ? Hello, my name is Yannstr I'm french and have the idea to made a great challenge. I know absoolutly nothing in game creating, and when i said nothing, that's mean about programming, game designe, script, ect.... I decide suddenly to make a game in basing only on tutorial on a free game engine. I starting to download Godot engine, to learn how to use it and how to programming in GDScript with a tutorial called 'your first game'. After this tutorial, I decide to use the gameplay of it and transforme to an addictive game, with some personal thing which is not on the tutorial. In making a game without knowledg, I try to answere a question : can we be a game creator, without studying how we do and without to work with a compagny, juste be an normal individue and launch a game like this ? Maybe someone have already answered in that's question by making his game and sell it on steam, or maybe i'm the only who do that's. In all case, I hope that's my game enjoy you and maybe can make an new professional way without studying.",
