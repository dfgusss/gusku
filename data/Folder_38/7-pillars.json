Core feature: CHOICES MATTER! One ending, but two different paths to get there. Story: You control a young man named CJ. Little is known about your history, but you are thrust right into a war with Ethos. She has returned after 500 years to establish her pillars and conquer the earth. It seems almost everyone is dead and it is up to you and your friends to stop her. You will have to make a handful of tough choices along the way and one in particular will affect how you face Ethos in the final battle.
