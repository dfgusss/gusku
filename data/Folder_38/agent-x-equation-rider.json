When you are happy with your equations you press start and ride down the level on your vehicle! And of course you can do tricks to score extra experience! Inspiring Future Engineers Agent X was designed to make learning happen through exploration. The player is introduced to the concepts of algebraic equations and how to manipulate them by modifying the terms. The simple buttons makes learning the concepts of algebraic equations fun and easy. The Vehicles Agent X has 10 vehicles that you can unlock with experience points that you gain from collecting items and doing tricks. Vehicles have different stats and also design considerations. Explore the different benefits of each vehicle and find the one that best suits your play style!",
