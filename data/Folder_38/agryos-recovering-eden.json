    "About the game": "AGRYOS: Recovering Eden is a third-person shooter with elements of a bullet hell where you play as Neziha, an adventurer fighting to recover the Branch of Eden from a failed space colony. Destroy hordes of robots with Neziha’s versatile arm cannon as you blast through this fallen AI-created society. The story takes place in the AGRYOS Facility on the planet Axenum, a once thriving AI civilization dedicated to creating a new home for humanity. Although Axenum failed its directive, its resources are still functional—especially its powerful agricultural starter, the so-called “Branch of Eden”. Your mission is to get it back! Versatile Weapons Choose between 3 distinct guns to destroy the once-dormant robots defending the Branch from outsiders. With various weapons such as the Disruptor, Carbine, and Scattershot, decide how you want to tactfully eliminate the threats as you use Neziha’s highly mobile thrusters to dash and leap around the massive AGRYOS Facility. About the Team AGRYOS: Recovering Eden was made by graduate students at SMU Guildhall as their Capstone project over the course of five months. The game was designed and produced by a diverse group representing a variety of cultures, nationalities, genders, and sexual identities. Features Single-player experience: Kill hordes of dormant robots, dodging energy bullets Multi-use arm cannon: Choose between the Disruptor, Carbine, and Scattershot High mobility: Dash and double jump around the expansive rooms of the AGRYOS Facility",
