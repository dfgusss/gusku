    "Release date": "Mar 7, 2022",
    "About the game": "Through challenges, use the given elements to craft transitional elements to reach given objective ! Challenges will gradually increase difficulties, starting with one or two steps crafts and finishing with dozen of intermediate elements ! Use sandbox mode to freely craft items together and maybe succeed to create rare items, and to discover everything ! Hundred of elements are available to craft, some are easy to guess, but the latest are not that easy ... Would you be able to craft every item ? To resolve every challenge ? Only one way to know: begin the new apprentice of Alchemistry ! Note: A Demo is available for free for you to try the game ! Developer Notes I am a solo developer working on that game for few months in my free time. I really hope you will have fun and relax with this game :) Working on a small and relaxing puzzle/crafting game was a dream I got for a while. I hope that game will be a new step in the direction of a full time indie life. So thank you for any small step you participate in to help me creating this game. This game will be updated as long I have nice ideas I can add without redoing the game from scratch, as I did with the previous game. And even your features ideas can be added if compatible ! We also have a discord community, if you want to join us, where you can share your opinions, questions, etc. about the game.",
