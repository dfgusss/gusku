    "About the game": "KEY FEATURES: VR | DESKTOP PC MULTIPLAYER CROSSPLAY 10+ PLAYER CO-OP &amp; SINGLE PLAYER MODES INTERACTIVE VEHICLES &amp; AIRCRAFT SURVIVE &amp; ESCAPE AN ALIEN INVASION TRY THE FREE DEMO FIRST ​Check compatibility and performance of your VR system Confirm your VR controller and gameplay preferences are supported​ We want anyone interested in this game to be happy with their purchase. If you have any questions or need support, there are many ways to get in touch with either of the two developers working on this game. VR | DESKTOP PC MULTIPLAYER CROSSPLAY Alien Dawn bridges the gap between VR &amp; Desktop players in this sci-fi action multiplayer game. While this game was designed with VR in mind first, VR adoption by a large percentage of people still has a long way to go. That is why it is so important to include a Desktop mode that is just as fun as the VR version along with parity of the VR player features. If you're a VR player looking for a game to enjoy with your friends that have yet to adopt VR, this is it. 10+ PLAYER CO-OP &amp; SINGLE PLAYER MODES Gaming communities grow and it can suck to leave someone out of the game. Alien Dawn accommodates large groups of friends or random players in its procedurally generated Escape Mode, which of course includes VR &amp; Desktop players playing together. Working as a team to Escape can be very rewarding, but it's also completely playable as a lone wolf (Single Player). INTERACTIVE VEHICLES &amp; AIRCRAFT This game takes place in a large open world, so vehicles are vital to the experience of the game to keep it from being a walking simulator. Right now there are vehicles in the main game mode, but in our prototype room available in the current build there are helicopters to fly designed for future modes. SURVIVE &amp; ESCAPE AN ALIEN INVASION The Escape Game Mode is the primary mission available in this version of the game and it is designed to give you a fresh experience playing each time you play whether you're playing on-line or in single player. The mission starts with you crash landing in a helicopter and having to search your way through the procedurally generated locations to call for a helicopter extraction, all while avoiding a gigantic mothership flying in the sky and her minions.
