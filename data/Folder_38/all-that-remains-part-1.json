    "About the game": "“Duncan Price is paranoid” they used to say. He’s just a “local nut” they said. They used to say a lot of things about him. Now they don’t say anything. Because they’re dead. Waking up in what appears to be his father’s old bunker, Campbell Price is confused. Last night was pretty crazy, but not that crazy. How did he end up here? Hearing a familiar voice over a 2-way radio, your sister says you’ve been put in the bunker for your own safety. Fearing for your sister’s life, who has also been locked up for her protection, you must escape the bunker and find her before it’s too late. Before you’re ... all that remains. All That Remains is a first person adventure game set in, what seems to be, a cold war era bunker. You find yourself locked up with a spotty memory and an uncontrollable urge to escape. Collect items, unlock stuff, solve puzzles, and find your sister! Key Features In game camera so you can take photos of all the clues you find. Less back tracking! Plenty of puzzles to get stuck on. Beautiful soundtrack composed by Richard J. Moir. Auto-save feature, never lose your progress again! The Glitch Camera Use the Glitch Camera to: Take photos of everything you find. Be it posters, clues, walls, or disturbing blood stains. Write notes on them like a real detective. Use less paper, kill fewer trees, save the planet! Use your notes to solve puzzles. Pop multiple photos out so that you can look at them at the same time. Please search for us on Twitter, Facebook, Discord, and the Web to stay in touch!",
