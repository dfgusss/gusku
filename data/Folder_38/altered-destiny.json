Follow P.J. through a marvelous realm of acid pools and frags, quirls and fluboxes, floaters and wraiths. There's a deep mystery here that only he – with your help – can solve. Encounter dozens of alien lifeforms on your journey to save the universe. Unravel multiple layers of intriguing puzzles and solutions. Immerse yourself in a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack with more than 25 songs. Explore over 90 screens filled with vibrant colors and surprising animation. Choose from point-and-click or arrow-key navigation at your choice of game speed. Interact with the world through a text parser that recognizes full sentences and more than 1,500 words.",
