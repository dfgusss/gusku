    "About the game": "Antithesis is a top-down action arcade game where you control one spaceship with each hand: one with WASD and one with the arrow keys (alternatively, one with each joystick of a controller). There are four levels to beat by getting a certain score, and one endless level in which you have to try and get the highest possible score, and who knows, maybe even get a spot in the leaderboards? Unique Selling Points High intensity, frantic gameplay that rewards skillful players. Unique challenge of hand independence, which will test you in ways you're not familiar with. Features Control a Green Ship which loses health constantly. Avoid all asteroids and lasers, but try to pick up powerups. Control a Purple Ship which gives the Green Ship health back upon destroying asteroids, but cannot die or pick up powerups. Collect 4 different powerups. Survive 3 life-threatening events. Beat 4 levels, ranging from easy to impossible. Get a high score in endless mode. Good luck getting a spot in the leaderboards! Have fun! :)",
