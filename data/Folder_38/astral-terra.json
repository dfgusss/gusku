There was neither light nor darkness, nor form nor striving. Yet in time, there was the slightest movement in the gray. So slowly at first, that none might notice, even had there been one to watch. Over eons of uncounted time, the gray gathered itself in a single place. A thing like a smooth gray egg coalesced, then shrunk and contracted until in an explosive burst, The Two were born: One of Light, the Other of Darkness. The Great Lovers, Lakana the White, Goddess of Light and Order, and Visaku the Black, God of Darkness and Chaos, blossomed forth into the universe. [2 THE FIRST CHILDREN] In the fullness of time, the Two begat the First Children. The Firstborn was enigmatic. They named him Davanu, and tall and proud, Crowned with mighty horns and lusting always for power. Red is his color. Next in their line was Da’lea the Green, joyful and merciful, Prone to rapid change in mood, but mighty in her generosity and mirth. Finally, in a pregnancy that nearly killed Lakana were born the Four: Ravanyx the Golden, fiery in both temperament and appearance; Vaya the color of Sky, fast and effortless in motion, controlled by none; Nitluru the Brown, dwarfed and sturdy, slow to anger, but mighty in wrath; And Tagaryl, green like the Sea, cold and deep, filled with secrets...
