    "About the game": "AYAHUASCA Kosmik Journey is a Virtual Reality film in which participants are immersed in visions triggered by a dose of ayahuasca. Each virtual trip is its own experience, as different views and perspectives will reveal new ways of seeing and understanding. Tap into your inner sense of calm and lose yourself in the kosmik journey. KEY FEATURES Motion sensors in the headset allow the system to keep track of your movement and posture and react accordingly. The visions will either intensify or diminish, depending on movement and angles of viewing. The spectator lives through the eyes of director Jan Kounen, who for over 20 years has been traveling to the heart of the Amazon to experience Ayahuasca with local tribes. Staying faithful to the original Shipibo tradition of consuming this plant as a transformative and meditative ritual, the psychedelic journey is guided by an indigenous South American shaman. Filmed in 360 ͒, AYAHUASCA’s conceived for HTC Vive, Oculus, or Playstation VR and can be viewed as a 360 ͒ video. AYAHUASCA has been internationally recognized at the following festivals: Best Documentary Raindance 2019, Nominee at Tribeca 2019, Annecy 2019, Sandbox Qingdao 2019, BIFAN 2019, Kaohsiung 2019, Sonar 2019, Sitges 2019, MIFF 2019.",
