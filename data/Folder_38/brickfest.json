    "About the game": "Score points by hitting bricks. Bricks will sometimes drop buffs and debuffs to your game. Some add extra balls, change speed, alter paddle size, or add shields. Buffs that are caught by the player will cause the game to adapt and drop more counters, so learn to dodge! Each ball present in the game multiplies a brick's score value, so learn to juggle! The speed of a ball can further double the value at max speed, so learn to juggle faster! Persistent game mode where more bricks spawn, death rains on you, and you try to last as long as possible. More features, game modes, levels, and mechanics will be released in free content updates indefinitely.",
