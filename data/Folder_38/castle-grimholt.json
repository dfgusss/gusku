Castle Grimholt is a 2D action adventure games that plays like the classic 16-bit era games with a modern twist - fight powerful bosses, explore secret areas, meet a diverse cast of characters, and unravel forgotten lore. Epic boss battles: Every enemy is a unique and challenging boss encounter, requiring fresh strategies and mastery to overcome. Rewarding exploration: The island of Castle Grimholt is filled to the brim with forgotten secrets, hiding optional areas, bosses and lore discoveries, all intricately interconnected. Interesting encounters: Many other heroes, opportunists and others have been drawn to the castle; your interactions with them and decisions you make will have lasting effects. Scattered lore: Around the island and castle are tidbits of lore to piece together the dark history of the castle and the wider world, if you choose to seek them out. Easy to learn, hard to master: Combat is simple: attack, move and roll - no skill trees, additional weapons or upgrades - however every boss will demand a new level of mastery of these basic actions, and progression is driven purely by honing your skills, giving a deeply rewarding combat experience.",
