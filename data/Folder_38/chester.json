    "About the game": "EPILEPSY WARNING: Chester includes multiple flashing lights/screens. After a tragic accident, you find yourself fighting your worst fears. With your best friend Chester at your side, you'll face down what lurks in the dark. Be brave, but make decisions carefully. They'll determine whether you survive the night or not. Chester is a first-person short-horror exploration game based off of childhood nightmares. After a tragic accident, you find yourself trapped in a horrific situation. You'll have to make quick decisions, and keep your wits about you as you're being hunted in your own home. The player's decisions will result in a good or bad ending, so be smart, and thoughtful at every turn. Chester may take you a short amount of time to complete, or it may take you a long amount of time to complete. This is purely a result of your gameplay. Be wary, keep your eyes open, and ears attentive. The player will interact with the environment, and will have to explore in order to complete the game and stay alive. Chester is based off of our simple childhood fears. What if something is lurking in the dark? What if we lose our favorite plush toy? What if we are alone? What if... there is an intruder? Much of this game is pulled directly from the childhood nightmares and fears that we all shared.",
