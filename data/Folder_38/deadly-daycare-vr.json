    "About the game": "Student Project Deadly Daycare is the capstone game made by Little Chair , a team of 12 from the University of Utah . For many of us, it is our first shipped game. This game was made by 3 engineers, 7 artists/tech-artists, and 2 designers. Music and sound were provided by two students from the Berklee School of Music in Boston. This game was made with Unity, Maya, and various other software. Cute and Toony Virtual Reality Using virtual reality, immerse yourself into a toon-styled daycare! With weird and wacky elements, embark on a fantastic experience with adorable-yet-monstrous creatures! Creature Interaction Given a bestiary as a guide, explore the daycare for tools and toys required to appease your whimsical wards. From normal objectives like feeding and bathing, to outlandish tasks like rituals and witchcraft, every chaotic creature will have unique demands, attitudes, sizes, and challenges. Challenging Consequences As their caretaker, your main goal is to keep the creatures happy. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done, as they don’t always play nice. These creatures are dangerous, and if you can’t keep up with their demands, you may have to pay the ultimate price... Key Features A variety of creatures that each pose a unique challenge! A highly interactable environment for object exploration! See monsters in a new and friendlier light!",
