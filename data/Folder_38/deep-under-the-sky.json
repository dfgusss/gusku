Time your bursts just right to explore every cleft and cranny of the floating beasts on the mysterious dark side of Venus. There's only one button but don't be fooled - you'll have to think like a jellyfish and zen to the heady biorhythms of the planet before you learn its secrets. Deep Under the Sky has Trippy chillout soundtrack 80 levels in four gorgeous worlds to explore Jet-powered jellyfish with grappling hook tentacles Only one button - play while petting your cat! Hidden bonus stars even I can't reach Secret (well I just ruined it didn't I) hardcore mode Physics based explosions - jellyfish bits everywhere! Turn into a ball and roll like Samus Bouncers, gates, mines and other obstacles More particle effects than your human brain can handle",
