    "About the game": "The grapes of wrath have finally ripened — their vines bring forth an intoxicating fruit. Abe never chose to come to Abbotsford. The village glows in a rural backwardness that fills him with a lingering dread. Soon however, things begin to look up, as he is hired as a delivery boy by Ina, the headstrong editor-in-chief of the school paper. Before long Abe and Ina begin to uncover unsettling details about the island's past, including the mysterious evacuation of over half its populace. Gradually, they become caught up in an intricate web of political corruption, organized crime, and a highly secretive local church. Deluge: Threnody of Crashing Waves is a mysterious visual novel with psychological and lovecraftian undertones.

Mei Put your hand on these stones. Can you feel their calming warmth? Mei doesn't go to school.
