Story Background The New World is in a state of turmoil after a mysterious dark lord returned to the world to resurrect and reclaim control of his wicked army, the Night Devil Legion. They seek to take revenge on the foolish mortal Kings who had forsaken them, by releasing the all-powerful Energy of Chaos that mutated the natural environment and caused the population to completely lose their minds. The insanity spread through the world causing many people to become unnecessarily violent with each other. This disruptive behavior made it easier for never-ending disputes to develop between the Kingdoms, which eventually lead to an all-out world war breaking out . You are destined to liberate your Kingdom by destroying the malicious dark lord who is orchestrating the war from the shadows, thus preventing the Energy of Chaos from further infecting the minds of the people of your Kingdom.",
