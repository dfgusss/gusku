    "About the game": "Doors Quest Demo is a 2d walking simulator that is as short as it is terrible. Enter an immersive world... wait, that's not right. What's the opposite of immersive? Never mind, let's start over. Enter a world... no, I think world is too strong of a word also, so......... ughhh.... Ok, you're trapped in a room. But don't worry, I've given you all the tools you need to get out. Well, tool. This isn't a complicated game. So, you're in a room, right? And there's a door. You'll recognize it, even though the graphics are so bad that it doesn't look like a door. That's because there is a sign in front of it that says 'EXIT' and has an arrow pointing to the previously described door. So you'll just open that and everything will be fine. OH NO, IT'S LOCKED!!! Why would a cruel game developer do this to you? Wait a minute, I think I see something on the other side of the room. Multiple somethings, in fact. Maybe one of those things can help... Features: - Six things that you can pick up! - Five Steam Achievements! - Four original pieces of music! - Three possible endings! - Two gratuitous exclamation points!!! - One fire! - Zero quality! So don't be a negative one, play Doors Quest Demo today. It is positively a thing! Mature content warning: This game contains violence, blood, death, alcohol, and swearing. It may not be suitable for players offended by such things.",
