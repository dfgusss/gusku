    "About the game": "EF EVE™ – volumetric video platform is dedicated to bringing real world into VR. EF EVE ™ is a platform where you can explore scanned real world places, objects and experience holographic events in virtual reality. It is a place where people from around the world capture themselves as holograms to bring their music and dance performances, photogrammetry enthusiasts share their scans of heritage sites, art pieces and teleport us to places we didn’t know existed. Simple navigation allows you to choose between environments and holographic events or you can create your own experience by using editing tools to manipulate size, place and load multiple holographic events into one environment. Enjoy it in VR or in Desktop mode. Can I capture my own holographic events? Volumetric Capture has never been easier! EF EVE™ camera app allows to record and live-stream your own HD quality VolCap videos into Virtual reality within seconds. Your hologram can be easily brought to life in any Unity based immersive experience, game, story and shared with people via EF EVE Platform. Now you can record the World around you the way it is - in 3D volume. All you need is our camera app, 2 Kinect v2 cameras and Windows 10 ready PC.",
