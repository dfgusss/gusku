    "About the game": "STORY The end of the Interstellar War left the planet of Arcadia in ruins. But just when the world began to see peace and stability, the 'Auto Drones' went berserk and brought destruction to the lands. 'Sion Obsidias' will pilot the high-tech aerial combat device, the 'Valkyrie', to fight against the Auto Drones and restore peace to the world. CONSEPT ELYSION is a game that combines 2D Anime girls, the military and Sci-fi. Even though it's a shooting game, it is a story-driven game with over 15,000 characters of dialogue. It is a side-scroller Sci-fi shooting game with high resolution chibi characters that move fluidly across the screen! GAMESYSTEM We were able to add new elements into an established genre that is shooting games. ・Bombs, options, 'slow speed mode' and the grazing system are all elements we have incorporated from well-known Doujin shooting games. During 'slow speed mode', dual-firing the machine gun and gattling gun will increase their damage. ・Incorporating a 'HP Bar', which is pretty rare for classical shooting games. HP can be recovered via the use of items. ・Standard shots have a spreading effect. The further you are to the enemy, the weaker the damage. Enemies drop score-up items when you defeat them quickly. The key to scoring high is to fight close range while avoiding enemy attacks. ・Gamepad support is implemented for players who want more precise control over their character. ・Includes cute animated cut scenes for bomb explosions. This might mess with your focus, but for this instance, we prioritized pretty girls over the fluidity. CHARACTER Sion Obsidias Grew up in an orphanage. Enlisted in the 99th Aerial Battalion to fight Auto Drones. Second lieutenant. Has big breasts. Ruri Clerodendrum Thinks of Sion as a worthy rival, but that feeling doesn't seem to be mutual with Sion. Her close combat skills are unparalleled in the military. She looks and acts a lot younger than her age, so she's popular among her peers. Flat chested. Hudie Yue A bounty hunter who goes around destroying and salvaging parts from Auto Drones. She's one of the strongest Demi-humans out there, and handles heavy weaponry with ease. Huge breasts. Lycoris An artificial lifeform from Arcadia. She's not a great fighter, but she's able to control Auto Drones to some extent. Flat as a board. Elys An artificial lifeform with an incredibly high aptitude for combat. She's a prized and valuable fighter of the Church. Has big breasts.",
