    "About the game": "Welcome to the open world, mini-metroidvania of your dreams. You wake in a circle of speaking stones, in a strange sunless land filled with ruins and monsters. You remember going to sleep, back in your world, on a hill near the cresting lights. Some called it a faerie hill, and warned of kidnapping and dancing and taken to the land of the good folk, the grey folk, the faeries. But there are no fair folk here, it is empty and lonely and littered with hollow bones. You have only one thought: to return back home. But how? How. The experience is beautiful and immersive. Expect to get lost, and love finding the interesting places you discover. This game contains: -Non-linear layout. Defeat any boss in any order you like. Find any item in any order you like. Solve puzzles using whatever tools you have on hand. -No health bar. You fade away each time you get hit, until you completely disappear -Only two items. One for each hand, each time you want a new one, you have to drop an old one. This leads to interesting strategy and puzzle solving -You can pick up anything and use it as an item -Speed run and game challenge tools. Press escape, turn on the speed run timer or the kill count timer. Try beating the game with 0 kills! It's hard, but not impossible. Or beat the game with only 5 kills. Or 100! -Multiple different ways to solve each puzzle in the game. This allows players to find their own way. -A full Day/Night cycle -A weather cycle including fog, rain, overcast -Fifty four unique maps, creating a unique, miniature world -Four bosses. Three bosses hidden throughout the land and one final boss.",
