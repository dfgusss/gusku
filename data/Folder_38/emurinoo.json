    "About the game": "Inspired by Getting Over it, Emurinoo is a frustrating but rewarding platformer... Take control of an Emu (Ostrich?) by rotating each leg forward and backwards with arrow keys and WASD. It may take you some time to get the hang of things, trying to be fast isn't always the best approach! Many many hours of gameplay Play community made levels Compete in global leaderboards across all levels Scream, sigh, cry, smile, laugh, scream again (but a happy scream)",
