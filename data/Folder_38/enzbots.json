    "About the game": "ENZBOTS Created by one person, over 4 years. Easy to play, hard to master, massively re-playable. 2 player split screen fun, designed to put players, in a good mood. Can take 4 hours to fully complete. (Keep playing after the credits, 4th time around, is the hardest). Features 13 levels 6 mini-golf, pool table, soccer, fight area, 4 shooting, and 3d scan of my lounge room (studio,) for the load levels area. Early levels allow time for new players to get used to the characters controls, juggling weapons, shields, and dash while keeping an eye on the ball, trying to stay alive. Players share 4 different shaped characters, easily switched in-between, live in game, at any moment. (If player can master switching characters, then ENZBOTS can also be played by a skilled one player.) Simple pause menu has, music up down, save / load, and pitch invert. ENZBOTS will get the heart rate up, make you smile, and test your gaming ability. From beginners to experts ENZBOTS has challenged all, simple controls, but no button is left out. 'I have played ENZBOTS thousands of times while testing a building, and each time something different would happen. AI’s brains are so random that no two game plays are the same”. “…all my heart and soul went into ENZBOTS” ... Ian Gumby Mitchell, the creator.",
