    "About the game": "The goal of this game is to change all red objects to green, systematically clicking on them with the objective of solving the puzzle in the lowest number of moves possible. If you click on a green object, it becomes red, and the opposite is also true. Some levels have inverted controls, and others have moving objects Solutions are available in the Steam Guide. Feel free to consult it if any level becomes too difficult. Key features: 24 main levels and 20 bonus levels with different layouts; Random level generation (movable objects not available) , in which you can specify the desired height and width of the level from 2 to 7 respectively (2x7 possible); Create your own levels (without moving objects) with dimensions ranging from 2x2 to 7x7, and share them via clipboard code; You can draw lines anywhere on-screen with the right mouse button and erase them with the middle mouse button; Big buttons! Have you ever wondered how much time you lost by hovering over small buttons?; 100% made by me. Any bugs you may encounter can be fixed. (That huge tree of blueprints in the trailer is a randomly generated level without loops :D); Additionally, there are 2 minigames: the first is a memory game in which your goal is to remember the direction of a sequence of arrows, which will be infinitely generated. The second is hot seat competitive. Player 1 uses WASD keys and Player 2 uses arrows with the goal of changing as many on-screen objects to their color as possible in a limited amount of time. Double protection for the achievements. If 'wait for achievements' is enabled (see settings page), then the game will not save until the achievement is received. Achievements can be synchronized separately in individual menu. This will help prevent Steam crashes or glitches from bugging out achievements; The plot of this game will definitely not disappoint you, because there is none; No bugs. If you find a bug, I will immediately kick its ass and thank you for the report; Easter egg. If you find it, you can confidently call yourself a detective. :) More information is available in FAQs on the game's Steam forum. Thanks for help with store page translation to Havik.",
