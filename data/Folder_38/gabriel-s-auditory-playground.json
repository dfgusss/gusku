    "About the game": "Gabriel's Auditory Playground has no graphics, no visuals, no way to experience the gameplay with your eyes. In Gabriel's Auditory Playground, your eyes have no use. Put your ears to the test and play through a variety of mini-games designed without sight in mind such as: Zombie Survival - Survive an increasing amount of the living dead as you fend them off with nothing but your ears and a big, stinkin' gun. They're closing in from every direction, how many will you take down with you? Ninja Knockout - Ninjas to the left of you, more ninjas to the right, here you are, stuck in the middle with... two fists. In this mini-game inspired by 'One Finger Death Punch', get ready for a brutal beat-down and knockout limitless ninjas coming from either side! Not Enough Cooks - Put on your apron as a criminally underpaid fast food worker that's on their last warning. Get three orders wrong and you'll be back in the unemployment line! Can you survive your shift? In this mini-game inspired by 'Overcooked', build burgers to order in a very busy restaurant! Evasive Maneuvers - Pilot a fighter jet and shoot down enemy aircraft that are trying to launch a counter attack on you! Can you make it back to base? (Delayed until I can go to the airport and record the required audio!) And many more to come with your help! (See early access terms above.) Gabriel's Auditory Playground is an experimental game to raise awareness for visual impairment. As this is an early access title, all future updates are subject to change.
