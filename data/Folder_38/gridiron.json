    "About the game": "Gridiron is a fast-paced fusion of sci-fi and arcade-style American football in a stadium on the moon. Engage in a competitive multiplayer driven online experience featuring up to 7v7 in both casual and competitive online matches, private matches, offline practice mode, and more. Competitive Multiplayer Action With matches supporting up to 7v7, you can play with your friends or make new ones. Queue up for public matches or host private matches. Climb the ranks to become a Gridiron legend and earn season exclusive rewards! Free to Play Gridiron is free to play and never pay-to-win. Cosmetics are available for purchase and obtainable through gameplay, but have no effect on gameplay. Stats Leaderboards Gridiron has an extensive stats system and a public leaderboard for every position. Think you got what it takes to be a top 100 player? Chaosball Chaosball is a 3v3 game mode that takes all of the rules of football and throws them out of the space station. In Chaosball, anybody can catch and throw the ball at any point in the game. You can bounce the ball off of the ground or walls. You can catch your own passes. Oh, and this is all happening in low gravity. Here are some ground(or space I guess?) rules: You can bounce the ball up to 3 times before a pass is considered incomplete. The more you pass the ball, the higher your streak gets. The higher your streak, the more points a touchdown is worth. Touchdowns can be worth a maximum of 7 points. There is a pass clock. Hold onto the ball too long and it will explode!",
