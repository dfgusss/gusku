    "About the game": "Are you the kind of person that loves catching horror movie tropes while watching a new horror flick? Well then grab some friends, put on a movie, and prepare to get a Horror Movie Bingo! Horror Movie Bingo will generate a bingo card for each person watching - Instead of numbers, each space is its own horror movie trope, and your goal is to be the first player to notice enough of them to fill 5-in-a-row. All you need to do is provide the video! It's simple to use, easy to get into, and it's a great way to add a little something extra to the experience. And you can play using phones, tablets, or laptops! The game even works over a Zoom, so you can still enjoy it even if everyone can't be in the same space. Get it today and experience a new way to Bingo!",
