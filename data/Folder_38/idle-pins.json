    "About the game": "Tired of those incremental games where you have to buy the first highlighted upgrade without thinking? Do you enjoy the rewarding feeling after unlocking hard earned stuff? THIS-IS-YOUR-GAME! I've been working and updating this game in my free time, as a hobby, during the last two years. I want to thank the Discord community for their support and feedback. Hope you enjoy it. Fuse two Pins to get an improved and stronger version. Sometimes they will result in a completely new and different Pin! Plan your strategy. Add Pins into a formation, each Formation with its own spcial bonus, slots amount and slot types. Choose the best combination for each situation. Explore different locations. Each with their own enemies, materials, and drops. Advance through zones and maps to find new crafting blueprints and unlock new features! Tune and improve your attack Pins stats like their power and HP or even the chance of multihit! Can you get S+ Rank tunes on all the 11 stats? Follow the clues and unlock The Tower. Send expeditions to find new floors with randomized enemies and loot, keep the ones you like and build your own Tower! Of course there is a prestige mechanic! Start a new season and sacrifice some progress to unlock over 200 powerful upgrades. Over 250 different Pins to collect 25 different formations with their own bonuses to fit your Pins. Plan your strategy! 130+ enemies in 12 different zones 60+ crafting blueprints to unlock new Pins, features and QoL 70+ Trophies to boost game mechanics 170+ ingame achievements Prestige system and Black Market, together with 400+ upgrades and QoL stuff to unlock Master the Art of Alchemy to find new Pins Merge, tune, level up, dismantle, synthesize and much more. I already did too many spoilers :P",
