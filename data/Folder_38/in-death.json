    "About the game": "In Death's dream kingdom, Heaven is abandoned. Amongst its crumbling ruins, forsaken souls, angelic creatures and demons alike have run amok. Only a courageous hero that dares to venture deep into the Afterlife will be able to restore Harmony. A VR shooter with roguelike elements, In Death´s surreal medieval setting is presented in a procedurally generated world with monsters, mysteries and loot. Driven by an achievement-based progression system that advances between sessions, each run is unique, with unpredictable outcomes. Features and Highlights: A VR Shooter with Roguelike elements: Inspired by classic Roguelike dungeon crawlers, In Death pays homage to this merciless genre favoured by core gamers. With no save points, each procedurally generated run uses a random seed to generate the map with randomized enemy and loot spawn points. Game progression is driven by an achievement system that persists across each run and scales the difficulty level of the game in lockstep with your mastery of it. Ranged Combat, Perfected: Make intense kills with your longbow, while using your shield to both block ranged attacks or defend against short-range melee threats. Shield bash enemies threatening to swarm you and buy yourself precious time for that short-range headshot. Upgrade your bow with a host of special arrows gained by looting monsters, finding pick-ups or by visiting in-level Reliquaries where you can power up with a range of intense special arrows to help you blast through ever harsher enemy encounters. Unique locomotion system: In Death introduces an innovative, fresh movement system tailored for VR comfort and perfectly coupled with your fighting stance. Switch instantly from combat arrows to a magic teleport arrow to navigate anywhere you can shoot. If you prefer, throw the single-handed teleport shard to perform short strafes, dash around corners or quickly retreat from overwhelming opposition. And if you prefer free movement, In Death allows you to opt for a classic free movement style of navigation that layers onto the primary combat locomotion afforded by your teleport arrow and shard. The choice is yours. Global, Cross Platform Leaderboards &amp; Personal Stats: Fight your way to pole position on the global leaderboards, competing for placement in the all-time top 10 rankings or the 24 hour leaderboard. All VR players compete together, irrespective of their VR rig of choice. And track your own progress with statistics showing your current run stats against your personal best performance. Beautiful, Medieval Setting: Powered by Unreal Engine, In Death pushes the boundaries of visual performance in VR. Optimized to scale performance to take the best possible advantage of your PC, we strive to bring a high level of visual polish to your experience, with more to come as we progress through Early Access to Full Release. Convenience Settings for Your Playstyle (and Friends): Play right- or left handed, seated or standing, and with or without snap rotation depending on your sensor setup. And switch into Demo mode without sacrificing your progression if your friends want to jump in.",
