    "About the game": "IONIA™ is an hour-long single-player interactive story for all ages. Get up close with music-inspired creatures in a lush forest teeming with life. Discover music-based magic on your quest to save the Harpa, a mythical creature whose habitat is on the brink of destruction. Every purchase will benefit real-world wildlife, with 5% of proceeds going directly to the Steve &amp; Terri Irwin Foundation, Wildlife Warriors Worldwide. The Harpa is the heart and soul of the Ionian forest. With every tree felled and burned by the approaching Tritone army, her spirit weakens. You and your sister Allegra are Ionia’s brave new heroes, embarking on a quest to heal this mythical creature with the power of music before it’s too late. As you follow Allegra on her journey to save the Harpa, you’ll soon discover that your every action has an impact on the world around you. ROTU Entertainment is proud to support Wildlife Warriors USA Inc.
