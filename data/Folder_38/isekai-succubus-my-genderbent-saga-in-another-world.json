The two succubi he meets there are a handful, but Rinne’s natural disposition is that of a caring older brother, and he does his best to look after them. (Although it might be better to say 'older sister' instead.) Eleonora (Elena) The other succubus in Rinne’s party. Her personality is bright and cheerful to a fault. Without someone to stop her, she is the type to rush headlong into all sorts of troublesome situations, so make sure to keep an eye on her! Angelina(Ange) One of the succubi accompanying Rinne.
