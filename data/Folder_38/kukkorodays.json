In this love-adventure game set in Akihabara, you can enjoy living together with a lady knight. It's a little serious, a little sad, and a little sexy, but most of all, it's fun!

STORY The main character's mundane daily life is turned upside down when a certain woman appears in his life. One day, a magic circle suddenly appears in the main character's room, out of which materializes an injured woman holding a sword and clothed in knight's armor. This woman's name is 'Cattleya'.
