    "About the game": "An exciting, immersive puzzle platformer, 'Lectrovolt II' is a pixellated adventure about isolation, exploration and new beginnings. Deep in the rolling hills and clouded mountains of a land long forgotten, an plant invested remnant of a long-lost civilization has come to life, its centuries old rest has been disturbed. A software protocol, centuries old, has been re-activated and an artificial being, Lectrovolt, has been created. Explore and navigate the ruins of Erlis, from the military Core below the basement to the lofty Penthouse, solve intricate puzzles, upgrade Lectrovolt and charge larger and larger machinery to bring it to life, and fulfil your programming. Accompanied with a relaxing, deep soundtrack by Ketsa, a subversive secret lore and challenging achievements, 'Lectrovolt II' is the first ambitious Steam release by Harmonize Studios. ======== UPDATE 1.2.9 - CHARACTER CHANGE PATCH ======== In preparation for the FREE Outpost DLC, set to be released next year, Lectrovolt II has been updated with the new ability to change your Lectrovolt unit's colour! The original Electric Blue is available, along with Deep Red, Forest Green, Vibrant Pink and Lamplight Yellow, and an unlockable BLACKLIGHT LECTROVOLT unit, available upon completing the game! There are two new achievements available not yet displayed in the game; Charge an object using all five starting colours, and Complete saves 2/3 using the unlocked Blacklight Lectrovolt colour! There are some improvements to the game, based upon some user comments I have received. If while playing you find any bugs, please send me an email on , and I will fix them ASAP!",
