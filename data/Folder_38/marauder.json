    "About the game": "«Marauder» is a tactical strategy with RPG elements. The game is based on the book 'Marauder' by Berkem al Atomi and brings you to an alternate history where anarchy and endless strife have become a rule. You will play as a marauder who is trying to survive and settle a comfortable life. At first you have nothing but a double-barreled gun and a handful of shells, but in time you will gather 'a family', arm it, and learn to stay alive in this constant war of everything against everyone. Game script and character dialogues written by Berkem al Atomi himself. A full-blown RPG system to develop your squad members. A small Uralian town with various different locales for you to explore (ruins, forests, military bases, underground bunkers); flexible system of weapon customization and a great diversity of items for barter and survival equipment. Possibilities for tactical play and rich selection of combat situations – you will have to use stationary weapons, assault fortified buildings, operate at night, battle enemies indoors and outdoors and much more.",
