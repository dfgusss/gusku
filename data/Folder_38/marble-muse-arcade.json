    "About the game": "Object of the game In this fast paced, score attack marble game, collect as many stars as you can and touch the end platform before the time runs out and the course explodes! Guide your marble by tilting the course, sometimes completely upside down! Time bonus, hidden stars, multipliers and combos are all here! Can you collect enough points to achieve the coveted rank of LEGEND? Combos! Collect 10 stars in rapid succession to start a combo! You marble literally lights on fire. The combo doubles all your point collection including multipliers for 20 seconds! These are very valuable especially after you have built up a significant multiplier. Up to 2 players In a 2 player game, each player takes a turn. If they either fall off the course or the time runs out, they lose a life and the play moved to the next player. Once all the lives are gone, the game ends and your scores are displayed. The player with the highest score wins. Classic Arcade Style The inspiration for Marble Muse Arcade has been, of course, classic arcades. Games like Centipede or Marble Madness that use that giant trackball. In fact, this game was originally created and placed in an arcade machine to promote a local game festival. If you’d like to try out that classic arcade feel, the game has been setup to work with the default setup on an X-Arcade Tankstick With a Trackball. Six Levels There are just 6 levels in Marble Muse Arcade. This is intentional as many of the classic arcade games had a similar number. Each time you complete all 6, you will start back at the beginning, but the difficulty will be ramped up. Mastering each level will be critical in achieving those high scores, just like the classics! Marble Legend Award If you reach the Legend achievement, you have the opportunity to receive a 3D printed award! See the website for details. -muse-arcade/ Feature Overview Six mind-bending courses that repeat with greater difficulty and greater reward each round.
