    "About the game": "The previous work, 'Me and (My) Cat's Castle' is a jump action game that leads 'me' which changes state by including the onigiri in the mouth to the power spot 'Neko image' which is ahead of each stage which is a little challenging. When an onigiri is included in the mouth, it changes to a 'normal state' by chewing and swallowing the onigiris contained in the mouth. In 'Normal State', you can shoot shots and turn 'everyone' into onigiri, but you can't shoot in onigiri. In addition, 'everyone' that becomes a mistake when you touch it in the 'normal state' can also touch each other without making a mistake in the 'onigiri state'. It is important in this game world to switch between these two different states. What is the purpose of 'me' to endure pain many times and move forward? What is the true meaning of the message that 'cat' talks about? There may be an answer to the (true) ending. It is this work 'Me and (My) Cat's Castle X' that added a little more difficulty to such 'Me and (My) Cat's Castle'. While rebuilding the stage for the player who cleared the previous work, we added new elements, a new mode, and adjusted overall with an awareness of the ease of play. New Element: Collection Item 'Umbrella' 'Umbrella' was placed on each stage. There may be good things to collect. New Mode: Difficulty VeryEASY Almost all thorns in all stages will be disabled. Even if you are not good at action and puzzles, you can play and relax. Please use it as a practice of NORMAL mode. New Mode: Mode X Mode X unlocked under specific conditions. The fear of GAMEOVER strikes me.",
