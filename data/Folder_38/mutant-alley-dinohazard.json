    "About the game": "Mutant Alley: Dinohazard is a 2D and VR first person fantasy sex simulation and a complete remake of the original Mutant Alley: Do The Dinosaur. 2D AND VR SUPPORT The new interaction system will deliver an awesome experience on a 2D screen but is even more immersive when used with a VR* headset. NEW INTERACTION SYSTEM Instead of cycling through animation loops you can touch, lick, grab and penetrate the characters in any way you want by either using your mouse (2D) or your hands (VR*). MAXIMUM IMMERSION The characters will physically and verbally (voice acted) respond to your actions and will remember your previous performances. Sliding or penetrating certain body regions will even emulate friction and resistance. Further features are dynamic breathing, genitalia and accessoire physics, bulge grow during foreplay and lots more. CUSTOMIZATION Do you like to foreplay? How about some sexy accessoires for your partner? Mutant Alley comes with a rich set of options to customize your experience. ALL THE DETAILS Mutant Alley: Dinohazard uses Unitys HD Render Pipeline to bring you high quality graphics and effects which delivers a more realistic and atmospheric game experience. STAGE ACTIONS Explore the environment and find new ways to shape your experience, how about calling the Mutant Control Unit to have your partner tied up for you?",
