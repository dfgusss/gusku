    "About the game": "My zero trip is a nice animated clicker with an interesting ending. It is the meditative process of walking, humor and reasoning of the author. In the game, you need to accumulate 'potential', which is given for clicks. You can spend it on expanding your limits (storage capacity), on items from the store and improving them. Each item increases the potential gain per second. The game has an goal. I hope that the author's style of drawing, humor and thoughts will help you relax and have a good time. Have a good game!",
