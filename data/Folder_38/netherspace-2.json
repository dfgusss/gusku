    "About the game": "Continuing the tale of Enok and Istradarion, only a short time after their arrival in Altum-Mortus's proximity, the two heroes befriend their formerly believed enemies and join forces with two mystically powerful individuals. A, a Beyonder sorcerer with seemingly no peer in this universe in anything involving his art and Eleria that like Enok seems to be a chosen of many worlds herself.

And thus a new fantastic journey begins...",
