    "About the game": "In Taiwan, early 1954, an orphan was taken in by a temple. Upon overhearing of his past, he set out in the darkness of night on a 'fantastic journey' to find his relatives. Those at the temple were none the wiser. He grew from hiding from ghosts to fighting ghouls. During his journey, he uncovered a ghost town's past and shocking truths. Events are based on real people and history. The tale contains the blood, sweat, and tears of this land, along with a worldview in which the ghostly plane can be interacted with. Immerse yourself in a rich 3D action-adventure game with 3D third-person gameplay. Players will arm themselves as they traverse the thrilling atmosphere of a ghost town. • Gameplay demonstrating martial arts straight from modern practitioners and masters. State-of-the-art motion capture technology allows players to experience the true power of Taiwanese martial arts. • Spells are based on Taoist practices, reproduced digitally under the guidance of Taoist priests. • Solve unique puzzles and beat mini-games that combine elements of Taiwanese culture and religion, such as moon blocks and the Tao's divine bagua. • Take in a new musical style that merges oriental musical instruments with metal and electronic music. The soundtrack has been professionally produced to induce a movie-like enjoyment. • The haunted houses and temples within are real. The production team personally scouted these areas and conducted field investigations, experiencing many 'spiritual phenomena' along the way. • Support for multiple languages, including Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean, Russian, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. • Supports Windows",
