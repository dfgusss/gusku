    "About the game": "'Philgood' is a new 2D adventure/puzzle game. It stages a little character stucked in a white “line”  ! Why did this happen ? How to reach the end of this 'line' much more alive than it seems ... A reflection on the world for gamers who want to see further...! Behind an apparent simplicity lies a solid scenario, comparing the ideas, the point of views and criticisms of a Greek philosopher about his area (8th century BC), and the various abuses of our contemporary world with its socio-political-economic crises. Which shows there’s nothing new under the sun ... or almost ! A story filled of metaphors, mysteries and discoveries. An unknown entity sends you to look for the bars of infinity scattered in the different Empires. The only way for PhilGood to find his loved ones is to accept the challenge and follow the instructions given by this entity. Fight every enemy, solve every riddle in order to overcome obstacles and get a little closer to the “truth”. But at every moment, your life hangs by a thread ! Its various gameplay requires reflection, skills, a fighting spirit, water and breath savings, speed and restraint to find clues and hidden messages, and to decode and solve the puzzles. Another particularity of the game is the system of life reconstruction, especially resurrection in a parallel world, always well linked to the scenario. A system that allows the player never to be blocked while giving more variety. And a special mention for the original, interesting and even suprising soundtrack ! . . . .... And in the end, you believe you've seen everything, you believe you have all the keys. And if the Empires were to hide another reality. What is their true secret...!",
