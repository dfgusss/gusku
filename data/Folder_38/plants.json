    "About the game": "Plants is a nontraditional and nonviolent experience where you take control over a growing flower. Unwind and de-stress with the help of the calm music and serene environment. Your goal: enjoy the scenery and have a pleasant trip. Features - relaxing music - a stress relieving environment - family friendly content - full screen and windowed possibility - mute sound effects and/or music - day and night cycle - 6 flower body mutations Gameplay Plants is a single player game in which you first select a flower and then control the flower (upwards). Your friendly flower follows your mouse cursor at all times. That way you can guide it towards an item, while it leaves a trail of his own body behind. Flower movement uses energy, picking up water drops prevents running out of energy. When you are out of energy, the session ends. Update history This game was already available in other stores. The release here also brings a new update: v1.0.2. So while v1.0.1 was not available on Steam, here is a presentation of the changes from v1.0.1 to v1.0.2: Update v1.0.2 brings a lot of new things.
