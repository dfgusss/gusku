    "About the game": "Leadership in the world has reached an all-time low. From murderous dictators to compulsive lying demagogues who throw regular Twitter tantrums, things have gotten dangerously dumb, leading the people astray. One nation is taking a stand and leading the way to a brighter future. After years of unimaginable incompetence, the American people are demanding more from their leaders. A merit-based competition has emerged as the new and improved way of determining our nation's leaders. After being vetted for basic merit and contributions to the nation, including having all IRS records made public, the nominees enter into a specially designed course meant to test knowledge and decision-making under pressure. This is no pen and paper test, in an arguably unconventional way, the American people have been heard, and in addition to being tested on their knowledge, nominees will also be tested on their ability to wield a firearm. Regardless of their views on gun laws, the majority agree that they want a President who knows how to handle a gun. After all, if you cannot trust a President with a gun, you shouldn’t trust him or her to lead a nation. While the people still support the Secret Service, they don’t think someone should have to take a bullet for a leader that can protect himself and herself. The United States is currently seeking the best and brightest to lead this great country. Do you have what it takes to be President of the United States?",
