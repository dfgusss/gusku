    "About the game": "Project Hedra is an ambitious open-world low-poly RPG game. Inspired from games like CubeWorld, Minecraft and Diablo II, it aims to be an open-world RPG based around procedurally generated content, allowing for maximium replayability. Procedurally Generated Worlds In Project Hedra worlds are procedurally generated, meaning that worlds are virtually infinite and distinct of each other. This allows for an extreme amount of replayability since no world has the same characteristics as the previous one, this combined with the beautiful low-poly look of the world makes exploring an enjoyable part of the game. Classes &amp; Skill Trees Build your own character, choose to be a mage, warrior, an archer or a rogue. Level up to learn new skills and discover different ways of playing. Each class can specialize into other subclasses, providing unique skills and different gameplay styles. Items &amp; Crafting Find and collect over 100+ unique items. Gather raw materials and use them to craft more complex items that will help you in your journey through the world. Quests Quests are scattered around the world and depend on the environment &amp; location, allowing for extreme replayability. Complete them and obtain great rewards which will help you progress further.",
