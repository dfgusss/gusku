    "Release date": "Mar 8, 2018",
    "About the game": "RadianVR is a new vision for an old-school arcade-style puzzle game. Unlike conventional color-matching puzzle games, in RadianVR you manipulate rings of blocks made of realistic materials such at metals, fabrics, and tiles, in a puzzle that floats in front of you. The end result, especially when playing with dual inputs such as Oculus Touch, is one of feeling immersed in a real world while playing with a physical puzzle. With a wide range of special effects—such as locking, rainbow blocks and automatic flipping—the depth and difficulty increase as you play. It includes an arcade mode, a more relaxing 'infinite' mode, and a puzzle mode with 100 hand-crafted boards to solve in as few moves are possible. It will ship for Oculus, Vive, and PlayStationVR. A VR headset is *not* required, nor are controllers. You can play on a display with a mouse if you like.",
