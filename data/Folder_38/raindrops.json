    "About the game": "Raindrops is a stereo rhythm game, played with your mouse. Notes will be poured from both sides, and the sound will wave towards the direction of succesful hits. Move your mouse, click with both buttons, even scroll to take care of these notes. How to play Notes from the left side can be dealt with left clicks, and right side notes with right clicks. Small notes can be cleared without clicking. Hollow notes can be cleared by scrolling. Have a fresh experience with this unique-style rhythm game!",
