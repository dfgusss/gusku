    "About the game": "After falling in her dreams, Iris awakens in a nightmarish world. Immerse yourself into a tormenting REalM while a haunting soundscape mesmerizes your soul. Will you be able to help her find a way to escape? REalM Walk of Soul is a 2D surreal puzzle adventure that will take the you through a non-linear journey, full of bizarre abominations and indecipherable, mesmerizing mysteries. You will need to solve challenging puzzles to access new areas and unfold the story of Iris. The main inspirations are drawn from surreal horror indie game Yume Nikki as well as classics from the survival horror Golden Age, like Resident Evil and Silent Hill. Everything is there for a reason: Iris can't fight, so you must rely on other means to stay alive and make it back home. Defy your reasoning with mind breaking puzzles, they will punch you in the stomach and then raise you to heaven when you least expect them to. Explore a unique and bizarre world to find your way back home. Press quotes: 'The idea of taxing brain-teasers against such a delightfully creepy canvas is really appealing, and I want more.' - Sarah Leboeuf, Mashable 'Looks like a Tim Burton Myst Survival Game.' - Destin Legarie, IGN 'While the puzzles were challenging, they were not impossible. That is the beauty of Realm... With very little dialogue, it tells a clear and concise story that isn’t overburdened by cut-scenes and allows the player to become completely enveloped in it.' - Nika Howard, Geekly Inc",
