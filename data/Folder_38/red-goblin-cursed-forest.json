Meet interesting characters in a psychological adventure, solve puzzles and learn all about the story of Artuo, the knight who wants to be a wizard; Red, a fire goblin that was summoned by Artuo; Melchior, the wizard of dreams and his companions. Red Goblin takes inspiration from a host of old school retro platformers. With that in mind, you will die, a lot, and when you think you have mastered the game you will die again. However don't let that turn you off! Cause this game is not only beatable but offers secret powers that make the game experience a lot easier!
