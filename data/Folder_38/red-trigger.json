    "About the game": "Red Trigger is a First Person Shooter (FPS) Puzzle game, inspired by games like Portal , Antichamber , Superliminal , The Witness and more, but very much has its own identity. In Red Trigger , the main mechanic revolves around you shooting red blocks called Red Triggers. When you shoot a Red Trigger, it expands, and when you shoot it back, it retracts. However, you can only expand three Red Triggers at a time, so you must manage your energy wisely. You can either retract Red Triggers one at a time, or all at once. Be careful though, you don't want to do that while standing on an extended block over a deep, deep void below you! The Red Triggers are used in many different ways like making platforms, blocking lasers, holding doors open, powering systems, propelling yourself, inputting codes and more! You play as a computer virus called Red Trigger. Corrupt the computer system you're infiltrating! Beware, this won't be easy, as you'll need to do an escape sequence to return to safety as it crumbles! Red Trigger was a final student project made by Maxime Vézina, in Unreal Engine 4. It also won the prize of Choice of the Industry at ImagiNAD in May 2016, as well as Best Indie Game 2016 from Waiting4Players . The game lasts for about 40 minutes to 1 hour+, depending on the player. Since then, Maxime gained experience in the Triple-A Industry and founded his own indie studio, Bold Spirit Game Studio. The studio is currently making a direct sequel, Red Trigger 2 , which will be 10 times bigger than the original, much more complex and polished. Contrary to the first game, Red Trigger 2 not only has a big focus on gameplay, but also on storytelling. All the characters are fully voice-acted and are full of personality. The game will also be priced. Interested? Make sure to wishlist it now!",
