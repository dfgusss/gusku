    "About the game": "This package contains two games for the price of one : Opus 1 : Utopia - RPG Welcome to the world capital, flying and futuristic technopole Utopia. Investigation / investigation game where you have to find the terrorist who laid the bomb in the lab where the Eternity500 was designed. Investigate, travel by shuttle train via the statioport or by flying car through the city. Interrogate passers-by, cybernetic droids, robots or zonards by defeating the traps of the Mafia and its abuses. Visit incredible parallel worlds in Real / Semi-Real / Semi-Virtual or Full Virtual mode to restore the matrix variations from which the Matrix suffers. Opus 2 : The Era of Renewal Welcome to Utopia (one and the same nation 'the cited 'world', with only one is the same capital 'Utopia' international market major cities of the five continents.), vast flying technopole. In the distant future, we are in the era of Renewal, which follows the Cyberpunk era (which takes place in the near future) where the first happens opus from the game 'Utopia-RPG.' During the Cyber-punk era, the world sinks into a terrible decay (overcrowding, disasters ecological, natural and energy resources almost exhausted, malnutrition, ill-distributed wealth, gaps in social disparities, civil revolution, armed conflicts, etc.) and at the same time, the technology makes a giant leap in all areas of human knowledge (I-a, IT, medicine, cyborg, robotization, etc.) Following this, during the Renewal era, the world slowly rises from the ashes. Little by little, technological progress is such that ecological solutions are found for improve the lot of the earthly population. The world is slowly emerging from the deep coma in which he was immersed. Under the effect of global warming, most of the globe is fled underwater. (It is for this reason, moreover, that you can find that the adventure card contains many islets in the middle of the ocean ...) What is more, there is more or less in all fields, whether artistic, architectural, scientific, technological, etc. A return to style artistic ancient (future-ancient) or middle age fantastic (medieval-futuristic.) It is not necessarily yet very visible to our present time or even in the near future ... But in the more or less long term, we will get there. Some examples ... - The first electric cars no longer make noises. - Cars are flying and therefore less cars in the streets (see not at all.) - We are now designing farm buildings, several floors, to use fewer areas terrestrial, which leaves more room for trees and to vegetation. - Technologies are becoming more and more miniature, therefore invisible and soundproof, which makes think a little bit about techno-magic. - Dress fashion sometimes reminds us of a comeback in the past. - Energy resources have also changed (fossil fuels are becoming scarce, giving way to more ecological energies ...) - The buildings are becoming greener, asking building materials closer to the nature (wood-based building, building with walls floral, etc.) - Etc. Etc. These are just a few examples ... Between two attitudes, sometimes ravaged, sometimes rising from the ashes, the world has come to the era of Renewal and it is in this universe that play your game. Virtual Worlds In the near future, computers have been replaced by projection headsets which allow reconstruct everything the five senses can pretend to control machines remotely and project in a matrix in semi real, semi mode virtual or full virtual. Sometimes the virtual has implications for the world real and vice versa, so that it can cause disruption. It is therefore possible to walk in worlds virtual. The most common of them is a world fantastic medieval, which you can access to accomplish your mission. Some game tips : - Regularly save your game. - At level 1 some 'big monsters' are too difficult to fight. We must therefore flee (key 0 to return basic menu) while waiting to get stronger. - Bring a notebook and a pencil to take notes. Note which places have already been visited, etc. Content of the two games : - Over 100 Monsters - Several hundred objects, weapons and armor - About ten career levels - Many maps very well done - Forty puzzles - 4 Game Modes (Real, Semi-Real, Semi-Virtual, Virtual) - A hectic story, many hours of play.
