    "About the game": "Rencia is an action real time strategy game. Designed to be user friendly and easy to learn. Start by building a base. Soldiers will automatically spawn from their designated structures. While in commander mode, place the attack flag anywhere on the map, and your units will attack move there whenever they spawn. Upon reaching their destination they will guard the area. You can then choose to jump into the action yourself by spawning and swapping between one of three heroes in a top down shooter style. Three difficulties are available. Easy difficulty can be beaten by players even new to the genre. Medium difficulty is a nice starting point for most new players, particularly those who have experience in the genre. Hard difficulty provides a nice strategic challenge in commander mode, and an almost bullet hell like experience when playing as a hero. Players will need to learn how to use both the commander and heroes well to complete hard difficulty. Rencia Early Access features a 10 mission comedic story campaign taking approximately three to five hours to complete. There are also three short optional tutorial missions to help you learn the controls. Rencia is a continent consisting of four nations: The Union, Industria, Oshena, and Mythos. The Union and Industria are bitter rivals with competing ideologies. The Union strives to create a high quality of life and general equality among all of its citizens. Industria believes wealth should go to the most talented and productive of citizens. To the south, Mythos has tall mountains creating a natural border between them and the the two rivals, The Union and Industria. Mythos prides itself on seeking scientific knowledge, and has occasionally collaborated with the other countries. To the north, the aptly named Oshena is separated by a large ocean and consists of many islands. Oshena likes to keep itself isolated from the other countries and thus has built powerful defenses to keep others out. Oshena has been rumored to be a large cult. Long ago when all the nations were young, The Union and Industria competed fiercely over acquiring land. They clashed over the fertile land of Roslo creating history's first and only Lethal War. When the war ended, Roslo was transformed into a desert. The destruction and countless deaths disgusted both sides. A cease fire was created, and both nations vowed to never repeat this mistake. And yet both countries found themselves constantly arguing, their ideologies just too different. War broke out once again, but this time nonlethal force was used. Soldiers punched, kicked, and bit one another! But when a soldier was no longer able to fight, they were left alone so that they could be given medical treatment. The first Nonlethal War eventually ended, however new Nonlethal Wars reignite on a regular basis. Modern day wars are fought with instruments such as bean bag guns, and concussive rockets. Not much comes from these wars other than letting off steam. Via its spy network, news has reached The Union that Industria is developing a new weapon code named a WMD. This weapon will change war as we know it. Your mission is to lead an elite squad to seek out this weapon and destroy it.",
