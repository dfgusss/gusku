    "About the game": "A normal boy in his teens and his girlfriend from school. They discovered a strange phenomenon in the school library. As fans of the paranormal. They decide to solve the mystery. Trying to figure out what's going on. They learn that this anomaly only occurs in the boy. Is this a curse? Or something even scarier? This is my first game ever. I like the SCP story, etc. I had bought the book on which it is based, the game. And I decided to try to make a game.
