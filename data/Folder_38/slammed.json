    "About the game": "Turn a scripted steel-cage wrestling match into a real fight in this 250,000-word interactive novel! You've always dreamed of becoming pro wrestling's biggest star...but a wrestler's world is fraught with hardship and betrayal, in and out of the ring. Become a powerhouse, a technician, a high-flier, or focus on your promo skills. There's more than one road to success. But none of those roads will be easy. This is a world where your biggest fans are your harshest critics; where the front office is more dangerous than the squared circle; where friends can become enemies with a single heel turn; where, sometimes, the only way to win is to lose, spectacularly. This is professional wrestling. And you're about to change it, forever. Slammed! is an epic interactive professional-wrestling novel by Paolo Chikiamco, where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. There's never been a professional wrestling game like this, a game where the outcome of your final match, your choice of opponent, and your relationships affect the ending. When's the last time you played a pro-wrestling RPG with a 'kayfabe' stat?--or where your trash-talking 'promo' ability is as important as your core strength and wrestling technique? Enjoy a 250,000-word personal tale of friendship, competition, and revenge. Develop not only your physical abilities, but a favored wrestling style. Become a heroic face, or a villainous heel--or even turn heel. Turn a scripted match into a real fight--and vice versa. Decide when to keep kayfabe, and when to break it. Play as male or female, gay or straight.",
