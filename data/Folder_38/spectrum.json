    "About the game": "The last game on the Pretendo GameMan , Spectrum is a short puzzle platformer about sparks of color in a dull world. With over 100+ levels and too many secrets to count, Spectrum features an engaging categoric split between tight platforming and rapid, on-the-fly puzzle solving. Puzzles in Spectrum are challenges to utilize all of your colors effectively. Evade a missile by enabling a wall in front of it, or avoid a dangerous spike by disabling its color. Your active color can be swapped at any time to accomplish all sorts of tasks. This core mechanic is the founding principle for Spectrum. All other factors, levels, secrets, and interactions are designed around proper and creative use of your colors. Platforming in Spectrum is crafted to be precise and intuitive. It's necessary to keep momentum and make narrow, intentional jumps. Spectrum has systems in place to help make fluid movement easier, but still intricate and satisfying. Mis-inputs and buggy movement are a thing of the past; the only skill cap in Spectrum is the player's ability. Many other mechanics are thrown into the mix to make the base movement fresh and interesting as progression and mastery continues. Furthermore, Spectrum features: 100+ hand crafted levels to conquer and explore 5 main colors to unlock 8 sectors of 'campaign' levels Sectors of hidden optional levels A multitude of secrets hidden all over the place And a crown for the king of the Spectrum, in addition to other cosmetics To finish things out, here's what Spectrum doesn't feature: Floaty movement A deep story with many characters Lootboxes Quick-time events Water levels A 100-player battle royale mode",
