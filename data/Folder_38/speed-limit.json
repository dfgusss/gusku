    "About the game": "Speed Limit is a non-stop genre-warping arcade experience that never slows down. No cuts, no lapses in the chaos, Speed Limit is an old-school action extravaganza boiled down to its core elements: Hard. Fast. Addictive. As soon as you think you've learned how the game works, it changes to a completely different genre , taking you through the history of the golden arcade era. Fight through a nail-biting side-scrolling shooter , race to the finish in an explosive top-down car chase , take flight in a thrilling fake-3D dogfight , and expect the unexpected. Speed Limit seamlessly changes styles , transforms the gameplay, and offers new challenges the moment you feel comfortable. Running. Driving. Flying. Dying (many, many times!) - From the moment you click play to the moment you die, you are in control. And you will die. A lot. A thrilling genre-switching rollercoaster that will test the limits of your reflexes Unlockable endless mode No tweening, no skeletons: All graphics are hand-drawn frame-by-frame The flagship of the award-winning Gamechuck Arcade finally available on Steam and all consoles! A 40-minute soundtrack A 44-page artbook with texts about the game and its inspirations",
