    "About the game": "You can create your games without knowing how to draw and program! Do you think that you need professional knowledge to create a game? It's not true! In the SRPG Studio, SRPG basic system and various graphic materials are already prepared, so you don't have to do complicated things on your own. You can create your games just by setting up your original characters and scenarios! Other players can also enjoy playing your games! It is normal that you want to share your game with other people to play, not just for yourself. There is a function of 'Project Release' in the SRPG Studio. You can always output your created games as files with that function. In addition, you can distribute your games as paid games. You can use original materials! It’s such fun if you can use your original graphics or music in your games. In the SRPG Studio, not only graphics and music, fonts and videos can also be built into your games! Various functions satisfy advanced players! The SRPG Studio is a native application and optimized for Windows OS, so the game performance is incredibly fast. The JavaScript is chosen as a script language and you can build up your own unique game system. In addition, the file export function is equipped so you can easily develop games together with graphic designers or scenario writers etc. An array of materials is at your disposal on SRPG World! It's tough creating materials for your games all by yourself, right? That's where our official materials website SRPG World can help! You can download materials shared by other SRPG Studio users and use them in your games. Special thanks: Joshua Goodpaster (English native checker)",
