    "About the game": "Join Pixel as he quests through gaming history, teleporting across the most iconic video game systems of generations past. He’ll have to jump, dodge and play smart if he wants to survive all the traps, puzzles and enemies waiting to take him down at every turn. Move, think, jump or die is the motto Pixel must live by if he wants to unlock the next console on his historic journey. Enter into a living, playable museum of video game history: A museum that spans across three decades, featuring 19 historically inspired consoles and over 100 levels to conquer. A museum of sharp things, meanies and free falls - in which you will die. A lot. And the fun’s just getting started.
