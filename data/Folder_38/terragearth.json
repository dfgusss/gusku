    "About the game": "In the world suddenly captured by an unknown enemy devouring the surface of the planet and shedding toxic clouds, you are going to operate a unique aircraft assembled by survivors who unwillingly became colonists on their own planet. By carrying out the missions of the command center, you will have to find and destroy enemy structures, collect resources to repair and replenish weapons, defeat new and new enemies sector by sector and convey hope to return the lost world with every new victory. The game is built in a 2D side-scroller style, which many fans have come to take the fancy of, with the addition of 3D-environment elements which enhance the spectacularity of the game scenes. The game enjoys modern three-dimensional sound and multi-layered musical accent to make the game process brighter and more realistic.",
