    "About the game": "Key features every action in the editor is accompanied by squishy animations, from typing text, deleting things, pasting chunks of text and even saving the file. 4 characters respond to your actions and accompany everything that happens, from detonating your punctuation signs, to hitting the ui buttons with a hammer when you use keyboard shortcuts 5 animated highlighters to bring your notes to life! all effects are fully customizable and can be disabled individually this is a fully functional text editor that you can use to edit and write your notes, essays and much more supports almost all alphabets* * due to limitations of the engine we are using right to left text is not currently supported, making languages that use it awkward to type. This will be changed when the game engine we are using makes it possible.",
