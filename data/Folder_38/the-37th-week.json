    "About the game": "The 37th Week is a VR ONLY, independent, low-budget and experimental real-time VR FILM (i.e. not a game!). Features: &gt; A responsive VR movie that reacts to user movements and actions seamlessly and that lasts approx. 7-10 mins. &gt; The user always has full control over the point of view (from the fetus' side), without having to use any external controllers. &gt; Plot told via dialogues that take place outside the body, with all audio being directional. &gt; Director’s commentary available in-app as an on-demand feature (it appears at the end of the first run of the film). &gt; Selected for 7 film &amp; indie festivals. Director's statement: Birth and pregnancy are events full of magic, but also drama. Although all of us go through that part of life, no one is able to remember how it really was to be inside our mother’s womb. To which extent can fetuses experience what’s going on outside the womb? We wanted to explore the contrast between the calmness inherent in the womb and the complex reality that awaits outside.",
