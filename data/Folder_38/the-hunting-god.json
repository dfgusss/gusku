    "About the game": "The Hunting God is a short walking simulator in which you play as Nodens the hunting god and listen to what he has been through accompanied by a white wolf named Draiochta. It is a relaxing and atmospheric experience with two choices at the end. 'My name is Nodens, and I am the god of hunting on my isles. One day when I was traveling in the Forest of Banagher, I caught a glimpse of some nearby deer. However, they were not the only beings that caught my attention. A white wolf was nearing our mutual prey when a few mortals entered my canvas.' Nodens' journey will take you from Forest of Banagher to the Mountain of Bhollain. You will come across some statues which unravel various poetic and very short stories. With a nice story written by Simon Kolbe Strange and Stephanie Muscari, The Hunting God will make you have a relaxing experience for approximately an hour. Save progression: The game saves your progression at the beginning of each chapter. PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.",
