    "About the game": "The Legend of Pomodoro is a pomodoro tool and an RPG game driven by tomatoes. What Is The Pomodoro Technique? The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method invented by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by 5 minutes breaks. Each cycle is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato. Why The Legend of Pomodoro? It is the nature of the human mind to roam about and sneak away from work. The Legend of Pomodoro (TLOP) implements a pomodoro timer gamified by an idle game environment, it creates a buffer zone between your focus and the outer world to avoid either getting tired or procrastination. Being different from traditional idle games, TLOP doesn't interrupt you from time to time during a pomodoro cycle. You'll become a legend in the virtual world while being concentrated on your real life tasks. Does The Legend of Pomodoro Suit Me? The answer, most likely, is yes. To put it simply, gamification is everywhere. The practice of adding game-like elements to non-gaming environments improves engagement and boosts performance. Gamification lights up our brains. When you complete things, you get rewarded and win both in the gamified world and in your real life. TLOP is supposed to be a tool to help you to be productive with an entertaining experience. It helps you manage big goals by separating them into iterative and incremental steps. To practice the gamified technique in TLOP, you will: Decide on the tasks to be done Set the pomodoro timer Work on one task End work when the timer rings and take a rest, then go back to step 2 or pause TLOP has integrated the following features to keep this progress fun: Grow and harvest crops to earn in-app revenues when complete tasks Level up in-app items, characters, etc. with tomatoes, gold, and crystal earned from completed cycles Progress adventure, unlock new stories, achievements, and other stuff Be a hero and save the game world",
