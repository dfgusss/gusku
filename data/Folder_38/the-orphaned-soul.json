    "About the game": "A young girl, abandoned as an infant, goes on a search for her parents and identity in a dark fantasy world populated with foul beasts and nasty cuthroats. Her childhood was a happy one, for the most part. But as her 21st birthday approached, her heart had a mysterious void, and only finding out long-hidden secrets and who her birth parents are will fill the empty space in her soul. A Visual Novel/Adventure game where you control a young female protagonist, entering an unexplored and dangerous world, and making many decisions that have many different consequences. Unique painted art and UI, original music score, professional voice acting and atmospheric sound draw you into the experience. Original story and novel-quality writing make this a truly special adventure. A 'Life' system separates this from a traditional VN-type game. Randomized event 'rolls' and results make each playthrough unique. Tons of real choices and occurences influence the game. Make actual choices with branches that change how the game plays out. Easy to use UI makes the game a breeze to play. Help our young hero find her lineage and restore her soul today!",
