    "About the game": "The Spirit Underneath is a first-person horror game. Story: With no memory of how you got to where you are, you must find a way to escape hell and figure out why you were sent here. You keep coming across these letters that are slowly leading you to remember why you’re here, but who's leaving them? And why? You continuously hear demon voices around you, and things keep moving, but you look around and you’re the only one. After many of these letters, you come to realize a spirit has been leaving you the letters to remember. You don’t understand why, you’re terrified, but keep reminding yourself you need to get out of this place. Not until later will you come to remember that the spirit, and the reason it is leaving letters behind, is more personal than you thought. Are you prepared to visit the terrifying depths of hell to remember what it is that has brought you to here? Are you ready to remember your past, and take on the weight it carries? It combines horror, adventure, and survival elements creating a unique mix. Features: Living world Atmospheric soundtrack Creepy environment Unique story Multiple story paths (the choices you make will greatly affect the story)",
