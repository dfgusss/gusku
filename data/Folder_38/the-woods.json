    "About the game": "Lost deep in the woods - but not alone! After an accident you find yourself trapped in a dark forest while crossing the lines into the hunting grounds of a ruthless killer. In a mad rush against death and time, you realize a creepy dark secret lies in this place getting deeper into you much longer you stay inside the woods and drive you insane slowly. Everything that counts now is to escape no matter on which costs or to die a painful death in the hands of your pursuer - or whatever might catch you first. “The Woods” is a dynamic ambient psycho horror game, which lets the player experience a mad and insane rush about life or death and beyond the border of sanity. Horror fans can be excited about a procedurally generated scenario, decision-based gameplay, and a cold ambient, with a chance of a lot of creeps. Was this blurry shape in the fog game creeping around, a tree bending by the wind or worst, was it your tormentor? While the sounds and voices of the forest are pushing you forward, just pray that the crackling behind you is not a bad omen.",
