    "About the game": "Time, Space and Matter ( TSM ) is a new game from the creator of Blameless . It brings back a unique first-person experience of puzzle solving, this time through the manipulation with gravity in 3D space. Resemblance Some players might find a resemblance with Portal . However, unlike clones, TSM is an original game with original ideas and has, in fact, nothing to do with Portal, although it was a considerable influence. Features Logical 3D space navigation Both slow-paced progression and fast-paced action Freedom of approach in solving puzzles A lot of fun with gravity blasts Bonus content for completionists Disclaimer This game is no shovel-ware. It's development took over two years and was conceived by me in my spare time. Aside from selected songs and audio tracks, the game only contains original ideas and original assets.",
