    "About the game": "A unique puzzle ... a huge mad contraption to ponder over, made of upcycled things. Slowly and carefully work levers, pull cords, rotate wheels... observe the effects and deliberate, and gradually fathom its workings. Work-out how to work small parts of the bigger contraption and eventually figure-out how to use it all together to bake a loaf of bread. A tricky puzzle, but relax. Half an hour here, 10 minutes there...have a ponder and come back to it, sleep on it. TraptionBakery is made to amuse, baffle, perplex and interest you for weeks. TOP TIP: move the levers slowly ...and adjust your view to see anything the lever moves. When you're not in a puzzle solving mood just zoom-way-in, look around and marvel at all the crazy upcyclepunk things. This game was a four year labour of love: programming, and drawing hundreds of things for the contraption. Hardly any drawing is there just for show, most of it has a function. When you work-out how to bake bread then the simulation aspect of the game comes into play: you will be presented with a critique of how good your loaf was and you can improve your technique for better scores. Could you even become one of the elite few world-wide to achieve a Master Baker's Licence? (See achievements.) TraptionBakery can be played full screen, or in a smaller window. (TraptionBakery may work on computers with a slower than specified in the Minimum System Requirements but panning and zooming will be jerky.)",
