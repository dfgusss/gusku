    "About the game": "A Tribble in Trouble It's tough being a Tribble! You get caught on a ship doing what a Tribble does… eating all of their Quadrotriticale. And the Captain, in a fit of rage, beams you into the center of a nearby planet whose molten lava core is rising! It’s up to you to jump, climb and squish your way to safety as you face off against countless obstacles and treacherous enemies. The Underground Watch out for streams and pools of red hot lava! But also keep your eye out for Glommers that are ready to pounce on you whenever you get near. The Canyon Climb your way out of the underground and you reach the canyon. Now you'll go up against ferocious sandworms with spikes! The only time you can attack them is when they're turning. But be quick! The Jungle Next, you'll reach the jungle. Things get tougher as you'll have to watch out for poisonous vines, sharp toothed plant traps and alien apes that love nothing more than chasing and squishing Tribbles! The only way to stop an ape is to land on him when he's briefly trapped in the toothy plant trap! The Spaceship Clear the jungle and you'll be accidentally beamed back up to the ship that you started on. There you'll find a crew that's completely ready to greet you... with deadly phaser blasts!
