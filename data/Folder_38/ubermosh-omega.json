    "About the game": "UBERMOSH:OMEGA, the apex of Walter Machado's Cult Classic series UBERMOSH. The retro-hardcore topdown masterpiece was carefully crafted during 5 years of community feedback, carrying over 4k sprites, tribal drums, fuzzed guitars and flawless gameplay. The players can choose a Saint, tune it to fit their gameplay style and try to survive a gun-filled pit where you can cut bullets with swords, unleash havoc with psionic powers, and evade hells of projectiles. Each character is a love letter to ARCADE games, like Kore, inspired on classic shmup gameplay or Aya that calls for a progressive combo score beater. A hardboiled egg of the Brazilian underground game development scene and a Must-Buy for the finest tasted ARCADE enthusiasts!",
