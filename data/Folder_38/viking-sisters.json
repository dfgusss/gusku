    "About the game": "Long before modern day women shattered the glass ceiling, the Viking Sisters were showing evildoers what girl power is all about! Join the druid Helga and warrior Brunhilda on their quest to save the men of their village from the spells of a wicked Sorceress. Guide the sisters through an enchanted forest, over icy mountain peaks, and into Hell itself as they pursue the Sorceress to the ends of the Earth and beyond. Visit the dwarven kingdom to forge powerful weapons and then battle giants, scorpions, and other dark creatures. Finally, gather and produce the resources the sisters need for each step of their journey. Along the way, you'll unlock mini-games, use boosters that enhance your workers, and earn achievements that will stand as a testament to your skills. You'll also enjoy a world bursting with color, imagination, and magic. With Casual, Normal, and Expert game modes, everyone can enjoy this instant classic that shows girls do want to have fun, but they can also kick a little you-know-what when they have to! Key features: • Adventurous, fun-filled story! • Colorful worlds and amusing characters! • Simple but challenging gameplay! • Mini-games, hidden puzzle pieces and more! • An untimed mode for kids and casual players!",
