    "About the game": "We Are Definitely The Baddies is part of the CosmOS 9 bundle, a set of 9 puzzle games discovered on a mysterious, alien video game console drifting through outer space. We Are Definitely The Baddies is a tiny game with just a bunch of buildings to choose from and one single resource. Each run lasts 15 minutes, but keep in mind this isn't a game you will be playing for hours. The emperor is kicking you out of the planet. But that should worry an evil space overlord such as yourself. Build a huge factory, extract resources, fend off the locals, and escape with all you can grab before the deadline. Create a network of pipes and factories that are likely to be terrible for the environment but great for your pockets. Simple city builder that won't overwhelm you. Great for a few short sessions. Yes, you only care about profit and you are evil. Might be inspired by a well-known sci-fi world.",
