    "About the game": "World to the West is an action adventure game developed by Rain Games. It builds upon the universe of indie hit Teslagrad, which has been played by over 1.6 million people so far. World to the West is a pulpy, cartoony top down action adventure inspired by European adventure comics. Take control of four unique characters —Lumina the Teslamancer, Knaus the orphan, Miss Teri the mind bender and the gloriously mustachioed strongman, Lord Clonington—, each with their their own motivations, skills and interweaving storylines, as they seek to escape the dark shadow of an ancient prophecy. Travel trough corrupt colonies, lush jungles and frozen tundras, as you snoop through the secrets of a forgotten civilization. Be careful though. Nothing is ever what it seems. Will you join us in this journey to the West? Features Play as four heroes, each hailing from individual nations and possessing unique identities and abilities. Explore a vibrant world filled with characters who have their own helpful and not-so-helpful agendas. Experience seamless transitions between combat and puzzle solving that keep you on your toes. Face your enemies head-on with brute force, convince them to see things your way or avoid them altogether. It’s your call! Uncover secrets, more secrets and secrets inside secrets! Exploration is key to unveiling World to the West’s mysteries. Set in the Teslagrad universe: a standalone followup where you'll encounter both new and familiar faces. World to the West is available for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.",
