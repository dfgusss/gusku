    "About the game": "Features A Floating non Platformer Absolutely no platforms (which is really unusual for a platformer)! Fluid Difficulty Find the level of challenge that suits you with granular difficulty settings. The ability to set quick respawn points at any time means repeating frustrating sections is never required. Feel Good Dash into walls that reflect you. It feels really good and looks awesome! Did I mention there are no platforms? Reactive Soundscape A highly reactive and dynamic soundtrack thanks to Ynglet's custom and needlessly complicated music software. Doodles for days The hand drawn art style takes a fresh ‘illustrated’ approach, reminiscent of expressive doodles come to life. There’s lots of unusual creatures doing their own thing, making the world feel alive. 'I have made a lot of other games before like Knytt, Uurnog, and Affordable Space Adventures but I really hope you will like this game too!' - Nifflas",
