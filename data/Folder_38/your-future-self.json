    "About the game": "WARNING: This game contains flashing images. If you experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights then immediately discontinue use of this game and and consult your physician before resuming gameplay. You have been trapped in a time loop with your future self. They have committed a terrible crime in the near future, and the only way you can escape the loop is to convince them of the wrongness of their actions. As you progress in your conversation with your future self, it becomes very apparent that something is amiss. Someone is lying to you. The question is: who? And why? If you want to be free, make sure you figure out the truth. Think carefully. Think strategically. ...and good luck. Features Mind bending, yet personal story : You are stuck in a time loop with your future self, and are told you have to convince them they were wrong for a crime they committed in the near future. What was their crime? Who trapped you in this loop? And, most importantly, how can you escape? Gameplay mechanics as a puzzle : There is no tutorial. You need to be as convincing as possible when talking to your future self, but figuring out the mechanics of how to achieve this (and figuring out how the time loop affects gameplay) is a puzzle in itself, and an inherent part of the game's challenge. Unique aesthetics : The game visually harks back to the aesthetics of retro text adventures but repeatedly breaks out of genre norms to shock and surprise. Atmospheric soundtrack : Varied and memorable chiptune soundtrack. A moody, modern update on 8-bit soundtracks of old. Your Future Self is a 1-2 hour long story-driven experimental text adventure with unique conversational mechanics, time loop based gameplay, and a gripping, suspenseful, emotionally charged narrative that touches on politically important topics such as climate change, refugee crises, and mental illness. It harks back to the aesthetics of text-based adventure games whilst deliberately bending the genre into something unique.",
