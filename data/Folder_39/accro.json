    "About the game": "AccrO is a Full Acrobatic Quadcopter Simulator, with realistic flight behavior and complex physics simulation. A training tool for freestyle drone enthusiasts. AccrO is an acrobatic simulator, not an arcade-style game. There is no scoring system or step-by-step progression. Controlling a full acrobatic quadcopter will be as hard as in real life. To run the simulator, you will need a 4 Axis controller (USB remote controller, XBOX360 gamepad, or a 4-axis joystick) and at least a mid-level graphics card, please check the system requirements. From the drone community for the drone community, AccrO allows new pilots to improve muscular memory and try different setups. Hardboiled veterans can tweak flight controller rates and thrust-to-weight ratio matching their favorite quad, aiming to create new acrobatic tricks in a simulated environment. Welcome to AccrO!",
