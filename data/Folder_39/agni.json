    "About the game": "What is this world, vast and unknown? What is this mysterious cat looking for? You will explore biomes in rich and diverse landscapes, where each area offers unique visuals and music. Our worlds are randomly generated, so each adventure you make will be different and unique. Along the way, you'll come across items to pick up, and even surprises to download. The game's original music has randomized musical arrangements: each part launches a different overlay of melodic, harmonic and percussive elements. And each biome has its own arrangement, so put on your headphones and enjoy the adventure! AGNI is an easy game to play, with different difficulties for its environments for the more experienced gamers. To extend AGNI's experience, play the endless mode that unlocks in the middle of the adventure. There you will find magical items in the store to increase the fun and make the best score possible! Features: - three different environments - an infinite number of runs and music - endless mode with a store",
