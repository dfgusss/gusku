    "About the game": "AI Vendetta is a puzzle platformer game in which the player plays as Proto, a robot with the power to transform into three different forms. Each of these forms has its own distinctive set of abilities and gameplay feeling. Combine these powers to solve puzzles, manipulate the environment and take down hostile robots and defences. Unlock Proto’s powers and determine the fate of the world! You are Proto, an infiltration robot which is part of a series that was decommissioned for its overdeveloped Artificial Intelligence. You’ve re-awakened after decommission to find that you are not the only survivor of your series and your “friends” have their own plans for society. Can you unlock Proto’s abilities and shut down the operation in time? The game revolves around Proto and its ability to transform into three different forms. Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages, giving them their own unique gameplay feeling and usages. You’ll find that puzzle solving will often require multiple or even all of Proto’s forms and there might even be more than just one solution. You are completely free to change Proto’s form at any time, so play the game your way! Will you sneak past traps or blast through your enemies? • 3 Forms to play with, each with their own unique abilities and playstyle. Combat Blast through enemy defences using your rockets or lure them towards your traps. Stealth Sneak past your enemies and take out their traps using your laser ability. Utility Use your magnetic and quake powers to manipulate the environment and stun enemies. • 30 Hand-crafted levels, including 5 Boss battles, full of puzzles and challenges. • Discover Proto’s story and determine the fate of the world. • Play the game your way!",
