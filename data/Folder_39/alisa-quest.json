Story Brau Village is a small community where the people live in peace, blessed by the protection of the Five Spirit Jewels. These Jewels are manifestations of the spirits that governed the land since ancient times: the Red Spirit of Fire, the Yellow Spirit of Light, the Purple Spirit of Darkness, and the Green Spirit of Land. One day, bandits sneak into the village and steal the Spirit Jewels. Without them, the Spirits are no longer around to protect Brau Village and thus the Village Elder decides that someone must venture forth to track down the bandits and return the Five Spirit Jewels to their rightful place. Alisa is a young woman who is an apprentice mage who is training to become a full-fledged mage. Normally, an apprentice mage would travel into the forest surrounding the village to subdue monsters as their promotion test, but given the emergency befalling the village, it is decided that Alisa's retrieval of the Five Spirit Jewels will be her promotion test. With everyone's encouragement, Alisa sets forth on an adventure to retrieve the Five Spirit Jewels and bring back peace and tranquility to her village.
