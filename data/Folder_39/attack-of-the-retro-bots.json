They came from deep space, huge machines with an uncanny resemblance to the toys and sci fi robots of the 50s. Their saucers orbit the Earth, ready to destroy all humanity with an array of deadly super weapons. While most the Earth's military has been incapacitated, a small research lab has managed to hack the robot's teleporter units, and has transported you to one of their ships. Now you must destroy their super weapons before they charge up and annihilate the Earth.",
