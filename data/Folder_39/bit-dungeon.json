You find a sword in your cell and vow revenge against the beasts who took your friend - the quest to find your friend one and destroy the demons begins! bit Dungeon combines the randomized loot of Diablo and fast action combat of Zelda. Explore randomized dungeons and hack and slash your way through dangerous bosses. The difficultly increases as you become stronger and stronger. Build your character how you want with deadly passive abilities. Just like the classic quarter crunchers of old, if you die you lose everything and start all over. Can you make it to the end and save the day? Features Controller support, no auto attack. Large procedural dungeon generation, every time you play is different. Randomly generated items.
