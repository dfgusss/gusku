    "About the game": "Important: This is an active game. Be sure your play space is unobstructed and meets the requirements listed. Boost is an intense arcade action-sports game that will leave you joyously gasping for breath! With a focus on active play, a few rounds of Boost is sure to wake you up and get your blood pumping! Teleoperate your Luma-Jock in the 3rd Galactic Quadrant's finest arena. Use your Luma-shield to Thwonk the Booster Orb and keep the rally going as long as possible. Every four returns you'll achieve a Boost and the orb will increase its speed. Keep it up for long and you'll be rallying with your opponent at near relativistic velocities! Watch out for Mines as you leap and dive for survival. Mines have a reverse photon charge and will destroy your Luma-shield and the Orb on contact. Not to worry! Your Tele-gloves have a positive charge and you can use them to bat Mines out of the way. However, be warned that Mines will accumulate with every Boost and you'll need to keep their numbers low if you want to prevail.
