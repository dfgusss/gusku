    "About the game": "Bouncy Cube is an arcade game where you keep the balance of a cube on moving platforms. There are thorns at the top of the level and you cannot allow the cube to touch them, for this you need to balance between the platforms moving up. But some platforms also have thorns, some do not hold the cube for more than a few seconds, and some move it in different directions. Thus, you need to balance on the platforms for the maximum amount of time so that the cube stays in order.",
