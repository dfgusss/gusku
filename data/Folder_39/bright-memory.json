    "About the game": "Bright Memory is a lightning-fast fusion of the FPS and action genres, created by one-man development studio FYQD using Unreal Engine. Combine a wide variety of skills and abilities to unleash dazzling combo attacks. SRO (Supernatural Science Research Organization) agent Shelia's adventure is about to begin. This game depicts the maiden adventure of a woman named Shelia in the year 2020. The 1000-year-old relic swords known as 'Kanshou and Bakuya', discovered through SRO research, have been found to comprise a unique multilayered structure, containing a mysterious substance in their cores. This substance, known as the 'Soul of Jiu Xuan', possesses the ability to reanimate the dead. In an attempt to take possession of the substance, the 'SAI' - a massive terrorist organization controlling its own army - has used a cutting-edge piece of technology known as a 'Quantum Transporter' to infiltrate the SRO research facility and steal top-secret and incredibly dangerous data. To make matters worse, while attempting to calibrate coordinates on the Quantum Transporter, Shelia mistakenly activates the device, immediately transporting everyone in the vicinity to the Floating Island - an airborne continent near the North Pole, undisturbed in its slumber for over 1000 years. It is soon discovered that the various beasts and corpses of those who once populated the island have been reanimated by the 'Soul of Jiu Xuan', and they're coming for Shelia...
