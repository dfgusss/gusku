    "About the game": "Kill Your Friends! Grab a gun and be the last one standing in fast, frantic rounds. Play on over 30 stages with a variety of elements and unique mechanics. A unique modifier system will continuously stack modifiers which increase the chaos every round with new mechanics, effects, and items. Couch-Worthy Combat Play with up to 4 players locally as you ruin friendships to claim victory! Short rounds make for great party gameplay where you can hand off controllers to others. Also supports Steam Remote Play Together, where you can play with friends online. Piles Of Guns Featuring classic FPS staples like the pistol or AK-47 alongside weapons like the BOOMER, a 2d pixelated shotgun. Mix It Up In Classic Mode, you get to vote on modifiers which stack up and build the chaos of the game. And after several rounds of building chaos, you face off in a Ridiculous Round with a unique, bigger modifier. After this, all modifiers reset and you get to do it all over again. In Arcade mode, you get to choose all the stages, guns, and modifiers that you want to play with. Retro Revival Every stage is based off of a classic movie genre. Slash through your friends with katanas in the lush gardens of the Samurai area. Wallrun at ridiculous speeds through the totally rad Outrun area. Or drink potions in the Fantasy area for strong elemental powers with dangerous side-effects.",
