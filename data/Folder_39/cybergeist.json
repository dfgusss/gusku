    "About the game": "In a distant future humans will enhance themselves with robotic paraphernalia to make their lives longer, or just to be stronger. Our hero Cybergeist did that, but to survive. He got cheated, and now he is a living weapon of mass destruction. The cops of all the city are hunting down Cybergeist. Their goal: kill. So run and dodge them all over the endless highway. Collect the Burst Spheres until our hero gets full charged to activate the Burst Mode. In this mode Cybergeist is able to destroy everything on his path! Cybergeist is a twist on the classic game with the yellow hero afraid of ghosts. Referencing other classics in the process. Neon lights, big banners, terrible life. Cybergeist gets it all. A dark, and yet colorful, dystopic future. The game features great electronic beats from Peritune. A catchy sound that makes you thrill over the highway.",
