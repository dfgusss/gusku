    "About the game": "A colony spaceship has been thrown together with old, worn parts. The crew boots up the ship's artificial intelligence as they start the arduous journey to the red planet. You've awoken, AI. Can you keep your crew alive and survive the journey ahead? Take Fate into Your (Digital) Hands Design your own ship. Customize everything. Directly control the ship's systems, set alarms to get the crew's attention, and respond to emergencies. Will luck be enough? You will die, alone and drifting, in the dark. Brutal and Challenging Experience Deep mechanics Simple controls Responsive difficulty, always Hard Short sessions A single run takes less than half an hour, but success takes hours of mastery. If it comes at all. An Uncaring World Destination Ares is about losing power over time rather than gaining it. It's about the internal struggle instead of the external. There are no aliens or guns; just nonchalant blobs of water named Charlie. Discover hidden, branching story arcs with several endings, ponder the meaning of existence, panic as another system breaks down, and laugh at a crew that is woefully incompetent. Lose capability over time. You're no farmboy-turned-hero; play smarter, because you certainly won't get stronger.",
