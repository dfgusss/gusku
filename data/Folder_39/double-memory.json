    "About the game": "This is the Memory game that you won't be able to stop playing till you beat all 21 stages. The game sounds simple: Memorize the locations of cards then match card pairs. Yet as the number of cards increase in subsequent stages, you'll have to push your memory to make matches. Inspired by 1990's pre-rendered graphics and bulletin board games, Double memory focuses on casual gameplay and challenge. Every level is separated into three stages. After completing a warmup stage, you'll be faced with Limited Attempts. During Limited Attempts, three incorrect card matches will force you to try again. Don't worry, there are as many continues as you need. The goal is to concentrate and quickly memorize card locations. After beating a Limited Attempts stage, you'll move onto Timed Attempts. In a Timed Attempts stage, not only are you challenged with a maximum of two incorrect matches, but you also have only 25 seconds to complete all matches. The first few stages will be easy, but as more cards are introduced into the mix, Double Memory becomes a real challenge. You're invited to push your memory to its limits in...Double Memory.",
