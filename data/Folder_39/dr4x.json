Or you can be a Rat Pretender to the Rat Throne and unite the Rat People! Conquer the world! Destroy the world! Be the world (Seriously, have you ever wanted to play as the barbarians in Civ, you can do that here!) Be a goat! Be a cult trying to fight off the evil goats while summoning your dark lord! Or you can have a relatively normal strategy experience as a Kingdom in a (mostly) normal fantasy world trying to control the majority of the control points on the map! And much, much more! Notable Features Chaotic fast paced gameplay! Fully voiced single player campaign as a kingdom called the Red Empire fighting off the horrors invading their world! Highly customizable skirmish mode with nearly infinite possibilities! Asymmetric gameplay! Faction specific goals and win conditions! (And realm specific goals and win conditions!) Voice acted units! Unique and memorable OST! Many...dimensions to uncover. The Game DR4X has an in-depth skirmish customizer and numerous different ways to play!

Play in an evolving world, filling up with horrors and monsters if you don’t try to stop their spread, unique events and so on. Research powerful technologies to dominate your enemies! Before your enemies can learn to dominate you! Do you want to fight other empires? Or perhaps defeat the monsters infesting the realm. Or maybe even be the monsters infesting the realm! It is your choice! Buy DR4X now! It's also inspired by Doki Doki Literature Club and FNAF, but we recommend not thinking about that too much...",
