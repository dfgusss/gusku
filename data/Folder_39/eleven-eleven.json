    "About the game": "Their fates have been decided, but how you watch is up to you... With over 90 min of content to discover, Eleven Eleven is a groundbreaking entertainment experience that places you in the center of the story. Follow six main characters as they count down the final 11 minutes and 11 seconds before all life is extinguished on the island planet of Kairos Linea. Their only guarantee for survival is a transport ship that will launch just before the clock hits zero, taking whoever can get aboard to safety on a floating ark in the sky. Their stories unfold simultaneously, and using your HTC Vive or Oculus Touch controllers you manipulate navigate through time and space as their narratives play out in real-time. You can follow all the action in three unique ways: - Story Mode allows you to attach to a main character and then takes you on a guided journey through their narrative for a lean-back experience - Explore Mode lets you detach from the characters and free-roam the environment to find new perspectives, search for Easter eggs, and discover more clues and details about the story and world - Goddess Mode lets you dynamically shrink the entire map so you can watch all the action play out in miniature like a living diorama and trek through the world at an unprecedented scale Use these tools to watch all the stories from different perspectives and unlock the grand finale and learn the fates of all the interconnected characters in Eleven Eleven.",
