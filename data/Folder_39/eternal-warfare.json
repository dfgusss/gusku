    "About the game": "Eternal Warfare is a turn-based strategy and war game where you harvest resources, build an army, and then destroy your opponents! Starting with a single building, construct production facilities, advance your tech level, and then fight through land, sea and air, until you emerge victorious! Besides being turn based, playing online allows everyone to move at the same time creating a more dynamic experience where not just strategy matters but also your speed and initiative. Features: Immerse into a warfare world where outsmarting your opponent is the key to the victory. Harvest resources and expand your base. Unlock new weapons as you advance in the tech tree. Conquer land, sea and air. Single player campaigns, with special challenge and secret missions. Invasion game mode, where you have to protect your base from enemy attack waves. Custom skirmish battles. Multiple playable generals, each with different strengths and weaknesses. Up to 8 players per battle, local or online. Online play supports simultaneous turns and asynchronous multiplayer. Lots of battlefields to play. Built-in map editor to create your own battlefields and custom missions. Modding support, to customize the game as much you want. Playing online: Update: You can now connect directly throught Steam! Just make sure you tick the 'Use Steam Lobby' checkbox when hosting a server. This also allows sending join invites through Steam. If Steam servers are down or you want to directly connect for any other reason, use the steps below: Connecting directly: To host a server, first make sure you have forwarded the port 1254 on your router (you can specify a different port on server creation window if you like). This is necessary to allow people to join your game. Then give all others players your internet ip and the choosen port. If you want to make your server open to public tick the 'Broadcast to Master' checkbox, then anyone should be able to find your server through the server browser. Optionally , you can skip the port forwarding part and instead use a VPN software. All players have to join the same network, and use your VPN ip in the place of the internet ip. After all players have joined and ticked 'ready' simply press start. Good Luck and Have Fun!",
