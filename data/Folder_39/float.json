    "About the game": "Float is a software that allows you to display 3D models on your desktop, with Steam Workshop support. You can use it to make 3D models dance on the desktop, show your favorite game models, pictures and so on. Float provides a Unity plug-in that allows you to create and upload models to creative workshops through Unity3D. Float is now in 'Early Access'. Its functions are not perfect enough. There are still some problems to solve and features to be extended. So if you have any problems, or any suggestions and ideas, please contact me. Features in plan: More interactive effects, such as clicking on the character's body, gives different feedback. Add some mini desktop games. MMD dancing models. I would appreciate if you could help me translate Float, please send me email. My mail: 1534921818@qq.com",
