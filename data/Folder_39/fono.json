    "About the game": "Joey Vancouver from Arcade Watch playing Fono “Perfect puzzle type game, unique and colorful. 10/10 would recommend!” — LABPROFESS “Great concept, better execution.” — Tide Two “Great game, beautiful music and puzzle solving combined.” — sublimenonsense “Better than Cyberpunk 2077” — Corrupted Fed (gameplay) “Get it if you have leftover money” — tired boi Fono is a puzzle platformer that explores the question ‘What if everything was made of particles?’. Not only is every visual element in the game made of particle effects, all the game mechanics and puzzles are constructed around a principled use of particle systems and their interaction with the world. From basics, such as looking around and navigating your surroundings, through interacting with objects, to triggering simple mechanisms. Use your radar/lidar-like ability to uncover the world around you! If you finished the game, check out / for leaderboards and hall of fame.",
