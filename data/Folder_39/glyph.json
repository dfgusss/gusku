    "About the game": "Glyph is 'hard as nails,' pure and old-school platforming in modern dress. You don't level up or get bonuses; you get further by getting better. This game is all about the controls and the environment. Use both in combination to progress and do it at your own pace. For inspiration, tips and tricks, fresh content, competitions, and community visit the Glyph Discord server: Have fun! And see you there. The list: One-of-a-kind abilities and controls Route planning in open worlds Value for money at 80+ levels Explore and solve puzzles Customizable cosmetics Original soundtrack Pure platforming Refine your skill Time trials Demo ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Glyph: Easy to learn, difficult to master! “Glyph gives you a deep-felt sense of achievement.” “Thoughtful. Magical. It’s the kind of game they don’t make anymore.” “You will feel calm, challenged, and entirely swept away to a distant land. “ “The soundtrack? It’s mesmerizing.” Glyph is perfect for speedrunning, but every single one of the 80+ beautiful-but-tough levels contains secrets for you to uncover - if you can find them. That means the adventurous gamer has plenty of things to discover. And for those who crave adrenaline, Glyph ALSO offers 30 heart-thumping, controller-clenching time trials pushing you to develop your skills. It’s easy enough to leap, but can you land the jump? Try our demo or join the official Glyph community discord for tips, tricks, and weekly challenges! --&gt;",
