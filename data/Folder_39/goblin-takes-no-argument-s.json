Features of the game Place towers to destroy the goblins Upgrade towers to get even more powerful Sell towers to place even better towers Different types of goblins to make the game a little harder Controls Press 'R' on the keyboard to toggle visibillity of the towers range Right click on the mouse to sell towers at half the price Left click existing towers to upgrade - An upgrade is successful if the range indicator turns orange it cost twice as much as the base price of the towers",
