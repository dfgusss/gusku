LOOK AFTER YOUR CREW AND PREVENT A MUTINY AT ALL COSTS The Navy doesn't take lightly to having a crew mutiny onboard one of their vessels, its a career limiting move. Along the way, the player will be challenged with various tasks and tempted with targets of opportunity, whilst keeping the crew happy and not ending with a mutiny. OUT-THINK AND OUTPLAY YOUR OPPONENTS Multiplayer and Co-Op games will pit you against the AI and other human opponents. The player can command a British, Spanish, French or Portuguese Man-o-War, ruling the waves and clearing it of the enemy and pirates.",
