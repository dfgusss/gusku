Other players can capture the tower, which steals the tower away from the existing player. Kill Players Kill other players to gain XP, make it to the top of the leaderboard, and become the strongest player on the server! Team up with friends! Upgrade New Spells Each level you gain a skill point that can be used to unlock and upgrade new spells. Destroy Huts, Houses, Monsters, and World Bosses Huts and houses spawn NPCs. Kill the spawns to control where on the map XP is available. Kill monsters to gain XP. Stronger world bosses give a larger amount of XP. Quests Quests introduce the mechanics of the game, unlock abilities, and offer an alternative route to gain levels and XP. More Updates Coming Soon!
