    "About the game": "In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control... Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is hard to undo your mistakes... This is a game for people who don’t want to be given all the answers. A game for people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch what happens. Key Features Fully modeled genetics and evolution The behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics. How tall will a plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey? These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random mutations. Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer. Science to be Done What do all those genes actually do? How is the world score calculated? What does world efficiency even mean? Much like a real scientist you will need to investigate, analyse and work with other players to try and answer these questions. To help you along the way the game outputs data in xml files so you can really get your science on. Genetic Engineering Create your own genetically modified organisms, but be careful, once a genome has entered your ecosystem it may be hard to undo the damage ... and are you sure you really know what those genes do yet? Secrets to Discover Who is employing you to create this ecosystem? Why are they doing it? Why are you doing it? What are those targets for? The answers to these any many other questions are out there, you just need to work together and find them...",
