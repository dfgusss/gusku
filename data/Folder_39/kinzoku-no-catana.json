    "About the game": "This game is a Single-player ARPG. It does 'not' include multi-player. You go around exploring collecting things and doing quests only to realize you need to get better with saving every item for every encounter to not die and lose unsaved progress. WARNING: MUST PLAY WITH CONNECTED POWER FOR FULL FPS EXPERIENCE. IMPORTANT! START WITH POWER PLUGGED IN! Installation path is one folder before the zip folder so move the extracted files into that folder. Also rename the Kinzoku No Catana_Data to KinzokuNoCatana_Data. Delete the two spaces for it to work.",
