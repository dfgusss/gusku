    "About the game": "Blessed by the light, Soona is the last hope of Jiruho. With might and agility, she has to face the dark forces and traps of the Netherworld to save her people from the apocalypse. She will venture inside the city’s temples to recover the fragments of the sacred mirror. With each new shard, she will choose new powers, but nothing is free from consequences. Explore and discover the dark secrets of Jiruho in Lights Out, a 2D action-adventure platformer. LIGHTS OUT is a student project made in 15 weeks during the last trimester of a one-year program. It is the result of real-life production of 30 something students enrolled at Le Campus ADN, in Montreal (Quebec), Canada. Le Campus ADN is a publicly-funded vocational school dedicated to video game development. Every year, three groups are enroled in the programs the Campus delivers : Level Design, 3D Modeling, and 3D Animation for games. After learning the basics of their respective fields during the 2 first trimesters, they join forces during the third one to develop, from design to test, a complete playable game. The 2017-2018 class produced 2 games: Lights Out and Surge.",
