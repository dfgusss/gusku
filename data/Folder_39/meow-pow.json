    "About the game": "Meow Pow is an energetic, high-speed sports-ish game. With easy-to-understand controls and fluid, physics-driven movement, players dart around the arena as cats, slapping everything in sight. 1 - 4 players local matches, players can go up against the AI, friends, or both. The objective of Meow Pow is to get the ball into the other team's goal. The team with the most points at the end of 90 seconds wins. Players can grab the ball and bring it directly to the goal but will move at half speed while holding the ball. If the player is slapped by another player while holding the ball they will drop the ball. Slap the ball to move it forward, keep slapping the ball to keep making it go faster. Players can also dash, giving a short burst of speed forward to catch up to the action. Play around in 6 unique arenas. Each has a unique layout, theme, and bumpers. Bumpers bounce back anything that touches it. There are two kinds of bumpers, static and mobile. Static bumpers cannot be moved, mobile bumper move when slapped, or collided with.
