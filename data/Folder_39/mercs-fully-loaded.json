    "About the game": "• Mercs Fully Loaded is a TPS RPG • Start your career at Mercs-HQ as their newest recruit. • Help restore Mercs-HQ to its former glory • Equip yourself with the latest weapons from Mercs-HQ or go full fledge fisticuffs with your enemies. Either way, Mercs always get the job done. • Fight alongside your friends, face each other's enemies, even help out sporadically or just turn on each other. • When playing Co-op it's all about the freedom of choice. Waiting for your friend to gear up? No Problem, go work on your progress in the meantime without leaving the session. • Arcade games can be found just about anywhere around Mercs-HQ. You can unlock new arcade games by completing quests &amp; earn rewards every time you play. • Fight for survival in this endless 2D Hack N Slash. • Face countless foes while you slash your way to the top of this chaos-filled adventure. • Run as far as you can without falling on the traps along your path to glory. • Build the tallest tower in Merc Tower, the more accurate you are the higher you can build. • Change the look and feel of your character with new Exo-Shells, each one holds its own stats and performance upgrades. • Help the R&amp;D team out by completing specialized quests which can earn you new weapons, fighting skills &amp; new content around Mercs-HQ • Battle Tower is a simulated combat system, the system randomly decides the simulation location, objective &amp; reward. • Not happy with the random selection, Mercs can bypass settings by paying a little in-game currency to re-roll location, objective, or add rewards to the stack. • Fight in single-player or co-op with other Mercs! • Battle Towers is expandable with new objective types coming in the future!",
