Mike Dies is a challenging fast-paced platformer with dynamic brutal fatalities and a massive non-linear environment. After flying his spaceship into an asteroid field, Spaceman Mike finds himself fighting for survival against hostile aliens, a ruthless kingpin and his own personal demons. Haunted by his past and hunted by his enemies, can Mike escape in one piece? Run, jump and hover through over 300 levels of hand-crafted precision platforming! Dying is actually fun (we promise!), which is great, because you’re going to die a lot! Multiple endings! Unravel Mike’s dark history and discover his true fate! Epic boss encounters! Tons of secret areas! So many! Fully voice acted! Using a gamepad is highly recommended! Social Media Discord: Twitter: Facebook: Twitch:",
