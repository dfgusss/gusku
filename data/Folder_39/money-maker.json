    "About the game": "You wake in a simulation, unaware of how you got there. You meet S-E-C 400 - the game admin of the simulation who discloses that you only have two hours to complete the game. Failure will result in the exit closing forever. You are tasked with a basic mission - to earn as much Karn as possible. Ultimately, the more Karn per second you make, the more Karn you will have; and the more Karn you have, the higher the chance you will make it out alive. Purchase business's, properties, upgrades, and other in-game items to help you achieve your ultimate mission. Journey alone vast areas of virtual land, scattered through multiple dimensions seeking to be discovered by the next participant. Locate hidden items, complete challenges, and earn as much Karn as possible before the timer expires. Will you make it out alive? Money Maker includes: - Over two hours of interactive gameplay - Over 150+ purchases - 15 Achievements - Auto-save feature - In-game soundtrack, featuring multiple genre's of music to meet everyone's needs! - Mini-games / challenges - and many more! Future content may include: - Competitive mode - Additional purchases / locations to explore - VR Support Money Maker was an excellent game to develop. It serves its purpose to help pass over two hours of free time by engaging yourself in the mesmerizing thrill of earning cash (Karn). You get hooked, minutes within starting by wanting to know, 'whats next? and how far can I go?'. Money Maker features over two hours of game-play allowing you to venture through multiples areas, and discover all sorts of things to help you complete the game as soon as possible. However, don't expect the game to be an easy fly-by; You will most definitely run into some challenging moments to overcome. As an avid horror developer, developing horror for many years now; taking a break and creating something completely unique to me was definitely an experience I enjoyed. However, taking the time to cool-down from the horror genre has allowed me to come up with some great new ideas for the next horror! Thank you very much, everyone! and I will see you on release :) Stan.T",
