    "Name": "Monster Girl Island: Prologue",
    "Release date": "Jun 19, 2019",
    "About the game": "Overview Dragons, slimes, giant bugs, centaurs and more. This island is full of monsters and they are all... Oddly attractive!? From Elves to Kitsune; from Mermaids to Androids; myths and science fiction suddenly become a reality as you find yourself on this mysterious island. Will you uncover its secrets? Or perhaps you will attempt to get close to these Monster Girls ? Story and Characters You wake up on an island. You don't know how you arrived there. You quickly realize this island is inhabited, but its residents aren't normal people. In fact, they aren't human at all! As you meet the residents you learn that the mysteries go even further, these monstrous residents find themselves in the same situation as you. They also arrived to this island under strange circumstances, they actually come... From another world!? During Prologue you'll meet a variety of Monster Girls including a nekomata, mermaid, elves, slime, dragon, kitsune, arachne, and many more! Even more girls planned for future releases. Look forward to yuki onna, centaur, lamia, tree girl and more! Features Adventure based gameplay, feel free to explore the island! Fully 3D world and characters. Original Soundtrack Multiple dialogue choices and branching events. Costume Shop (no microtransactions here!) A smartphone with no signal. A good boy that likes apples. A bunch of crabs. And of course, you can get close to the girls. Information Prologue features roughly 1/3rd of the main story (individual girl's routes not taken into account). It serves as an introductory, standalone, experience before the final release of the game (that won't be free and won't be finished for a while). I've been working on Monster Girl Island for 3+ years, it's been a journey, but after much learning and many re-doings I finally think the game is polished enough for the public. What you see here is what you'll get in the full release, for the most part. So please look forward to Monster Girl Island if you enjoy this first part!",
