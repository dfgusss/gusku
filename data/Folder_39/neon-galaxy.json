    "About the game": "Neon Galaxy is an arcade style multiplayer twin stick shooter. There are modes for co-op and pvp. It supports up to 4 players, with controller and keyboard mouse. You can customize our ship's body, material and trail, and unlock new ships by getting achievements! Control your ship with the left joystick, aim with the right. Right trigger will fire your weapon, the a button will give you a speed boost. Alternatively you can use the WADS to emulate the left stick, arrows or mouse to emulate the right, right click or spacebar for boost, and left click or left CTRL to fire. This is a game I developed in college to play with my friends, I'd like you to be able to enjoy it too.",
