    "About the game": "Nephise is a short and atmospheric puzzle game with narration. It is a relaxing and mysterious experience especially with the help of its music. The narrator is an elder one, so it is like she is telling the player a story. While telling the story, she is also giving the player hints about the puzzles. Rotate the statues in right directions and ring the bell. Something will happen and you will have a path upon you. Wander around the enchanted forest and silver cave and collect red orbs. PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.",
