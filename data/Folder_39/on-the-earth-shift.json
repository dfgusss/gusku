    "About the game": "“On the Earth Shift :)' is a VR resource management game / romantic experience about doing your silly alien job while your silly alien fish friend watches. Your silly alien job is, as the title would imply, taking care of the Earth! It is your job to ensure that all aspects of Earth life flourish in perfect harmony, including global temperature, the horniess of the population, and the desire to dominate / submit to one another. However, alien management from Glorf-31 have their own ideas on how Earth should be managed, such as Snarglarff Sneet, obsessed with extracting value from Earth, Elgore Smankoff, who wishes to perform sick experiments on the planet, and Mire Oodle, who just wants a friend, along with many others. It is your job to accept or deny their requests, as the world’s fate hangs in the balance, Features include: -your alien superiors asking your bureaucratic permission on earth-changing decisions -your fish friend watching you do your job but more interested in watching the blurry television behind you -the earth outside your space ship, constantly rotating, sometimes exploding -VR! this is a VR game! -you have tentacles and they slap buttons -multiple endings depending on how well you keep the earth alive and if you make it to the end of your friend's monologue -good vibes",
