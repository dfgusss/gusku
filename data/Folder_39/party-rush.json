    "About the game": "A cynical RPG in which you must stop the onslaught of beings from other dimensions! Use their powers against them to save your world! Here we present, Party Rush!!, an RPG with great freedom in party making. The protagonist, Peppermint, only cries for help. 'Somebody help me!' And your trusty allies shall help you out. There are more than 100 different characters from other dimensions that will make your party unique in every way! Save your world with your favorite characters! Explorations can differ depending on which day of the week you're in. Even places that you think you've already explored might have different events and new characters to invite to your party. So take your time and explore every nook and cranny! Magic or power. Single attacks or area of effect attacks. Buffs or debuffs. There are even skills that can be used only when you have a specific combination of characters in your party. Organize your party the way you like to defeat powerful foes. But don't forget the MP cost of these useful skills. MP management is key in making your party a strong one. Engage in battles, explore the map, and experience the story. Until the day you save the world, enjoy the humorous and exciting life of a Party Maker! Note: Images are that of the game still in development and the contents are subject to change.",
