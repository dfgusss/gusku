    "About the game": "Welcome to Pickle Clicker, an incremental game just like cookie clicker, but instead of a clicking a cookie, you get to click on a pickle. Not only that, but as a cookie clicker copy, you get to buy auto and upgrade pickles to further enhance your pickle picking empire. But watch out! The more pickles you have, the more poglins eager to come and steal your pickles. Also the more you click, the higher level you get which means more pickles for you to receive. Later on I will add that along with other things I have in mind. All and all I hope to grow this sapling of a game and grow it into something I never thought I could accomplish. That's all I have and thank you for consideration.",
