    "About the game": "Prismatic Maze is my ongoing attempt to make an interesting maze game. In Prismatic Maze, maps are not pre-built or purely random, they are grown. Maps are seeded with Pigment creatures which grow larger over time like bacteria in a petri dish, filling their inside area with maze walls. Pigments bump up against each other, punch doors through to the other side and hide keys inside the bodies of their neighbors. Classic Mode In Classic Mode, you play as an agent of White and are tasked with bringing light to the Black Tower, which is hidden and locked away somewhere on the same map. You must find keys to unlock the doors barring your way, break into the domains of your neighbors, exploring to steal their seeds to unlock the Black Tower. Along the way, you can find items to assist you in your exploration as well as ingredients to build new maps with large and more complex mazes.",
