    "Name": "Retromancer",
    "Release date": "Jun 6, 2019",
    "About the game": "What would happen if an insane wizard set up shop on a cursed island and decided to blend the dark arts of necromancy and ... nostalgia ? They'd become a Retromancer. And you'd have to hunt them down; probably in some kind of intense, pixelated, twin stick shooter. Choose Your Champion Select one of four different characters to match your play style: Barbarian, Mage, Hunter, or Cleric, Arm Yourself Against the Madness Unlock weapon drops and permanent upgrades between games that enhance each character's strengths: mages get even more rapid fire, clerics get more blessings from their gods, hunters become even more deadly at range, and barbarians yell louder than ever before! Defy Death A unique death's door mechanic gives you a fighting chance to come back from the brink of death. Enlist Your Friends Grab up to three friends in the local 4-player co-op mode. Survive The Journey Battle through 30 stages spread across 6 areas: Endure a plague of locusts in the haunted woods, overthrow a cultist army in the ruins, surrender your sanity to the creatures of the Void, and kill the Retromancer.",
