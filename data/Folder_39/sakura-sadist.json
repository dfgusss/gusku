    "About the game": "Music student Azusa is completely obsessed with the campus queen, Matsubara Mamiko, and for good reason. Mamiko is beautiful, intelligent, compassionate… and completely out of Azusa’s league! Azusa has long since resigned herself to the cold, hard reality that Mamiko will never return her feelings, and she’s fine with it! At least, that’s what she tells herself – until she receives a text message one night from the mysterious ‘Venus’. Word around the campus is that Venus can use her perplexing powers to bring any two people together, irregardless of how incompatible they may seem. Before Venus will help Azusa, however, our heroine needs to prove her unyielding affection towards her crush. And how is Azusa going to do that…? She has to take a candid photograph of Mamiko’s panties, of course! Will Azusa succumb to Venus’ devilish temptations? Will Mamiko ever fall in love with her? Or are the rumors surrounding Venus complete and utter nonsense? No matter what happens, Azusa’s bound to have an exciting semester filled with intrigue, deception, and up-skirt photography! The heroine of the story. Azusa may be a student at the prestigious Victoria Academy of Music, but she doesn’t take her studies seriously. She would far rather stare at the cute girls in her local maid café than practice the cello. Azusa’s father is incredibly famous in the world of classical music, and Azusa has a lot to live up to. The professors at her university constantly compare Azusa to her father, much to our heroine’s chagrin, and she’d really rather be judged on her own merits than those of her father’s. Unfortunately, Azusa’s only positive qualities are her exuberant energy and her unerring optimism. Azusa’s childhood friend. Mari – or ‘Marilyn’ - has stood by Azusa’s side through thick and thin. Mari routinely waking Azusa up in the mornings, reminds her about impending deadlines, and helps Azusa study in the university library. Despite everything Mari does for Azusa, Azusa regards her as a bit of a nag, and wishes she would just lighten up a little. The object of Azusa’s affections, and the most beautiful girl on the school campus. Mamiko is something of a musical genius, who can play the piano, the clarinet, and the harp, but she never boasts about her great accomplishments. All the girls in the Victoria Academy want to be like Mamiko, all the boys wish she was their girlfriend, and vice versa. Unfortunately, Mamiko is simply too perfect, and most people are intimidated by her goddess-like demeanour. Though Mamiko has a large number of fans, she doesn’t have many friends... That is, until Azusa begins to pursue her. Features: join Azusa on her love quest available in English and in Chinese enjoy a cute and funny visual novel small choices influence your ending",
