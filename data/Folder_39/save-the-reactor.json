Every day the tasks become more and more difficult, work becomes more and more stressful, and the chair under you burns hotter and hotter. This small hardcore point-and-click simulator can improve your multitasking and stress resistance to the maximum level. Over 40 different panels with an original way of interaction (who said it would be easy?). Over 10 modifiers to make the game more complex if you find it too easy.",
