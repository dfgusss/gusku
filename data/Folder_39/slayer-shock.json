    "About the game": "From David Pittman ( Eldritch , NEON STRUCT ) and Minor Key Games ( Super Win the Game , Gunmetal Arcadia ), Slayer Shock is a role-playing shooter about hunting vampires in Nebraska. Operating from your headquarters at a college coffee shop, you take missions to patrol the streets, rescue captive humans, and weaken the undead threat. A team of fellow vampire slayers assists you from HQ, providing new weapons, skills, and research. With a format that lovingly recalls scripted television (missions are 'episodes', each campaign is a 'season'), Slayer Shock blends immersive first-person action, lightweight strategy, and procedural narrative into a uniquely thrilling experience. Assemble a team, hunt the vampires, and save your hometown!",
