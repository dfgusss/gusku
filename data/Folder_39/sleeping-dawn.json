    "About the game": "Sleeping Dawn is a first person survival horror game in which you will play as some kids who have awakened in a grotesque world populated by creatures, mirror of their deeper fears. Dive yourself into this purely dark atmosphere and fight to dominate your unconscious fears. Procedural maze Get ready to face this huge procedurally-made maze by looking for the exit. Each single game will be different from the previous one because, at your awakening, the maze will change all the paths. Losing your way is as easy as losing your companions. Splitting the group is never an easy choice, but sometimes it may be necessary. Keep in your mind where you are and be careful on each way you chose: even the right one is full of obstacles. Dark creatures and obscure presences will threaten your journey: facing them or avoiding them is your decision. You will have 4 tools: distribute them based on your play-style but use them with caution because each is a double edge weapon. Learn from the mistakes you make, keep your fears down, study your enemies and cooperate with your friends because your target is the same: manage to escape from this gloomy maze. Psychasthenia But remember... Time is your worst enemy: you have only few minutes to solve the mistery of the maze and find the exit.",
