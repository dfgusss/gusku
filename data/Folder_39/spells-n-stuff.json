    "About the game": "Spells 'n' Stuff Grab your wand and fly into battle in this magic arena FPS built exclusively for VR. You can cast spells with ease; simply swipe down with your wand to charge it and fire away. If you let go of your wand, it goes right back to your side for you to grab when you need. Avoid spells and air-attack your enemies by flying around, or throw a magic potion which teleports you to where it lands! Combine flying and teleporting to outwit your opponents. Features Multiplayer Battles: Either join a server from the list or create a private lobby to battle your friends. Bot Matches: Want to train on your own? Play matches against SpellBots! Types of Spells: Make use of different types of spells to beat your opponents. Either use the regular spell, the beam spell, the shotgun-like burst spell or the automatic-firing pip spell. Different Maps: Battle on a wizard's messy tabletop, in an enchanted forest, on a floating island or in an endlessly tall library! Having been re-released in Early Access, Spells 'n' Stuff will receive regular updates to evolve the gameplay and add more content based on player feedback.",
