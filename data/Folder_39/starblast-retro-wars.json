    "About the game": "WARNING! THIS GAME IS A LIVING SIEZURE! IF YOU OR A RELATIVE SHOW RISK OF HAVING EPILEPTIC SIEZURES, RUN AWAY! A twin-stick shooter where nothing has a defined color! Fly around the arena blasting away colorful enemies in 8 modes! Break your high-score! Feeling cramped? Some modes give you the bomb ability, which wipes the screen clean without negatively impacting you. Also, try using the dash mechanic to your advantage to rapidly reposition yourself. Deadline - you get 5 minutes with an infinite amount of lives. Death can still hinder you and break your odds of beating your best score. Mortality- the typical arcade experience. Pacifism- lure enemies into bombs that are randomly scattered around, then blow them up. Checkpoint- you have 10 levels with limited amounts of enemies. Make every kill count! Titans- some enemies are randomly chosen to take several hits to kill. As if that wasn't bad enough, they are also huge! Scorpion- you get a little laser trail that kills enemy on contact. Too bad you can't shoot. Superthermal- Test your ability to dodge while an endless pile of lasers are constantly shot at you. Impervious- 3 safe zones are randomly scattered around. You are only able to shoot while inside them. Unfortunately for you, lasers sometimes pierce them.",
