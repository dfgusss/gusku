    "About the game": "Tahul is a virtual reality experience based around a fictional lost world reminiscent of ancient, Moroccan culture and was created to highlight the winners of the SIGGRAPH 2020 VR Theater. In Tahul participants interact with an artifact that gives them control over the four elements from Arabic alchemy: fire, water, earth and air. These elements can be used to manipulate the virtual environment and provide participants new to VR with a learning experience. Tahul culminates with previews of this year’s Selection.",
