    "About the game": "Take care of the intergalactic flora and fauna on a puzzling space station. Program TENDY, ROBOT GARDENER, to complete sets of tasks left to you by the station's mysterious creators. This short n' weird game takes around 2 hours to complete. Plan and send instructions to TENDY, a gardening robot on an abandoned space station - your outbound messages will only have minimal semantic decay over the massive interstellar distance! Lock down high-priority instructions to ensure they are sent to TENDY unaltered. Choose to accomplish (or leave undone) sets of location-specific tasks assigned by the station's creators. Explore the 9x∞ Project's three-pronged space station and solve puzzles to unlock new areas. Discover the favorite treat of the photosynthetic noodle-bear, Udonn. Help 'That Cat' find their favorite lost item. Play through the station's 15 strange stages and enjoy a puzzling experience that doesn't overstay its welcome. Dig deeper and scour the instructions left to you by the creators of the station to discover their true motivations. Choose to activate the 9x∞ Project's plan or find your own meaning on the station. TENDY: Robot Gardener is part of the CosmOS 9 bundle, a set of 9 puzzle games discovered on a mysterious video game console drifting in outer space.",
