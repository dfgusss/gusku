    "About the game": "ARE YOU READY TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM AN ALIEN INVASION? An intergalactic fleet reigned by a dark entity invades Earth and you must fight for your life. Be ready, because this is a 3D first-person virtual reality shooter, and the foes will be coming from everywhere, out of nowhere, even behind you so… watch your back! Wake up the hero inside you while discovering who The Last from Mars is. GET READY TO MEET YOUR NEW ENEMIES Ancient civilizations are scattered throughout the galaxy. They have the most unusual and functional lifeforms. Some are huge and have brutal strength, others are tiny and crawl for resources. There are those who are swift and threatening, chances are you’ll hear them before you see them. Although many of us suspect alien life exists, the ones who say it out loud are thought as crazy, conspirators, or paranoid. Someone, in a far corner of the universe, was aware of their existence and manipulated them to do its bidding. This sovereign of shadows curbed them using orbs as a decoy in the form of an offering, making them his subjects. These orbs are attached to their bodies and force them to do their will. Now, these alien puppets have assembled into their own intergalactic order to carry out their sinister plans GET ORBS AND SAVE THE WORLD! The player begins the game with a simple laser gun, the ability to teleport, and slow-time. Aliens enter from outside the playable map, and as the rounds progress, difficulty increases. As players fight the aliens, they receive orbs. These orbs are used to upgrade weapons and hire perks. Other perks, called drops, have a chance to only be dropped after an alien is killed. ARE YOU PREPARED ENOUGH? Strategy is key in order to survive. You must think about every move you make, sharpen your reflexes, and be prepared.
