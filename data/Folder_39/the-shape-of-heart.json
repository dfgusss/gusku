    "About the game": "_________________________________________ Warning This game only supports 64 bit operating systems. ---------------------------------------------------------- is a storytelling-based puzzle game that tries to wake you up from the numbness of life. Game Features: Amazing puzzle solving based on fluid physics A memoir brings you back to childhood. A diary shares our feelings in games, dreams, growing up, fighting with stress, and so forth Fantastic background music and sound efforts that immerse you in your memories. Easter eggs in honor of many classics Gameplay Solve puzzles by leveraging of an advanced fluid physics algorism Fill containers with proper fluids to open certain pathways. Activate water pumps to guide the fluids to reach places that are hard reach Solve the most challenging puzzles to complete achievements; make choices to progress to different endings. Experience childhood games with different designs and new mechanisms Each episode tells a story in a unique period of life, the choices you make will affect the plots in the following episodes. This game uses 2D fluid physics to describe growing up stories of the main character. We have split the whole story to 5-6 episodes. The prologue starts in 2016, when the main character just get back home from work and too tired to play any games. He started to rethink where his passions are gone. Then he starts to recall his childhood memories. The next episodes are about his memories in different periods of life. Episode One describes a timeline when he was born in the 1980s, he had a brilliant childhood, and grew up little by little. The next episodes are about his memories in the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. At the end, the memory ends and he wakes up in reality. In each episode, the player would have to make some side choices, which will affect side plots in the follow-up episodes. Because the whole game focuses on storytelling, we have to make some restrictions on the puzzle solving and level designing parts. Our purpose is to bring players a continuous gaming experience, without being interrupted by some puzzles. But don’t think the game is easy. We have placed all the hard parts on the side choices. This is just the same as life itself. One who chooses a special path always pays more than those choose an ordinary path. If you think you are special, try to make your own choices. Why we choose to release the game based on episodes? The game adopts a relatively new gameplay mode. We hope to bring our creative works to more players, and paying by episodes would lower the doorsill for many players who want to experience the game. We will continue to update new contents free of charge in the Early Access phase . After the game is formally released, we will release more DLCs which will require a certain price. If players don’t like any of the new DLCs, they can choose not to buy them. If players still looking forward to more contents, then they could pay a relatively little money to enjoy the game and support independent studios like us. We totally understand that games like The Shape of Heart, which gives only a few hours of gameplay, are not quite supported by the Steam refund system. But we are confident that even if you complete the game within two hours, you could feel the sincerity of our developers. The game still has much to optimize, and we are trying our best. We hope the new episodes and new games will be better with your support. Thank you again! Facebook:",
