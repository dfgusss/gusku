    "About the game": "It’s time for time travel! Master the complexities of fourth dimensional thinking to succeed in this indie 2d puzzle game. Utilizing time machines that take you back to the start time of the level, you’ll need to plan your actions so that your future self can work with your past selves to overcome a variety of challenges. The base mechanics are simple, but their implications are immense. Reasons to purchase You enjoy mind-bending puzzle games You want to become certified in the operation of a time machine Temporal-linear causality is for suckers Future-you may own this game; by not purchasing it, you may cause a space-time paradox and destroy the universe. Are you really willing to take that risk? Reasons not to purchase You dislike puzzle games and/or fourth dimensional thinking You’re a time traveler from the future, stranded in the present by a broken flux capacitor, and the mere thought of time travel makes you rue your cursed plight You hate the universe, and secretly hope your ignorance of time travel will eventually result in a space-time paradox, destroying everything Early access: I want your feedback, especially regarding clarity and difficulty.
