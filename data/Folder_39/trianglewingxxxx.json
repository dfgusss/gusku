    "About the game": "This is a STG game. Player need to switch back and forth in 7 modes to survive in the randomly generated enemies' attack. How to Play: Firing bullets will cost normal energy or special energy. Normal energy can recover gradually and special Energy can only recover by firing in specified mode or dodging. When normal energy runs out, TriangleWing can not move or fire bullets for 3 seconds, and when special energy runs out, TriangleWing can not switch for 3 seconds. So it's fatal to run out of energy. ****** The seven modes of TriangleWing include attack, recovery/heal and special functions. Special functions include using special energy to resist damage, dodging and firing lasers that ignore enemies' armor. ****** Like other games, you need to defeat the common enemies before you can fight boss. It can be difficult for players who don't like to switch forms or always run out of the energy to defeat Randomly generated enemies with a large number. But you can skip all the normal enemies if you successfully meet the boss more than 3 times in a row. The boss in each stage has completely different style. Story: Find the clues in the simple and even strange story. And Finally break the enemy.",
