    "About the game": "IMPORTANT: UFS VR owners can't play together with UFS VR DLC owners! *** PLEASE CHECK THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE YOU BUY THE GAME *** Warning! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator the fish are biting like crazy. We guarantee that you’ll never fall asleep. Ultimate Fishing Simulator is a comprehensive fishing simulator which allows using various techniques, in different places around the world and most importantly, you don’t need a permanent connection to the Internet for it. If you are bored of waiting for fish to take and falling asleep in front of the computer, this means that you have played a bad game! In the Ultimate Fishing Simulator this will never happen. Select the appropriate equipment and bait, cast your line and wait for a bite. Success is guaranteed. In addition to traditional fishing techniques, in Ultimate Fishing Simulator you’ll also find a winter map where you will be able to go ice fishing! Buy an auger at the store, find a suitable location and drill an airhole. But not too small, so that you can remove the fish. There are two modes of difficulties in the Ultimate Fishing Simulator, thanks to which there is something for everyone. Normal Mode allows you to enjoy the game in all its glory. In normal mode, all the features in the game are included. Realistic Mode requires more patience and efficiency from the player. Fish will be biting less and will fight longer. Some of the game features in this mode are disabled, such as the underwater camera. Every fisherman likes to admire his trophies. Some release their fish, other stuff and hang them on their walls. In Ultimate Fishing Simulator you can exactly do the same! Decide yourself what you want to do with the fish you catch. Sell? Release? Stuff? The choice is yours. If the maps available in the game bore you, you can create your own. Be creative and build your own dream fishery that you can share other players thanks to the built-in level editor. Enjoy fishing with your friends on your favorite, family fishery. What more could you ask for? Everybody likes to use brand-name equipment, which very often differentiates from the competition with its parameters and appearance. We are the only fishing game that has a license for SAKURA equipment (SERT S.A.S.). You will find in our game their rods, reels, baits and lines. Each item has been mapped in detail and added to the game. * connection to the Internet is required to play the game in multiplayer mode.",
