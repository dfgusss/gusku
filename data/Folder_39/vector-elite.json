    "About the game": "Vector Elite A calculated, precision-based puzzle shooter designed to be played on VR headsets but can also be played with mouse and keyboard and has full controller support. Visualize your surroundings and determine the best shot to take at the most effective angle. Place portals to cut a more direct path to your target and make your shot even more unprecedented. With multiple level types and a different challenge presented in each one, you'll always be on the lookout for the best solution so you can achieve your highscore. Use Portals to Your Advantage Do portals make things simpler or more complicated? Either way, you have them so why not use them to cut a path right to your target and hit them in the most direct way imaginable. Or overcomplicate your shot and use a portal to pull off the most ridiculous trickshot you can think of. The possibilities are endless when you have the power to cut a hole in reality itself. Current Challenges You'll be Facing Try the 'buttons' levels where some targets will be locked behind an impenetrable forcefield and the only way to remove it is by hitting a button. Or try the 'lights out' levels where it might be a little more difficult to see what your objective might be. Use your flashlight to get your bearings. More planned features and level types are coming as well. Designed for VR, Playable Without While playable without a headset, an even greater experience can be achieved in VR where there is more visual freedom and immersion. Feel even more in control in VR where making a precision shot bounce toward your target grants even more satisfying victories.",
