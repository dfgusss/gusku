    "About the game": "We have over 20 publishers lined up to join the VERSUS game. All of the characters come with unique characteristics. We have the Super types, Magic characters and even Street Fighters. The most important aspect of these characters is that the publishers are all independent. If you are a fan of indie, or just enjoy fighting games, then Versus is for you. Story We've been taught that there are multiple universes; that time and space is infinite, carrying with it unlimited alternate realities. But that is not true. Time and space is in danger of collapsing. In order to fix itself, the Universe has released Alpha and she is tasked with the responsibility of destroying alternate realities to save space. So she created a tournament where the strongest fighters from different realities can compete. After you beat the characters, you move on to fight for your final seat in the universe. The battle for space and time can begin. FEATURES 3D Fighting Game Versus is influenced by classic games such as Marvel Vs Capcom, Mortal Kombat and Streetfighter. Starting with 4 Unique fighters hailing from 4 Indie Comicbooks Each character has special abilities that can be used to turn the tide of battle.
