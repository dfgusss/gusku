    "About the game": "In the late 21st century, the world's civilizations are wiped out by a series of nuclear strikes, seemingly caused by a massive malfunction of the new NASDA (North American Strategic Defense Agency) strategic defense system. While most of the survivors form scavenger bands to survive, you are a member of a group named 'The Project', that is more organised and seeks to rebuild civilization using pre-war technology. Compared to other real-time strategy games, Warzone 2100 has a greater focus on artillery, radar, and counter-battery technologies, more frequent in-game cinematic updates as game play progresses, a massive research tree, as well as a vehicle design system. Features * Fully open source * Single player campaign with full FMV support * Single player skirmish modes * An extensive tech tree with over 400 different technologies * A vehicle design system Notes: To play multiplayer online port 2100 needs to be fowarded.
