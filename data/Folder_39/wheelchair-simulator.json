    "About the game": "We created this game to help real-world wheelchair users here, in Ukraine, where accessible infrastructure is still something to be desired. Profits from the game are donated to charity! Have I seen this game before? This is a non-VR version of the « Wheelchair Simulator VR ». Put yourself in other people’s shoes (or, in this particular case, a wheelchair) even without buying the expensive VR helmet! So what's new? We completely remade the controls and made the game even more challenging. Also we added new mechanics, unexpected obstacles, and a whole new bonus level, but the heart of the game - its true story, remained intact. Features: True story and interactive narration The story is written and voiced by Dmytro Schebetyuk who suffered spinal injury that bound him to wheelchair but hasn’t stopped him from having a full life. He shares his thoughts, cracks jokes and sarcastically comments on your actions and failings. Comedic gameplay Don’t worry, no one will get hurt while playing the game. Expect a lot of spectacular fails though! Customization and replayability Want a Hot Rod wheelchair? Gather in-game coins and finish the levels as fast as you can! Also try to fnd some Easter eggs like Duck Souls mode inside the game. Charity cause Profits from the game are donated to Dostupno UA initiative (search dostupnoukraine on Facebook) which supports accessibility programs and films video blogs about infrastructure and life of people with disabilities in Ukraine.",
