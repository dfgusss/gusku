    "About the game": "XOXO Blood Droplets is an absurd, dark comedy, twisted romance Visual Novel about terrible things happening to terrible people. The fun comes not from avoiding the potential horrors, but by seeing just how many ways things can go wrong. ♡ 3 Insane Suitors- Jeremy King, Bae Pyoun, and Everett Gray ♡ 3 Separate Storylines ♡ 50,000 words ♡ 42 Endings!- Some of them are actually okay. Most are not ♡ 18 CGs + a unique image to collect for every ending ♡ Determine your conclusion by making a variety of choices There will be an optional DLC released in the future to make even more stories and 'romantic' partners available. JB has been attending the fancy boarding school Saint Sara Belle for almost a year now. Along with six other students, she’s forced to join an after-school group created for those that are deemed ‘unfriendable’. JB is fine with that, especially because one of the awful people there is her special someone. Well maybe. As much as JB is fixated on her chosen suitor at the start of the tale, the guy may not be worth the great deal of trouble it'll take to actually be with him. The amount of ridiculous, winding ways the story can unfold is frightening. All you can count on for sure is that it will be crazy.
