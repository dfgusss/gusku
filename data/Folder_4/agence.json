    "About the game": "Agence places the fate of artificially intelligent creatures in your hands. Will you help to maintain their peaceful existence, or throw them into a state of chaos? A dynamic film that combines cinematic storytelling, artificial intelligence, and your interactions, Agence is never the same twice. So, will you interfere with intelligent life? As intelligent creatures, the Agents will respond in unexpected ways. They could maintain their harmonious existence, or they could become aggressive with one another. Some could even fall off of their planet into the infinite abyss below. You’ll also notice the Agents express fear, curiosity, boredom, or excitement using vocalizations and facial reactions. In the Agents’ universe, you can: Watch emergent narratives unfold as you wield your power from planet to planet; Plant magical flowers that can impact the Agents’ behaviour and change the way they interact with each other; Move the Agents around to interfere in their existence. You can separate them from each other to avoid conflict, help them achieve balance, save them from falling off the planet, or fling them into the abyss; Rotate the universe to observe the Agents, and see how the narrative plays out from different vantage points; Add Agents into the experience that have been pre-trained by human engineers; using reinforcement learning—a system of goals and rewards that allow the Agents to think and act on their own.",
