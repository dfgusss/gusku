    "About the game": "Introducing the game Experience a majestic tide of fish. Amigo Fishing is a VR game about hunting for fish in the deep sea. The game is set in a mysterious deep-sea region bursting with coral and aquatic life. In the game, you can choose different equipment and weapons and use different kinds of ammunition. While fishing you can charge up your energy gun, and when the king of the ocean is stirred, a huge wave of fish will surge out, after which you can use your assassin’s sword to collect a whole boatful of fish. When you hear the loud call of the giant whale, prepare to face your destiny… How to play Every fisherman is equipped with two special weapons. The weapons will upgrade as they are used and unlock other accessory slots. Via upgrading weapons, completing missions and catching certain kinds of fish, the player can gain access to special accessories. By combining various different accessories you can create your own fishing strategies suited to your own playstyle, to increase your skill at fishing in general or to target certain kinds of fish in particular. The game features over twenty different kinds of fish. Each fish is unique in terms of appearance, speed, difficulty to catch and other special characteristics. Some can be caught head on, while others form groups which you can capture all at once if you cast your net from the side. More exciting fishing tactics await you when you visit this mysterious and bountiful deep-sea region.",
