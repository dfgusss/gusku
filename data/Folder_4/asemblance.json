    "About the game": "Asemblance is a single-player, first-person, psychological thriller. You wake to find yourself trapped inside an experimental machine... A machine built to simulate memories. You no longer recall why you entered, but an AI voice guides you. Trying to escape, you face memories from a past you may not want to remember. But what is real? Are these memories your own? Can you even trust your own mind anymore? Are you even in control? Asemblance is the pilot episode of a mind-bending franchise inspired by The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, and the Black Mirror television series. Soundtrack by Seattle electronic artists Kid Smpl and Johnny Goss.",
