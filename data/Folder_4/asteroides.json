    "About the game": "it's simple, fast, rock-ing, rolling, without pauses, without life, without time will you save the earth? Asteroides is a 70/80s single player shooter with realistic physics and a completely three-dimensional environment. Moving, destroying and surviving is complicated in an infinitely finite space. The game is a classic old school coin up and like all 'jamma' it does not allow pauses in the game, if you stop for a moment... GAME OVER! A game with a very simple concept, it shoots and moves forward and turns clockwise and counterclockwise, 4 buttons... But being able to get out of it alive to the end is truly impossible. Old school rock sounds and music will help you on this journey away from earth.",
