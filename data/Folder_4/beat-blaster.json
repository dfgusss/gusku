    "About the game": "Beat Blaster is a VR game about Shooting &amp; running where everything happens to the beat of the music. An original mix of styles with each level offering a new challenge. 30 SONGS &amp; AMBISONIC AUDIO Each level introduces a novelty and all the games are different thanks to the intelligent generation of levels. Ambisonic sound lets you experience the music in an entirely new way. NO WAITING TIMES There are no loading screens, complicated menus or eternal waiting. Beat Blaster is direct fun without complications. 4 WAYS OF MOVEMENT You can choose between the classic VR controller, the new 3dRudder, tilting the head or the intuitive and original control based on the movement of the head. NO MOTION SICKNESS Beat Blaster is a VR game with a high-speed component. But all moves in the game are designed without rotating the player, thus minimizing the probability of motion sickness. EASY RULES To clear a level, you must reach the end of the song without dying. Sounds easy, doesn't it? You have a Blaster with infinite ammunition and a single life to dodge or kill all the enemies that will appear to the rhythm of the music.",
