If you're unsure about your gamepad's compatibility, test it out with the free demo. ** Play All 6 Game Modes ** BlastZone 1 - Recreation of the original TI-85 game; a simple “defend the base” style game Mission Mode - A 35 minute long, 8 mission cinematic experience with hundreds of unique hand animated enemies and big bosses. Includes unique 3D gameplay mechanics and a 2nd person shooter area! Classic A Mode - A greatly enhanced version of BlastZone 1; a “defend the base” style game with beam weapons and a points chain system. Destroy all enemies before they pass your ship or it is game over. Classic B Mode - Similar to Classic A, but with a points pool system; every action either adds to or subtracts from the points value and the player needs to stop the game at the right point to get a high score. The game keeps getting tougher; get too cocky and you could lose it all! Survival Mode - Similar control scheme to Mission Mode, but with infinitely generated levels and a unique multiplier scoring system that depends on skill shots to get the best score. Blitz Mode - Similar to Survival Mode, but massively increases the number of enemies on screen and gives you a fully powered ship from the start to combat them. The key to this mode is to maintain hyper power to keep those weapons powered; running out of energy can mean certain death from the large swarms of enemies! Additional Features include: 2D controls, but with hazards and gameplay elements moving around in full 3D space Cooperative multiplayer both local and online for 2 players Unlock the full power of your ship with hyper mode and unleash the devastating power of the omega cannon!
