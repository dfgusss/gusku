    "About the game": "Your childhood revisited. Play with up to 8 people in this fast-paced, movement-centered action game. When cursed, you are assigned the role of passing the curse onto another player. Use the speed and energy bonuses given to you as a cursed player to your advantage to rid yourself of impending doom. When not cursed, you have to run away from the player carrying the curse. Strategize and position yourself appropriately with the various objects placed at your disposal. Use the bouncy walls to redirect momentum, as the cursed player is capable of outrunning you. As the timer ticks down, death only lurks closer and closer. Upon death, the cursed player is blown up into a million pieces. After this, the player closest to the dying player will be the next one cursed. Should you be the last one standing, you win the game. Dynamically crafted soundtrack with music changing as the game progresses. Numerous customization options to make the game appeal to your liking. Lobby settings to include a twist on the default gameplay. Different maps to choose from, all with their own unique style. Proximity voice chat so you can speak as your friends pass you by. Easy to learn, hard to master. The grappling hook alone can provide you with hours of fun, and you can learn by swinging while waiting for a new round to begin.",
