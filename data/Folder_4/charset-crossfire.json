    "About the game": "A retro maze shooting game with a weird and wacky menagerie of enemies. Survive and collect powerups to progress through 10+ levels. 16+ enemy types also want those pickups but if you don't beat them to it you can blast it out of them. These critters will cause increasing chaos as they fill up the mazes with their unique behaviors, abilities, alliances, and rivalries. Inspired by a Commodore 64 game called 'Crossroads 2 : Pandemonium' which squeezed more enemies on screen by replacing some of the character set with tiny sprites : battle an alphabet of wizards, animals, aliens, androids, warriors and... other things?! Make your own or share mazes in .txt files. Four player local multiplayer open coop/competitive/pvp.",
