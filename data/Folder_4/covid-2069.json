    "About the game": "In a future much like our own a new strain of virus devastates the globe. More contagious than anything before. You find yourself trapped amid a pandemic, with enemies everywhere how will you make it out? Shoot, sneak or run through waves of zombies in this post apocalyptic cyberpunk zombie adventure. Armed with only a pistol and your good senses. You need to get out of a densely populated city before you're next. Enemies are plenty, and everywhere so keep moving. Zombies will walk, then Sprint at you. Robot security drones will kill anything alive. Weapons and ammo are scarce so save what you have and if you find a more powerful weapon use it until you can't. It won't be there long. You won't save the world this time but can you save yourself?",
