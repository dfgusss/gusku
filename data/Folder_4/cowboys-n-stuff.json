    "About the game": "Cowboys n' Stuff is a 2D, Top-down, wave-survival orientated game where you control and customise your cowboy in order to eliminate threats as they arrive; whether it is day or night... In Cowboys n' Stuff you are able to equip your cowboy with various items such as cosmetics and weapons in order to not only look the part, but also develop a weapon load out which suits your play style (Guns blazing, Close-Range Combat, and more!). Items can be acquired through the in-game shop and also by completing campaigns. If your looking for a greater challenge though, be sure to check out endless mode. This mode will for sure challenge your strategy as the waves get progressively harder by both, enemy quantity and enemy variety. So i wish you the best!
