    "About the game": "Ever wanted to try flying a racing drone? The CurryKitten FPV Simulator lets you try. Take charge of a powerful and acrobatic quadcopter and learn to fly it around the mountainous landscape. Rip through the partly-constructed building, bash into the beach ball, chase cars or fly up close and personal with an AI plane. Play alone or online with friends. This sim is friendly enough to learn on with a basic game controller but will excel when combined with a hobby-grade RC radio. This simulator is being constantly being developed and new features are arriving regularly. The community all get a chance to have their say into what is developed next, but current improvements/features include - - Interactive flight training - Quad ball, the online football-like game.... but with quads - More interactive buildings, like cranes and bridges - increases customization in camera FOV",
