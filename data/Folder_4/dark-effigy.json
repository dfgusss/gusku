The player will need to explore and find these pieces while avoiding the monsters inhabiting the valley. Gameplay Features Explore a monster infested valley The game takes place in an abandoned valley overrun with monsters. You will need to explore and search every nook and crany this valley and find the pieces of an ancient and powerful effigy capable of banishing the monsters from the valley. Listen carefully The monsters roaming the world may sneak up on you at any moment. Your first warning will be the sound of their footsteps. Your second warning will be the sound of their snarls. Your third warning will be their screech as they charge you, but by then it is already to late... Lore Long ago the Valley of Og was infested with terrible monsters. The people there lived in constant fear that every day was going to be their last. In their desperation they turned to an old and terrible god for protection. The god offered to rid the valley of monsters if the people of Og agreed to worship it. A pact was struck and the old god sealed the monsters of the valley in an effigy. The people of Og rejoiced and for a time everything was well. But as the centuries passed the people of Og started forgetting about the god who gave them protection, and the pact that was struck. They started neglecting the devotion they where expected to show their protector and the old god was displeased by this. The final straw came when foreign preachers entered the valley and convinced the people of Og to turn away from worshiping their savior. In its anger the old god shattered the effigy and released the monsters back into the valley. The people of Og where forced to flee lest they be destroyed. In their desperation they once again turned to the old god for protection. The god agreed to restore the effigy and seal away the monsters once more if the people of Og agreed to never again cease their worship of it. The god also required a test of faith. Someone needed to go into the valley and bring all the pieces of the effigy back together. Many have tried, but so far none have succeeded in restoring the effigy, and now it is your turn to try and bring peace to the Valley of Og.",
