    "About the game": "Defenders of the West is a classic tower defense game set in the wild west . It adds some unique twists to the classic genre and will appeal to players of all skill levels. A large gang of bandits has organized into a small army. The old Marshall Robert B. Gun has enlisted you and some of his old friends to stop them. The unique setting, beautiful, hand crafted environments, dynamic levels and a cool story with a pinch of humor set this game apart from other tower defense games. A wide variety of enemies, towers with at least 3 upgrades each, perks and abilities combined with three levels of difficulty offer high replayability. Set up your towers and watch the carnage unfold with a rotatable and zoom- able camera! Show those bandits what it means to be a Defender of the West!",
