    "About the game": "16-bit a gogo! Harken back to the days of old-school fun with a modern twist! Lured by a vengeful spirit of a defeated witch, Duckles, and his friends, find themselves trapped on a mysterious island full of deadly sorceresses! What heinous plans does this gruesome Witch have for him? This is NO place for a colourful 16-bit duck-hero to be but he's all the more determined to prove otherwise when he learns of the oppressed island's true origins. Discovering new allies and formidable foes along the way, Duckles must save the Winged Folk, restore peace to the island and vanquish the evils that pulsate in the blackest of hearts, of the Jigsaw Witch! WHO'S THIS GAME FOR? FOR THOSE WHO TAKE LIFE A LITTLE LESS SERIOUS, THAT'S WHO! Duckles is a 16-bit hero that changes the game theme every adventure he sets out to. This time: a somewhat, dark witch-themed, 32-bit metroidvainia-esque experience. If you love wacky, silly and crude humour like the good ol' 90's cartoons... but also love a carefully crafted plot that puts all the craze-filled broken pieces of the mirror back together again, then this game is for you! If you like to take your time, explore, discover on your own, enjoy stories and experience unique games, then this game is definitely for you! THE JIGSAW WITCH TRAP! Witch Mersha has trapped our little hero and his friends in a twisted witch-maze of Witch Island! Can you help him find his way out, rescues his friends and find the true meaning of the enchanted island!? 16 BIT- METROIDVANIA STYLE &amp; TRADITIONAL PLATFORMING BLEND! With a blend of classic 16-bit platforming and the Metroidvania genre, platform and fight your way across diverse landscapes, from a lava-filled hotel, spiders' nest to gothic frog castles and Atlantis city filled with soda pop! Collect secrets, brew ingredients, find bonuses, witch-essence and more, as you climb, jump, bounce, slash, combo and ride your way to victory! CO-OP PLAY! Toggle between cooperative and single player anytime during your playthrough locally to help defeat the witches. Dialogue changes depending on 1 or 2 players! IN-HOUSE MUSIC BAND Over 32 catchy and atmospheric songs composed from the hearts of avid gamers - a nod to those who love game music! From Italian-inspired to atmospheric and goth-rock tracks! LARGER THAN LIFE CHARACTERS, ENEMIES, AND BOSSES! Over 10 crazy and insane challenging bosses with unique quirks, themes, and epicness! Loads of characters and NPCs - all with unique background stories and personalities! Nothing stays the same! PLACED TIME EVENTS! Battle it out with your duck hero sword and eggplant cannon, with the all-new unique 'Placed Time Event' system that allows players to perform cool feats with just one simple touch of the button, whilst keeping the challenge engaging during combat! A STORY WITH FUN, BONKERS DEPTH Don't judge a duck by his feathers! Get the true ending to conclude an in-depth but funny story, featuring a crazy cast of friends and foes! OVER 8 HOURS OF GAMEPLAY We wanted a full game so we created it! Over 4 years of development - we're hoping to take you on a crazy but fun ride!",
