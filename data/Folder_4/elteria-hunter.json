That's why the humans created a guild full of hunters to take down these monsters and keep peace in the world. But humans are not alone in this world. There are gods and demons too. In every region there is an Elder monster who controls the region and protects it from danger. But something strange is coming and even the Elders are acting up more dangerous than normal. So are you the new hunter that can protect us for what’s coming next? The primary focus in-game is following the story towards the stronger monsters.
