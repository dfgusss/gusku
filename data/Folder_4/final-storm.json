    "About the game": "Well, you've done it now. You landed your sorry little ship in a small hostile arena with no hope of escape. The best you can do is exercise your unquestionably awesome trigger finger to earn yourself a few more minutes ... nay ... seconds of precious life! Final Storm is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter and bullet hellish game. It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just wanna shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way (.. ahem... you'll need them). Enemies increase in number and difficulty as waves progress. They're worth more points each wave. When you've slain enough enemies without meeting your end, power-ups will be dropped in the center of the area. But hurry - they disappear after 10 seconds if you don't pick them up. Let's be honest, you're not looking at this game for depth of story or the latest cutting edge VR experience. You're looking at this because you want to shoot stuff! You want to shoot lots of stuff! Now go forth, have fun, and die with honor. Features Endless Waves of Enemies Boss / Challenge Waves 15 Achievements 5 Power-ups An Awesome Soundtrack Thumbs aching with Joy Power Ups If you shoot enough enemies and live long enough, you'll pick up power-ups to help you in your battle. If you're lucky enough to get more than one power-up, you'll be allowed to select one to keep after you die for being such an excellent contender! Energy Shield This passive power-up surrounds your ship with a force field that can withstand up to 3 impacts. Tri Shot This passive power-up is a weapon upgrade. Because 3 bullets are better than one. Fires 3 bullets from your main cannon giving you a 30 degree field of fire! Side Shot This passive power-up is a weapon upgrade. Fires a bullet to the left and right of your ship's direction . Of course you can still pivot your main cannon. Helps to protect your flanks! Freeze Wave (Special Weapon) This is an active power-up. When you pick up this item an icon of an icy snowflake will appear next to your life meter. Launch this weapon with your Right bumpers or triggers. Ice your enemies and stop them in their tracks for 6 seconds of glorious relief! And Laze-Blade (Special Weapon) This is an active power-up. When you pick up this item an icon of a sweeping laser will appear to the right of your score. Launch this item with your Left bumpers or triggers. Slam a spinning blade of flaming death into your enemies for about 6 seconds and take satisfaction in their cries of agony! A Short Life Lasts Longer with a Gamepad While this game CAN be played with keyboard and mouse it's really hard that way. It is best played with a Gamepad or XBox controller. Any gamepad supporting X-Input should work. This game has been tested with XBox 360 Controllers, MadCat generic Xbox controllers, Logitech 310 and 8bitdo NES30. Gamepad Controls Any gamepad supporting X-Input with dual sticks configured for your operating system should work.
