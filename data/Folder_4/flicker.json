    "About the game": "Flicker is a rhythmical Jump-and-avoid game. eat yellow squares(like pack-man!), and avoid other squares. If you eat enough yellow-things, then you will be in the state of annoying flickering. That (flickering) means you are invincible. So you might desire to eat the yellows. That's the key point of the game. It's so easy to play, and easy to kill your time. So be careful to play the game. There are funny 3 stages available.",
