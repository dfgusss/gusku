Of its once young and daring pilots, those who survived count their remaining years to retirement on a small government pension. Its spaceships, decades ago considered the pinnacle of spaceship design and technology, are almost space junk to modern eyes - barely kept in service through repeated retrofitting and cheap part replacements. Welcome to The Galactic Asteroids Patrol! Personal Note: 7 years ago we finished working on this lovely game but we never got to publish it properly. Back in the day we tried to publish on Steam Greenlight but by the time we got approved we had already moved on, we were tired and sadly gave up on the game. Recently my dream of creating games has reawakened and I found our game lying around in one of my folders. At that moment I got really excited, opened the old Unity project and started poking around. I was reminded how fun it is to play and decided to re-launch it. The game was made using Unity 3.5 and updating it to the the new Unity version is out of my scope right now. I will do my best to provide updates &amp; support for this game. If you enjoy the game and would like to support my future endeavors as an indie dev please consider buying a copy so I can invest in a future game. You are welcome to follow my development log.",
