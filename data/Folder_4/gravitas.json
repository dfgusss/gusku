    "About the game": "Gravitas is a short first-person puzzle platforming game that transports you to the Gallery of Refined Gravity (otherwise known as the GORG). There you’ll meet the gallery’s eccentric Curator as he accompanies you through its puzzling and increasingly lethal exhibits. Manipulate gravity and the gallery itself to prove yourself a pupil worthy of the Curator’s masterwork. Bend gravity to navigate the Curator's curious exhibitions. Explore the gallery with the *genius* Curator as your guide. Manipulate the gallery's cubes with your gravity powers and defy death. Galaxy Shark Studios is comprised of a team of 14 game developers. We started Gravitas in college three years ago, inspired by some of the games we loved, and we are happy to finally put it out there for others to enjoy. If you want to know more about us and the game, check out our official website. And if you have any feedback or questions about Gravitas, don't hesitate to contact us and let us know!",
