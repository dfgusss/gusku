    "About the game": "I deserve a happy ending is a BL visual novel inspired by both fairytales and metafiction about a prince who lives inside an unfinished book. Rather than offer commentary on either fantasy or visual novels, I deserve a happy ending celebrates engaging with and enjoying fantastical stories. Once upon a time there was a prince who had to carry out an heroic deed in order to claim his rightful place as king, but who never got to do so, because the writer of the book he inhabits disappeared before finishing the story. Now, with the help of the latest person to pick up the book, he's decided to get his happy ending once and for all — and if that happens to include one of the two handsome strangers that are the other main characters of the story, even better. Will the prince manage to become the ruler he's meant to be and find love in the process? Namemeable protagonist More than 50,000 words in length 3 routes. Choose between a soft-spoken elf from a foreign land, a dark wizard from another time, or delve deeper into the mystery of the book! 6 different endings Available in English and Spanish",
