    "About the game": "Impossiball – Gamers Challenge is a 3D plattformer where you simply roll around a ball. You may think – bruh – how boring! But that’s totally wrong! It’s rather frustrating. Why? Because mastering the game is truly challenging: Controlling the ball is hard. There are no explanations. You die all the time. The game just hates the player! Few players make it through all levels, almost none through the hardmode. Some love it, many despise it. But one thing is truly satisfying – beating that one level that just drove you nuts! Elevators, keys, activators, traps, physics and gravity bring complexity to the game. The tiny world of Impossiball is home to easter eggs as well as hidden levels and achievements. Measure your skills and check which level will bring you to the end of yourself. Imposiball is unmerciful to its players. Even though some players play it to relax, many will find themselves playing the game nervously and tensioned. Play the game together with your friends in front of one PC - it's way more satisfying than failing and succeeding alone! Experience the joy when you finally beat a hard level. Experience the frustration of losing. Experience your ambitiousness to beat the game! Experience 4-∞ hours of gameplay! Play Impossiball - Gamers Challenge and beat the game or poorly fail!",
