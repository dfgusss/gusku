    "About the game": "Insipid is a puzzle game for vigilance. The game has a simple interface, where the player is presented with a field of cells of identical, at first glance, cells. The player must find and click on a cell that has a less saturated color than the rest. The higher the Player's score, the more implicit the difference between the cells becomes. The game has two modes: Normal and Time-Rush. In Normal mode, the player can look around the field and find the cells for as long as he likes, this mode is suitable for training vision. Time-Rush mode has a timer that is updated each time the player finds the correct cage. New records are recorded only in Time-Rush mode!",
