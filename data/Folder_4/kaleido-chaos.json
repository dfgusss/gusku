    "About the game": "Have you played a game about 'move the red block avoiding crashing with the blue ones', which flourished in the years around 2010? It was said that the game was one of the training programs for the pilots from some countries air forces. Kaleido Chaos is a little similar to that game but more flexible and playable.It is a game of reaction and attention, it can help people improve their concentration, reflexes and reaction time. In the game, player controls the Kaleido Cube to hit the right balls to get score and dodge the wrong balls to prevent losing score. To get high score, you need to be patient, calm, undistracted and with short reaction time --it is really a tough training rather than an easy game! If you can reach more than 600 score in 7 Colors Mode of INIFINITE, you must be a genius! (Click the INFINITE button on the main UI and then select '7 Colors Mode', you can play that '7 Colors Mode of INIFINITE' tough game mode.) NOTE: You might be a little bit hard to get how to play this game, please download the manual right here to get more details and it is really helpful! Global Ranks and Leaderboard are only available for the GAME MODE of INFINITE and FUNNYLUCK, not for the CHALLENGE! So, if you want to review your records and global ranks, please play the game mode of FUNNYLUCK and INFINITE! 1 Color Mode can help people get the rules of Kaleid Chaos, but it can't shows the real fun of this game. Please have a try of the game modes of multiple-Colors(Such as 3 Colors Mode , 5 Colors Mode and 7 Colors Mode) under FUNNYLUCK and INFINITE, it will show you the real fun of Kaleido Chaos!
