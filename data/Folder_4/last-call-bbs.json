The Barkeep’s loaded up his retro computer with a full set of puzzle games for you to download and play. No need to worry about copy protection, they’re all fully cracked and ready to enjoy! Includes eight full games: 20th Century Food Court : Design factories to produce food just like they did over 700 years ago in the 20th century. Keep your costs low and your machines running fast! STEED FORCE Hobby Studio : Assemble robot models based on the anime smash hit Steed Force right on your computer. No sandpaper required! X’BPGH: The Forbidden Path : Enter a cursed world and create bizarre flesh sculptures in exchange for eternal life. The master is pleased… but can you trust him? Sawayama Solitaire : It wouldn’t be a Zachtronics release without a brand-new solitaire game. This time it’s a fresh take on Klondike, the “classic” solitaire variant. Dungeons &amp; Diagrams : Try your hand at these beguiling tile-based logic puzzles. Can you map out the dungeons and steal all the treasure? ChipWizard™ Professional : Build integrated circuits using wires, transistors, and capacitors. Wait a second, is this a game or a CAD program? HACK*MATCH : The tile-matching minigame from EXAPUNKS, completely remastered with a single player campaign and local head-to-head multiplayer (with Steam Remote Play support). Kabufuda Solitaire : Create matching sets of Japanese kabufuda cards in this retro-demake of the challenging original solitaire game that debuted in Eliza. Plus: Travel back to a time when personal computers were new and exciting, with high-resolution pixel art and an FM-infused soundtrack! Learn the story behind Last Call's mysterious sysop, The Barkeep, as well as the developers of the games and legendary 90s PC manufacturer, Sawayama Corporation.",
