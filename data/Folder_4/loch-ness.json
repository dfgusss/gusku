    "About the game": "Loch Ness is a 1-4 Player Co-Op Horror Hunter where you play as disgraced researchers hoping to prove once and for all what you have always known; the Loch Ness Monster exists. You and your team must navigate the precarious waters, hunt for Nessie’s feeding ground and lay bait to lure her out. But be careful, for lurking deep beneath the lake is a creature more ancient than all mankind… Gather a team of friends, strangers or play solo and set upon the lake in your ramshackle rowboats. Use real life Nessie hunting equipment like the DNA Scanner, Sonar and Underwater Camera to gather the evidence you need to conclusively prove the Loch Ness Monster exists. Will you play it safe, collect your samples and flee before you anger the ancient horror, or will you stick it out, bravely bait the monster out, and gather the most concrete evidence with only a flare gun for protection? Character Customization - Create your own Nessie hunter, customizing their appearance to express your creativity or show off your achievements with unlockable cosmetics Water-based Horror - Whether fighting against the waves to keep afloat, or probing the murky depths of Nessie's realm, you must contend with the most powerful force of nature to survive Replayability - Randomized Nessie locations and an AI Director working behind the scenes ensure every game is a unique experience Scoring System - Acquiring more conclusive proof and with quicker times will net you a better score, unlocking unique cosmetics and eventually new difficulty modes and monster types Immersive, realistic graphics - Hand crafted 3D assets alongside the latest Unreal Engine 4 technology truly immerse you in the harrowing atmosphere of the Loch",
