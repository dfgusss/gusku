    "About the game": "MahJong generates random tile arrangements that gives you infinite game possibilities for this Chinese-inspired favorite. Featuring 10 different tile and table sets, each tile is a delightful, hand-designed work of art, showcased in a 3D view with board rotation and zoom to capture every angle. Select and match pairs of open tiles to remove them from the board, exposing layers of tiles below for more matching. The goal is to match every pair to fully clear the board. Outstanding music completes the experience that will transport you eastward.",
