    "About the game": "I developed Mainly at Rest to prove to people that it can be an eternal challenge rather than finishing Getting over it or ALTF4. I wish you good luck in advance. - Mainly at rest is a climbing game similar to Getting over it but this time you will need your legs and endurance. - Climb a huge snow mountain full of pitfalls and traps to overcome all obstacles and end the suffering. - But the game isn't as hard as it seems to follow your path and you'll make it - With the help of your leg, you'll soon be able to run, jump and fly. - The average time to play a tester is 2 hours. I thank them in advance for their help in developing the game. (I didn't finish the game) Show me what you can do and conquer my challenge! (Good luck)",
