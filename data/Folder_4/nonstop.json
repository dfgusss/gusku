    "About the game": "Try to SURVIVE on another planet Carol! I'm a big fan of 11bit.! This is a 'This War of Mine' like game with 2D pixel art style. You need to manage your resources and find a way to survive on Planet Carol. You are an astronaut, crashed on Planet Carol. All you have are one pitiful kitten and Robot Hal. Can you survive here with your wisdom and courage? Can you fix your spaceship and go find your teammates? Will you promise you will always protect little Kitty? And, find out the truth behind this mission! Most image resources come from me, an programmer. So, you know, not good-looking... but I do put my heart in it. :) This is my first game. Hope someone may like it. :) Finally, I believe Science fiction is the ultimate romance for mankind! 中文在开始菜单的options选项里哦，祝大家新年快乐~",
