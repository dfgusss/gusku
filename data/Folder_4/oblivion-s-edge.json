    "About the game": "One pilot One ship 10 billion lives to save You are the last pilot on Earth, tasked with slowing down the invasion and giving survivors enough time to escape. If you can hold back the waves long enough, you may have a shot at destroying the massive mothership and saving the Earth. Oblivion’s Edge is an arcade and bullet hell inspired twin stick shooter with multiple game modes and difficulty levels. Bullet Hell inspired Twin Stick Shooter Multiple game modes Multiple weapon boosters Deployable defensive items Challenging boss fights Three difficulty settings for each game mode Keyboard/mouse and Xbox One / Xbox 360 controller support PC, Mac, Linux Our solar system has been invaded by a mysterious and powerful alien army. Any attempt at fighting back has failed.  We lost contact with the fleet, they are assumed to be destroyed. Now the battle has come to Earth. Our resources have dwindled; our defenses are destroyed. Staging an assault is impossible. Our only chance for survival is you, Earth’s last pilot. Survival:   You are the last pilot in the last ship standing between Earth and invading alien army. Your job is to destroy the approaching waves of enemies so escape pods can leave Earth’s orbit. You will have to withstand not only the enemy drones, fighters and blockade runners but also offensive satellites and the massive almost indestructible mothership. Defend: The last orbiting defensive satellite has been damaged. Earth has sent a bot to fix it, but it’s up to you to keep the enemy away until its repaired. This time you’re not alone, you’ve got gun turrets to help keep the satellite safe. If the satellite is lost, it’s game over, for you and for Earth. Minefield: The enemy has found a way to disable your primary weapons leaving you with only bombs, mines and flares to destroy the enemy. How long can you last? Classic: Defend against waves of increasingly fast enemies heading straight towards the Earth. If too many get past then it's game over.",
