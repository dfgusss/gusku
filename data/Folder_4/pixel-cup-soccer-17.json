    "About the game": "Pixel Cup Soccer 17 is an arcade retro style soccer game. A dynamic arcade game with a fast paced gameplay. Just the fun part of soccer! Pixel Cup Soccer 17 features great pixel art and soundtracks that evoke nostalgia of the glory days of the 80’s and 90’s arcade games. Move, pass, and shoot the ball to victory! You will learn to play in one minute, but it takes much longer to master it. The simple controls enable a rich set of features such as charging and aiming your shots, directing your corner kicks and throw-ins, shooting lobs, dashing, and more. Play single player (player VS computer), two players (player VS player), or Party Mode (in Competitions). Pixel Cup Soccer currently supports local multiplayer only. With your support, we would like to add new features, a career mode, and eventually, why not, online multiplayer! Play Modes 1. Friendly Match 2. Competitions 3. Penalty Kicks Competitions Copa America Centenario (USA) European Cup 2016 (France) World Cup Women's World Cup Pixel Cups (men and women) Pixel League Pixel Tournament",
