    "About the game": "About the game qb is an open world sandbox adventure game (ALPHA STATE) , where you can create and explore nearly infinite worlds. Solve challenging quests together with your friends and earn unique rewards. Collect precious raw goods and craft useful items. Enchant your gear to make it even stronger. Enhance your character and learn specialized abilities. Help the villagers and grow their homeland. Find hidden treasures and reveal their secrets. About us We are a team of three developers and work on qb in our freetime. It was only a small project at first which was meant for trying out new things. But once more and more features were added we decided to share qb with other players. In the current state of the game not all features are implemented and before we add more features it is better to get feedback from other players first. We would like to point out that current features and functions still contain bugs which can crash the game. With the start of the Early Access phase we might be able to employ more people to help and support us working on the game.
