    "About the game": "'There are lots of predators out there... stalkers who'd just love to have a taste of someone like you...' The graveyard shift at a dingy diner in San Francisco -- that's where MC's story begins. It's just another normal night, or at least it seems to be. ...That is, until a certain mysterious customer stops by, bringing the dangerous attention of a few people with him. When it rains, it pours, and suddenly MC finds himself in the middle of a war he didn't even know existed... between vampires. How does MC react to the dark, violent world that opens up before him? That's up to you! ► Genre: Drama, BxB romance, dark modern ► Length: ~60,000 words ► Endings: 8 (4 good, 4 bad) ► Changeable MC personality &amp; interests ► Different dialogue &amp; choices based on personality ► 11 track OST with a dark, urban vibe ► 14 CGs Argent Games is a 2-person team comprised of Dovah (writer/programmer/designer) and Gamma (producer/manager). After bonding together over a shared love of things such as games, anime, and Yaoi, we formed Argent Games in 2016. We have two other BL games available on Steam -- Requiescence and Chess of Blades! Red Embrace is the third Boy's Love (or yaoi) mystery/romance visual novel game developed by Argent Games, and many more are planned in the future!",
