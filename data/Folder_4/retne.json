    "About the game": "In RETNE you are a tourist travelling through VR Land. There's lots to see and so many things to do, but there’s a catch; it’s A DIY tour, so you have to do the hard work to visit all the magical attractions that the VR world has to offer. But don’t worry, you’ll be accompanied by your very own quirky tour guide ‘Lil Mo’ who will give you a helping hand. Together you will have an adventure that shows the wonders of VR Land and by the end of the tour you’ll only want to see more. Get ready to play and be surprised by the only tour in VR Land. RETNE has been made by a team from Northern Ireland - VRNI Ltd, Kainos, Enter Yes, David Baxter Audio, actor Michael Smiley (Rogue One, Dr Evazan) and supported by NI Screen, Invest NI and Digital Catapult.",
