On a cool summer day, everything was doing just fine, when all of a sudden... BOOM! It wasn't! King Bearton awakens and steals the princess of Castle Kingdom! With the kingdom fallen, and quite frankly they were low on options, the Rhythm Knights, now one, will go on an epic quest to save the princess, defeat King Bearton, and avenge the village! There will be enemies along the way, so you will need to prepare to defeat them with the power of ... music?! Features: A unique battle/rhythm system that is filled to the brim with completely original and cute characters. A major boss fight with a unique mechanic.
