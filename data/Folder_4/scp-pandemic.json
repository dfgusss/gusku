    "About the game": "ONGOING GOALS FOR DEVELOPMENT To create one of the most immersive and extensive tactical experiences. To solidify this game into the SCP universe, and bring in a whole facet of worldbuilding and lore into every possible aspect of the experience — all in an effort to make this a true SCP game. Heavily extend on replayability, especially multiplayer-focused gamemodes. Things have and will continue to take some time, but we are dedicated to this project and want to make this the best it can be. We've been doing this for a few years now, and we are happy to continue through many more to carry this to completion. Please take a look at our roadmap if you haven't already to see what we're working on &amp; will work on over time. Thank you to everyone who supported us through the stages of development thus far, we couldn't have done this without you. ALTERED DIRECTIVE The directive of the SCP Foundation was previously the study and containment of anomalous objects. Upon the discovery of a malicious entity embedded within the collective human subconscious, the directive changed to the extermination of the entire human race using all resources they have at their disposal to carry it out — also known as The Omnicide. RAID ON AREA 12 You are the Anti-Foundation Alliance (AFA), tasked with the active prevention and counter-measures to The Omnicide. Your squad is tasked with the raid and destruction of Area 12, where a biological program has been developed; the Psi-Z Program. This program was developed with the purpose of assaulting civilian population centers in the Midwestern United States. HUNT You play as the AFA and their siege against various locations to destroy their infrastructure, resources, and further your prevention against The Omnicide while they attempt to gun you down. The first map is based in southern Sweden, where The Foundation is posted for deployment into northern Europe. Also present in this compound is a satellite ground station, where they are broadcasting a cognitohazard into military and civilian communication equipment in the region. KEY GAME FEATURES Semi-linear story, you are a fireteam going against the SCP Foundation during a containment breach. Experience 1-2 hours of story content in the base game. Discover and immerse yourself in the rich story and lore, deeply inspired by the SCP-5000 canon by Tanhony. Will be expanded on and integrated through ongoing development. Peek corners, breach doors, and engage in immersive tactical combat. Detailed and fairly extensive weapon customization. Detailed audio design with occlusion-based wall muffling.
