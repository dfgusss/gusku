    "About the game": "Good news! You bounced off the police station at just the right angle, collided as planned with the giant, green bowling ball, and crashed into the blue truck. The driver never saw it coming and you definitely broke your old high score. Now do it again! What would you do if you didn't have to worry about getting a headache from running into a wall? If you could launch yourself out of a giant cannon? If your world had roof tops filled with beach balls? Well, if you ever asked yourself those questions, do we have the game for you! Game Play Short fuse is a 3D physics game where you become the ammo! Aim, launch yourself, navigate in the air, then crash into whatever seems the most fun. Watch your score grow, discover pickups, and explore the various levels, each with a different layout, theme, and difficulty! The Levels Expertly crafted by a veteran team of Peruvian kamikaze pilots and two and a half summer interns, the broad selection of levels offers varying game play and challenge. The Players Why only fire one nitwit out of a cannon if you can select from 30? Exactly! That's what we thought too, so we implemented 15! We're half way there! The High Scores Oh right. We have scores, too. Big ones even - at least if you do your job right.",
