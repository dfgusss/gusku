    "About the game": "Simply Hard Platformer is just that.. a game that's simple to play but very hard to beat. Featuring permadeath, fall off of a platform or touch a Deathcube and it's back to Level 1. Built entirely by one person, SHP features 50 levels, each one getting progressively harder. Invite your friends over and watch them get frustrated as they slip up and have to start from square one. Do you have what it takes to beat Level 50?! Story You are June. A ninja that borrowed far too many coins. The Ninja Loan Agency wants their coins back and are threatening to send more ninjas after you! Unfortunately... You have spent all of your coins on huge candy bars and tiny pies instead of a weapon. Now you have to collect all of the coins you owe!!! Good luck... Disclaimer Dromedary Games is not responsible for broken keyboards, broken minds, or broken friendships. Requirements Simply Hard Platformer should work on any Windows computer whether your PC is powered by the Large Hadron Collider, or a lemon with probes in it",
