    "About the game": "Summary You are Simon Hopper who tries to find his sister Alice, mysteriously disappeared in the great forest of Grayson in October 15, 1976. Near the forest, a government facility called Skyland has been built in the 1950s to prepare for the Cold War. Since the abduction, you suspect members of Skyland to be responsible for Alice’s disappearance but you are lacking of evidence. You made the choice to devote your life to the search of the truth and for over fifteen years, you tried to find your sister. In vain. Until today, October 15th, 1991… Skyland 1976 is a narrative first person survival-horror game. In this title, you will have to retrieve documents and items to solve puzzles and to understand the story. You will have to survive and fight hunger, thirst, your insanity and increasingly more powerful enemies with limited resources. A few words From the Developer My name is Simon CLAVEL, I’m a software engineer and a video game developer during my spare time. I am a survival-horror game lover and I had the opportunity to enjoy a whole range of those incredible games, from the most classic games to the most independent ones. I got the idea to develop my own survival-horror based on my experience. After several months of development, I can present you my first title, Skyland 1976 strongly focused on the story, survival and puzzles solving. This game should keep you in suspense for about eight hours and more for the beginners. Glhf !",
