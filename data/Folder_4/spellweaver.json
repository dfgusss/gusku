    "About the game": "Spellweaver is a fast-paced and strategically deep digital card game, featuring several mechanics unique to the genre. Created by an indie team of seasoned game developers, and designed by a Magic: the Gathering National Champion, it is easy to learn, yet challenging for veteran card game players. One of Spellweaver's core gameplay features is hero development. During a game, your hero levels up, gains resources, and can develop additional hero skills , letting you craft the perfect hero to complement your deck's strategy. Spellweaver's combat system features an innovative creature speed mechanic . Fast creatures allow you to dictate how combat goes, but they have generally weaker stats. Slower creatures are bigger and stronger, but they are also easy to outmaneuver. Spellweaver's design allows for quick games, yet offers a huge number of combinations and paths to victory to explore. Join in and have endless hours of fun with this strategic card game created with a lot of passion!",
