    "About the game": "Splinter Zone is a fast paced, run &amp; gun arcade platformer, where you play through an endless string of short, handcrafted levels. Your task is simple: Survive for as long as you can and shoot everything that moves to get as many points as possible. The game demands and rewards perfection above anything else, but if you’re willing to look, you might also find things you’re not supposed to find. Who knows, maybe you’ll even find a way to escape this system of eternal punishment? A challenging experience You will fall into pits, you will get shot at, and some clown will probably jump on your head over and over again. The game might tell you, that you're not good enough to play it, but it's a lie! Reliable randomness Splinter Zone doesn’t feature a true random level generation. Instead, its levels are hand-crafted, but the order in which they appear is randomly generated. This way it is still possible for you to get familiar with the game’s challenges while still having a unique experience every time you play. A combo system that rewards perfection above all else The more enemies you destroy and the less damage you take, the more devastating your attacks will get. Activate HYPER MODE to not only tremendously increase your damage output for a short time, but also your score. Permission to Cheat Sometimes, life's too short to play a challenging videogame. For those moments, Splinter Zone features a handy array of cheats that you can enable right at the start of the game. You can even turn off all enemies in the game, if you so desire... Secrets There's more to this game that you might initially think...",
