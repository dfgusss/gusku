    "About the game": "Square is life! This is a minimalist logic game about assembling square from pieces scattered around. Start with one or few controllable fragments and lead them to collect missing parts. But be aware, there are many opportunities to lose: get stuck in hallway; add an extra piece not where you want it; accidentally destroy the necessary part of the shape etc. On the other hand, wave-like complexity, melodic soundtrack, exclusively created for this game, a variety of mechanics are softening possible frustrations of fails. All of this makes you learn every step and enjoy every victory. Complete all 70 lovely-crafted levels and become master of square assembling!",
