    "About the game": "Egad! There is trouble atentacle on the planet Squidtopia. The vile technoanarchist, Associate Professor Spyloctopus, is up to his old tricks and has abducted this year's royal brood. Will you heed the call and come to Emperor Billy's aid? (spoiler alert: YES!) Come join the gang from EverythingHerbs on their first off-planet adventure! Will you choose to help Aenea fight against the evil Associate Professor Spyloctopus? Or help Nick in his eternal struggle against the forces of good? The choice is yours, or is it? From the guy who used to work for the guys who brought you such legendary gaming franchises as: COMMAND AND CONQUER, DUNE, LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, SIM CITY and FARMVILLE comes a brand new gaming universe loaded with puzzles, action, and a whole fish full of fun. FEATURES: * Classical SUDOKU puzzle mechanics using various fish types instead of numbers. * Two different story campaigns. Will you help Aenea rescue the poor little squidlings or...not? * Life and death choices as you race to free the cute little squidlings! * Exotic weaponry and a complete disregard for the prime directive! * Random game generator offers virtually unlimited hours of gameplay. Notes: * If you love sudoku and have a sense of humor this is the game for you. However, please keep in mind this game was made for the TEEN+ crowd and it's not really suited for young kids. * The game plays in a 1024x768 window, however you can toggle to full-screen by tapping the space bar. * Otherwise all controls are point-and-click (and drag-and-drop).",
