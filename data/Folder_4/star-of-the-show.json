    "About the game": "An interactive game show has surfaced on the web and you're the STAR OF THE SHOW! Investigate and even compete in the show! Be prepared, this show is life and death. Welcome to the show of a lifetime. And you, my friend. Have a front-row seat. You play as a detective assigned to a case that is more unusual than others. A monthly annual show has taken over the web. The people that host the website are disguised within a missing person case. The case was assigned to you, take it with care. Your job is to file up a report and file it over to the right department. But.. Seems the wrong people though, they have been informed about your interest in the case, they also may be interested in you as a detective. Maybe even as a contestant. The show must go on somehow. You have access to the Pursuer Browser, this will help you find the information to report. As well as a VM of your mobile phone, it has some applications that'll help you compare some information to other cases if needed. Sometimes, the hosts of the show like to hint at their next location. You can even go to that location, do some studying! Find some fingerprints, take some samples, and take them back to the station. But for now, take comfort in your own home. Be sure to watch out though, watch everything you do, and listen to everything you do. This case you do isn't like any other normal case. As we said, you're the STAR OF THE SHOW! _______________________________ Feel free to join in here!",
