    "About the game": "Station Commander is an indie, procedurally generated wave defense game. You are a Commander of a space-faring Station whose mission is to find and secure new resources for humanity. You've discovered a rich new planet... Unfortunately there are already enemy forces present on the planet. Will you focus on bombarding the enemy planet into submission quickly, or fighting off the smaller enemy craft first? Will you ignore your Station's defenses in order to focus everything you have on devastating attacks? Will you sync up your bombardment cannons into a powerful salvo that hurts you almost as much as it hurts the enemy?",
