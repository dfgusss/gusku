    "About the game": "Summary Vehicles - Use vehicles such as tanks and helicopters to destroy the enemy. Modifiable terrain - Construct or destroy terrain to your advantage. Fog of war - Out-maneuver your enemy by utilizing the fog of war. Unlocks - Each kit has a variation with some new items that can be unlocked. Expand your arsenal by unlocking new weapons with increasing experience. Squads - Invite some friends and play as a squad in intense battles. Online or LAN - Host or join games on LAN or online. Bots - Play with humans or bots. Kits - Choose between 7 different kits, each holding 5 unique items with varying tactical purposes. Conquest - Capture flags and reduce the enemy team's tickets to zero to win the battle. Tactical Items - Use smoke-grenades and flash-bangs to distract enemies in close quarters firefights. Call in air strikes using laser target designation and radio. The game was built with organic, home-grown C++ code, OpenGL and a few open source libraries by a one-man team. Though I have limited time for this, I try to update the game from time to time. I've found that the best way to play this game is to play 1on1 or more with a few bots on each team. If you try it alone you probably want to play with a few bots on your side versus many more bots. Maintain control of the most flags so the enemy tickets will bleed out. I have one server hosted in France, so if you live in Europe this should be okay, but you can always host your own LAN server. To host a public server you need to port forward: UDP Port 17112 TCP Port 17113 Discord server:",
