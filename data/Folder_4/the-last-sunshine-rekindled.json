    "About the game": "The Last Sunshine: Rekindled is an abstract shmup and rogue-lite hybrid about the heat death of the universe. Play as the last stars of legend struggling against the onslaught of darkness. Light, the glory of the stars, is fading. As we drift apart, They solidify in the void between. Distant and detached, one by one we are devoured. The darkness is coming. Take up the mantle of the stars of legend and rekindle our dying light else succumb to that which is inevitable. Features Creatures from the void beyond the stars Fight the celestial horrors of darkness, a host of sinister shadows and fiends that lurk in the space between the stars. ----- Burn brightly Customize each playthrough with an expansive passive tree, full of diverse build choices and powerful combinations to discover. Outrun the darkness and make calculated strikes like lightning, or stride into devastating fire and shrug off all but the heaviest of blows. ----- The Stars of Legend Join the fight against darkness as one of 5 unlockable characters, each with unique skills and traits. - Sol, our nearest and dearest star. - Vega, the retributor. - Titan, the behemoth. - Callidus, the evasive. - Gemini, the binary twins. ----- Rekindle the embers of creation Collect stardust and nebulous remnants to power the Stars of Legend. After each run, collected stardust is converted into experience to permanently increase stats and unlock new abilities. ----- Biomes of the void Three biomes to explore and conquer, with light and dark modes that drastically change the difficulty of the game.
