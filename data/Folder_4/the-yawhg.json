    "About the game": "The Yawhg is a one-to-four player choose-your-own-adventure game that randomizes a unique story every time you play. The evil Yawhg is returning. How will the town’s locals lead their lives in the meanwhile, and what will they do when the dreaded Yawhg finally arrives? The fate of a community hinges on the characters’ actions, and the decisions of their players. Features Stories which can be played alone, or with friends. A fully fleshed-out world, where actions can have dire consequences. A randomly generated story that's different every time you play. Gorgeous artwork by the award-winning Emily Carroll. Over 50 unique endings that can happen to every character. A haunting soundtrack by Ryan Roth, sound designer for Starseed Pilgrim.
