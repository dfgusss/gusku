    "About the game": "Welcome to Tooki’s Universe Tooki is a pretty average type of guy who likes having a few carrot beers and playing video games. Out of the blue he receives a distress call through his TV, it’s from Alenna an advanced alien bunny, she is trapped on a Luna base and needs Tooki’s help to collect enough Carrotonium to escape the immense gravity. Whether Tooki is brave or just has a total disregard for his own personal safety? He dives head first into the mysterious portal; plunging him into a super addictive and challenging adventure. Tooki will have to solve 125 Puzzles set across 5 unique and beautiful Worlds. Each world brings its own set of obstacles and dangers. You will have to help Tooki Push, Kick and explode his way past them in order to collect enough Carrotonium and save Alenna. There are perks which Tooki will find and earn along his way which help him on his adventure; he collects “Tooki Tokens” for completing achievements and Easter eggs which can be exchanged at any time for perks. (There are no in app purchases). The puzzles are very rewarding the first time you solve them, but even more so when you replay them; finding a smarter route, cutting off time, getting all the fruit bonuses and completing a puzzle with a perfect; all adds to the enjoyment.
