    "About the game": "The year is 2033. You, an ex-Marine with little opportunities left, have signed up with Utopia Arura, a large mining corporation on Mars. They have sent you to a location they have proposed but you have chosen for mining. Everything else is up to you. Mining outpost on Mars Operate a mining outpost on Mars. You start out with a small base. You can earn credits (the currency on Mars in 2033) by mining rocks around the base for ore. When you have earned enough credits, you can purchase a rover that enables you to drive out and mine rocks farther out. You can upgrade the base, build it out with more buildings, equipment, etc. There are many missions and tasks that must be performed to progress in the game and earn credits. Mine rocks The first part of the game is about mining rocks for ore. Explore the area around the station and you will find rocks that contain valuable ore. Mine the rocks and bring the ore back to the base. Rover When you have made enough credits from mining rocks, you will be able to purchase a rover vehicle. The rover enables you to drive out and mine rocks that are farther away from the base. Rua 51 underground mining facility Solar flares will periodically cause high radiation levels on the surface of Mars, since the atmosphere is thin. You need to seek shelter in the Rua 51 underground mining facility when the radiation levels get too high on the surface. Sell ore &amp; buy upgrades, equipment, repairs, etc. You can sell the ore that you mine using the management user interface at the base. Just click the 'sell ore' button, and you will sell ore at the current market price and earn credits. You can use the credits to buy upgrades, equipment, repairs, food, water, etc. Missions Go on missions to outposts, facilities, the domed colony, etc. Research tasks become available when you have upgraded your base to the highest level, and have hired a researcher. There are different tasks at different locations. Marketplace You can buy and sell ore in the marketplace when the station has been upgraded. Prices in the marketplace fluctuate, so it is possible to make or loose credits. Dust storms Dust storms can happen at any time on Mars. Dust storms are dangerous because they can be very disorienting and affect communication. You can run out of oxygen if you get lost in a dust storm. Chill out on Mars Enjoy several hours of gameplay in solitude on Mars, mining for ore, operating your base station, driving your rover, etc. This may be a good game for you if you like space games and are tired of action-packed shooting games. Utopia Planitia The game is set somewhere in Utopia Planitia on Mars. Utopia Planitia (Greek and Latin: 'Nowhere Land Plain' ) is a large plain within Utopia, the largest recognized impact basin on Mars and in the Solar System with an estimated diameter of 3,300 km. Plenty of space and opportunities for anyone who wishes to try ones luck as a prospector.",
