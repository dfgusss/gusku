    "About the game": "Choose Wisely The core of Varius is simple: match colors or die. You must change the color of your shuttle's shields to match the color of the projectile to deflect it. Features 3 Game Modes Survive: Death is always imminent as you volley an accelerating projectile. Good luck, as you attempt to fight off your inevitable end. Shatter: Deflect the projectile to destroy the bricks. Colored bricks will change the color of the projectile, while special bricks add to the chaos. Lasers, explosions, freezing, even gravity changing and being left in the darkness. Sequence: You are given a sequence of colors, which grows every round that you progress. The projectile's color will be hidden, so it is up to you to remember the sequence or be destroyed.",
