The added challenge of getting a perfect score using the least amount of moves possible will keep you busy for a long time. Getting a perfect score will not be easy to achieve and will take an absolute understanding of the game. Understanding the game is something you will have to work for, there is no writing on the wall or hints to guide you. You will have to earn it with every death. Prepare yourself. Features: -96 levels to master -Semi-linear progression system allows you to skip tougher levels and come back when your skills are sharpened -Gravity Switches, Portals, Lasers and more will interact in unexpected ways to form mind bending puzzles -Control sharing multiplayer makes it easy to enjoy the challenge with your friends -Play wherever you want with cloud saves and full controller support -19 Achievements.
