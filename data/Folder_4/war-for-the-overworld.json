    "About the game": "Tired of invading dungeons? It's time you built your own! Do you feel you’re in a slump, monotonously disembowelling evil guys in endless quests for gold and a slightly better pair of boots? Are you starting to wonder if heroics really are your calling? Then welcome to the War for the Overworld! Dungeon Management Reincarnated Excavate and build your dungeon beneath the overworld, in the modern dungeon management game that’s most faithful to the genre’s original DNA. Keep your dungeons, slap your minions, and forge underground fortresses filled with all the dastardly rooms, traps and heinous minions you desire. Do it all under the mentorship of the original and best voice of evil: Richard Ridings! Wield the Arsenal of Evil Evil loves options, and within the Veins of Evil there are plenty to go around! Choose from over sixty rooms, spells, potions, rituals, defences and constructs as you progress through the game. Deploy your fiendish tools against the goodly heroes of the overworld, and teach them the price of trespass. Conquer a Myriad of Modes With six game modes to choose from you can conquer your enemies in your own unique way. Choose from Campaign, Skirmish, Scenarios, Multiplayer, Survival, and the My Pet Dungeon expansion (free 2-level demo included in the base game), and discover what it truly means to be the bad guy. Customise, Create, and Share with Your... Enemies Build your own maps and campaigns with the intuitive and powerful Map Editor , complete with scripting support, then share them on the Steam Workshop to join the ranks of thousands of custom maps already created! Meddle further, and change the very rules themselves to your liking with dozens of mutators. Being evil has never been so creative! Made by Cultists (Fanatics), for Cultists (Fanatics) War for the Overworld is developed by an independent team of fanatical developers, each with a true love of the dungeon management genre. We have continued to update the game since launch, with countless patches, balancing, polish, and many new features. Our community has been vital to our success, and we couldn’t have made the game what it is today without their help. We thank them sincerely.",
