    "About the game": "This game depicts the post-apocalyptic world wrought out by a war among humanity. The only remnants are machines mass fabricated during the war which were designed for fighting. You are one of the sole survivors meant to wrought out the remaining robots left in the world, the only problem is that for every hostile you kill, two more respond and reinforce their army. How far can you make it? Gameplay- You will have to fend off a single, increasing, wave of robots and you have to keep up to pace in an arms race of sheer numbers versus (you) strategy and skill as you level yourself up using the scrap metal that you salvage from surrounding robots you have killed off. You will have to make sure your upgrades are balanced and well placed such that you can properly fend off the hoards of enemies.",
