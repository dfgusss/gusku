    "About the game": "WordTactics is a single-player strategic word puzzle game. You place letter tiles in a grid, then select adjacent letters to form words and score points. WordTactics is more strategic than most word puzzle games because it requires players to think critically to obtain the highest scores. If you enjoy word puzzles that are challenging and require more thought than simply hunting for words, you should try WordTactics! Compete with your Steam friends to obtain the highest score, or try to beat your own high score. How To Play Up to six letters will appear in the input tray. The player must choose where to drop the letters in a grid, which causes a new random letter to be added to the input tray. Selecting adjacent letters in the grid that spell an English word allows the player to score points based on the letters used and the length of the word. After a certain number of letters have been successfully used in words, the player advances to the next level. In each new level, a new type of letter tile with special properties is introduced. These new tiles increase the word score or create new challenges such as destroying other tiles or filling the grid. When the grid is full, no more tiles may be placed, and the game is over. Strategy Elements WordTactics permits a wide variety of strategies to obtain higher scores. Complete words can be kept in the grid rather than scored so that additional letters can be used to construct longer words. Knowledge of letter and diagram frequencies is important for anticipating possible future words and choosing the optimal placement of letters in the grid when no words can be easily spelled. Careful attention to letter point values and special tile bonuses can determine the highest scoring words from several options. The use of destructive letter tiles to destroy difficult or impossible to use tiles can prolong gameplay during the later levels where word scores are often the highest. These strategies and many others ensure will ensure that WordTactics will continue to be challenging well after your first game. Competitive Repeatable Play Even though a single WordTactics game can be completed in an hour or two, there are many opportunities for repeatable play. WordTactics supports four game lengths, ranging from as little as half-an-hour to several hours per game. As with most strategic games, practice makes perfect, and your high scores will probably improve as you play repeatedly. There are high score leader boards for each game length, allowing you to compete with your friends to see who can achieve the highest score. Or you can play against yourself, trying to beat your prior best score. Dozens of achievements provide unique challenges for completing the game under specific constraints, creating even more reasons to play WordTactics many times, for many hours of enjoyable gameplay.",
