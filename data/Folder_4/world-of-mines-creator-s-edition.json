Ever dream of saving the world? World of Mines is your chance to get rid of the world of deadly killer mines, one country at a time, 178 countries in total. Which countries will you save first and who will you leave ‘til the end? The World of Mines offers a user-generated map mode to indefinitely have new maps to resolve. HOW TO PLAY The objective of the game is to clear each country map of hidden “mines” or bombs without detonation, albeit with help from clues stating the number of neighboring mines for each tile. The player is initially presented with a world map, from which a country is chosen and played one at a time. The game is played by marking all tiles under which a mine is hidden with a flag and freeing up all tiles that do not have a mine underneath. If a tile containing a mine is revealed instead of being marked with a flag, the player loses the game. The digit displayed in tiles indicate the number of mines adjacent. / /",
