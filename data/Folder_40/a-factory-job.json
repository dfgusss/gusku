Finally you land a job at a factory, just in time because your grandmother, the most important person in your life, is not doing well and needs to have treatment quickly. Earn money by turning valves, pressing buttons, and keeping an eye on your productivity. The factory cares DEEPLY about productivity and will do anything necessary to keep their numbers up. They may offer you some special opportunities if you show your worth. It is up to you to decide just how far you will go to help the one closest to you. Make good choices, grandma knows you will.",
