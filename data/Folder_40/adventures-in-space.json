    "About the game": "The learning adventures in this science curriculum unit include the opportunity to pilot a spaceship, as well as a Mars Rover while learning some of the most important lessons about the Universe. Along the way, you will meet Wendy, the Science Teacher, who presents lessons at a high school level in a fun and impactful way. You will also meet Steve, the virtual field trip host, who teaches about the solar eclipse in real time as it occurs above you. Even more, you will drive a Rover over the surface of Mars and visit replicas of the actual U.S. Rovers intentionally left there. While traveling to distant galaxies, enjoy watching an animated short about the birth of a star. Following these VR experiences are three optional assessments for students (or parents) to measure mastery of the content. This supplement to school curriculum is based on Next Gen Science Standards so it mirrors what classrooms around the world are teaching.",
