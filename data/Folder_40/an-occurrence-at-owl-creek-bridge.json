    "About the game": "In this short 5 to 10 minute sidescrolling linear game, play as a soldier as they dream to make a daring escape. What will happen when you make a leap of faith? An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge is an adaptation of the Civil War story by the same name written by Ambrose Bierce. Besides the title screen, there are no words (spoken or written) within the game allowing the art and mechanics to tell the story. Arrow keys to play. Only one ending.",
