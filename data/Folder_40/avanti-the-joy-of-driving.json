    "About the game": "Drive a kart on different locations in first person driver view only. Try to beat the race time of other players. You can select their ghost replay and see how they drive. To be faster you can configurate different settings of your car. You can drive with keyboard (WASD or Arrow keys , R restart track , 1-9 for radio , /*-+ for volume control). Its a development focus that you can drive good with keyboard. Steering Wheel + Force Feedback and Gamepads are supported. (Gamepads are currently only used digital like keypress on/off) In moment the game is focused on singleplayer only. Multiplayer racing will maybe added later. Content can be missing, added or removed while in development. How the game looks finally at the end of the development is open. Any comments or suggestions in discussions are welcome. When you found any bugs it would be nice when you can report them in discussions.",
