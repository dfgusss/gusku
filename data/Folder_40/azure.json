    "About the game": "A final project of my college freshman year. Just jump and dash and have fun. Azure is a game that I first developed as a regular assignment for Intro to Game Development class in the second semester of my freshman year, and I decided to continue working on it for my final project. Inspired by Celeste and Hollow Knight, this game is a quite simple platformer. Players need to control the heroine named Azure to overcome obstacles in front of her. - Main features - Classical Platformer Mechanics: I implemented the double jump and dash mechanics into this game, and players basically just use them to solve problems. Traditional Eastern Aesthetics: Art is another main feature of this game. I tried to reach the level of Chinese ink paintings but failed a little bit, but still, I believe this game looks adorable. Well-made Level Design: I'm not boasting this. Both my professor and my peers praised it. 'It is difficult but you still have the motivation to continue playing.' One of my classmates said. - Yeah, these are the reasons that you should download and try my game. It's free so why not - Don't ask me what's the background story because I don't even know. Just created an adorable character and let her jump around. Probably not adorable enough cuz my drawing skill isn't that good, but I did spend tons of time on art and programming. I believe the game is free of bugs after a couple of playtesting, but just let me know if it has. By the way, the majority of this game was solely developed by myself within a month. Some other parts were done with the help of other people, and here are the credits: Background music done by Snake Logo &amp; Capsule Image done by Danfeng Yang Anyway, enjoy.",
