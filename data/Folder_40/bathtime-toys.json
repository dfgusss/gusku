    "About the game": "Bathtime Toys is a casual playground for kids, that sparks imagination and creative gameplay. Did you ever wonder how children have the power to bring their toys to life? Assemble simple, but cute 3d puzzle toys , and express yourself by coloring them. Drop them in your custom decorated bathtub , and let the fun begin! There are no hard winning, or losing rules. Interact with your toys by tapping, or dragging them around. There are over 20 toys, with multiple parts to assemble and color. When floating, some of them have funny behaviors, like sharks who like to chase the ducks, or pirate ships who may fire cannons from time to time, magnets, volley balls, cute animals, boats, floating platforms, and more. The bathtub surroundings can be decorated with over 40 models: trees, houses, grass, fences, flowers, mountains, clouds, and some interactive objects, like score counting tablets, timers, or water polo gates. Explore them all, and invent infinite funny challenges, in a way that only kids can do!",
