ABOUT THE GAMEPLAY 'They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night.' Edgar Allan Poe Like in the original graphic adventure trilogy, the Gothic Horror genre and its unique atmosphere of madness and psychological distress remains at the heart of Black Mirror. The point-and-click gameplay of the original trilogy served as the basis for the re-imagined gameplay, which focuses on close-up investigation and interaction with nightmarish visions that plague the protagonist of the game David Gordon. ABOUT THE ORIGINAL TRILOGY 'No man can choose his death.' Detective Collier, Black Mirror (2003) In the original adventure trilogy, Samuel Gordon and Darren Michaels search for the truth behind the Curse of the Black Mirror that has haunted the Gordon-family for generations. The acclaimed original trilogy laid the foundation Black Mirror (2017) is built upon. Dense gothic horror atmosphere, rich visual details and a dark story full of characters who are not what they seem to be - the journey of Samuel Gordon and Darren Michaels is as captivating today as it was when the games were first released.",
