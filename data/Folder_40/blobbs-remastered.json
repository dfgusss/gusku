    "About the game": "Rebuilt from the ground up in a brand new engine with fully remastered graphics, improved animations, new visual effects and a brand new soundtrack. Blobbs: Remastered combines simple but addictive gameplay, colourful and cartoony visuals, witty humour and ever so satisfying popping sounds. Ping, pop, zap, freeze and even explode your way through real time puzzles, attempting to create spectacular chain reactions in order to clear the screen in as few clicks as possible. The Base Game contains: Remastered Level Pack - 50 puzzling levels to solve, combining 40 of the best levels from the original 2 games with 10 brand new ones. 16 unique and varied types of Blobbs (Including 4 new ones). Face off against Ninjas, Ghosts, Armoured Blobbs and even ones that can create blackholes! New Boss Levels featuring special boss enemies, cut from the original games but now fully realised for the remaster. 28 Ingame (and Steam) Achievements to unlock. A simple to use level editor with Steam Workshop integration. Once you're done with the Remastered level pack, browse a gallery of player created levels or jump into the Editor and build your own. With Steam Workshop support, making and sharing your levels with the world is quick, simple and surprisingly fun. Check out the Blobbs: Elemental Mayhem and Blobbs: Mad Science Level Pack DLCs which each add an additional 50 levels to play and new bosses to encounter. Or consider purchasing the Complete Edition bundle and get the base game plus both Level Packs at a discounted price over buying each item individually.",
