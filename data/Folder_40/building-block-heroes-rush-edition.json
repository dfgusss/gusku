    "About the game": "Building Block Heroes: Rush Edition is a faster-paced stand-alone expansion for Building Block Heroes, made for those who enjoyed the core mechanics of the original but did not want to commit to a longer gameplay experience. Building Block Heroes is a puzzle block platformer in which you use coloured blocks to build pathways around each level to free the Jollyfolk from their cages. Simultaneously control both building blocks and heroes, with a friend or by yourself, in this colourful romp through a cartoony and exotic hand-painted world. Explore different lands and make use of special powers as you construct the means to save the Jollyfolk! A True Puzzle Platformer Game Use falling blocks to build your own platforms and pathways around over 100 levels! Build your own stairways and bridges to navigate around obstacles and pits! Each area in the game introduces a new challenge - from moving platforms to irresistible ocean currents that sweep you away, no two areas are alike! Compete for higher scores and beat your own personal records! Characters Four unique characters, each with their own unique abilities! Destroy blocks to build up your power meter. Dash across gaps as Heatwave, conjure blocks of ice as Ice Queen, soar through the air as Airhead, or smash through blocks as Dirtbag!",
