    "About the game": "ClockwiZZZe is a casual puzzle game. It's up to you to lead a sleepwalking dwarf back to his bed while trying to take as much gold as you can. Gold is needed to access new maps. Both the enemies and the dwarf turn clockwise when they hit an object, wall or door, and by opening and closing doors you can affect their path. Maps are procedurally generated, so each playthrough is different. You can solve each level in multiple ways. When you feel confident about your solution, you can press fast forward to speed things up. Enjoy and welcome to the ClockwiZZZe addiction! :)",
