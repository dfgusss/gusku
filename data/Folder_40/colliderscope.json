    "About the game": "Push your brain to the limits as you push blocks around. Colliderscope is a peacefully infuriating puzzle game where you push and pull blocks to form specific shapes. Over the course of Colliderscope's 50 levels, you will push, pull, and shape blocks to solve puzzles that boggle the mind while listening to a tranquil piano score. Using a flexible first person interface, Colliderscope requires that you look at its puzzles from all angles in order to solve them. Colliderscope is a pure puzzle game without story or filler. It was designed to provide a focused, challenging experience without additional padding to increase play time. Average puzzle players can expect to spend about 3-4 hours to complete all 50 puzzles. Colliderscope will challenge you to look at blocks in a whole new way.",
