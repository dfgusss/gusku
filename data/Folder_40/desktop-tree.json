    "About the game": "Grow a tree on your desktop, just like your potted plants on your real desktop, but you don't need to take care of it like in real life. This game means to provide a causual and relaxing experience. You can leave the tree on your desktop while doing other jobs, watching a video or surfing the internet. You can also shear unwanted branches to make it better(or smaller). Hint : Catch random bugs on the desktop to make the tree grow faster! How to play? To open the menu, press Esc. To move the pot, click on it and drag. To cut branches, hold Ctrl and click on the branch. To zoom in, hold Ctrl and use the mouse wheel. To move the pot slightly when zoomed, hold Ctrl and press arrows keys.",
