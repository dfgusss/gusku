    "About the game": "Eat Your Words is a fun game for people that love word games. It is a unique mashup of a traditional word puzzle game and a candy/gem collecting game. I've worked in the video game industry for many years. Eat Your Words is my first independent game on Steam. I am making games that I like to play. If you love word games, I think you'll like this one. I would love to hear your feedback via email or in the discussion forums. FEATURES • Four game modes. • 100 levels to challenge your wordliness. • Quick game or relaxing game; your choice! • New game boards every day. • Huge word list. • Integrated dictionary with multiple word definitions. • Detailed statistics. • Steam Leaderboards. • Steam Achievements. The goal of the game is to find as many words as you can on the game board. Each word must be at least 3 letters, and you can't use the same word twice. Every word generates sushi pieces. Match 3 sushi pieces to clear them off the board. There are four modes of play: Play (Default Mode) has 100 levels for your to master. Daily Game gives you unlimited time on a game board that changes every day. Free Play always gives you the same board layout, but the letters change each time you play. Blitz is a quick pace game with a 2 minute time limit. The game board changes every day.",
