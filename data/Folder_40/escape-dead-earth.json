    "About the game": "Earth is dead. Only robots and you, a powerful AI, remain. Take control of a robot horde as you fight your way across a harsh and unforgiving landscape of forests and decayed cities. Grow your army from fallen enemies as you try to Escape Dead Earth! Escape Dead Earth is a fast-paced, casual strategy game for Windows and Mac. Starting with only a handful of weak robots, you must choose your battles carefully. Each robot you destroy can be reassembled and absorbed into your own army, growing your robot horde as you conquer your way across the map. But watch out, enemies get stronger, smarter, and more dangerous as you head towards your goal: a rocket that will take you far away from Earth. Escape Dead Earth uses radically simple two-button mouse controls to keep you focused on fast-paced action. VICE Magazine recommends Escape Dead Earth: 'an RTS Where Deathballs Are the Only Tactic'! Read the full review here: -dead-earth-deathball-microstrategy-rts . Now available on Steam in English, Spanish, Traditional Chinese (Mandarin), and Simplified Chinese!",
