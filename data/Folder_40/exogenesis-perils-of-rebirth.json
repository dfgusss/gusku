    "About the game": "Inspired by Zero Escape and Ace Attorney games, Exogenesis ~Perils of Rebirth~ is a massive epic ADVENTURE GAME/VISUAL NOVEL HYBRID which combines the point-and-click gameplay of adventure games with the heavy focus on storytelling found in visual novels. The world has ended. From the ashes of war, mankind struggles to survive under the tight grip of a mysterious organization known as Sanctus Ordo Illuminatus. Some are starting to rebel, thus creating a revolutionary force called God's People Army. It's 2069 - Yudai Sayashi’s ragtag group of treasure hunters, Durchhalten, faces tragedy. The greatest treasure of all - the 'Golden Dream' - is within their reach. But Yu's sister Miho runs into a deadly trap and everything falls apart. Two years later, Yu comes across a startling discovery. The mythical Noah’s Ark, borne of legend by those who believe the Old World can be restored, turns out to be real. Yu learns about the existence of the Lazarus Protocol inside Noah's Ark – a system that can recreate anything from the past – and goes on a search for the Ark, believing Miho can be brought back to life. Before setting out to find the Ark, however, Yu must reunite the now defunct Durchhalten. The group had disbanded after the tragic incident, and he wants everyone to be there when Miho opens her eyes once more. Many hours of gameplay - A full-length adventure several novels long, a world to explore, as well as numerous puzzles to solve. Acquire and use character profiles and evidence to convince or coerce. Challenging major escape room-style puzzles and fun little ones. Over 100 animated characters that move and talk, populating an expansive game world and intricately woven into a deep plot. Important moral choices that affect how the story plays out. High replay value with multiple endings and branching story paths. Memorable cast of characters whose fates are determined by your decisions. Stunning animated rendition of post-apocalyptic Japan with real-life landmarks. Mystery sci-fi larger than life elements for you to find out. Mind-boggling, thematic puzzles - Contextual puzzles that make sense to the game world and aren't just there for the heck of it. Character interrogation - Gather physical and circumstantial evidence and use those as leverage in recruiting your former comrades.",
