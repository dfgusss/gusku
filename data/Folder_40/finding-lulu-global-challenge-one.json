    "About the game": "Based on two characters, Amy and Lulu, the game scene is set out in Vellar County. After an invasion by other world life forms that wiped out the entire population, Amy and Lulu are the sole survivors of the Alien encounter. Lulu, the younger of the two, frightened by the whole ordeal, has isolated herself and gone into hiding. She is aware that Amy has also survived. Vellar County is split into three islands: Suburbs, Metropolis and Farmlands. You are required to locate all 10 gold coins that are hidden across these three settings. 4 in the Suburbs, 3 in the city, and 3 in the Farmlands. This will unlock Lulu's location and you will then be required to search for her in all three islands. Once you locate her, Lulu will give you a Victory Code that you will then submit to Vellar International's website for the challenge to officially end. Your progress is saved and shown on the upper left corner of the gameplay screen. Being a Global Challenge, Vellar International seeks to give back to its community of players. Therefore, to make things a little more interesting and fun, there is a giveaway to the first player who successfully completes the game and submits the Victory Code. The specified amount is stated on our website, at www.vellar.org , in the Games page, just before the purchase button. Kindly read through the legal document provided on the same page before purchasing the game. The initial giveaway amount is $1000, and will change incrementally as more players join the challenge.",
