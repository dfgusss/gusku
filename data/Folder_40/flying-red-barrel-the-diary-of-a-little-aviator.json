As though no such thing had ever been uttered, mankind has now gained its wings. What people dreamed of as children is the reality of today. Everyone reaches out for the sky together, carrying their wishes upon their wings. With the rapid development of flight technology, an organization called the 'Blue Sky Union' was established to maintain the order of the sky under law. People now call it 'the Guild.' Ten years have passed since, and the Guild is at last about to put an end to the prolonged anarchy of the sky. This is a story of one of the aviators living in that era.
