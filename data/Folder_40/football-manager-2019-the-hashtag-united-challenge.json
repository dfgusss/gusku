    "About the game": "The Football Manager 2019 Hashtag United Challenge brings you closer to the club than ever before. Take control of the Yellow and Blue as they embark on Chapter 2 – their debut season in the English football pyramid. Created in conjunction with the Thurlow Nunn Eastern Senior League, the brand-new Division One South is licensed and fully playable, allowing you to battle for the inaugural title either as Hashtag United or one of their rivals. We have worked very closely with Hashtag and the league to generate authentic player data, to give fans the immersive experience Football Manager is known for. Your Hashtag heroes should feel familiar with regards to their strengths, weaknesses and unique attributes. Managers are limited to one league and one season, but other than that this is a fully-playable version of Football Manager 2019 – including the brand new tactical setup, training revamp and new manager induction system. Put your own stamp on Hashtag and get them playing your way. You won’t be able to bring them to Division One South, but the world’s best footballers are in the scouting pool, allowing you to dream ahead to a day when Hashtag could be in the mix for their signatures. For the time being you’ll have to navigate through the bargain basement, where there’s plenty of options to strengthen your squad if you so desire. With Hashtag currently riding high in the league, the question remains – can you take them all the way?",
