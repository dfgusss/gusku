    "About the game": "In Funkyland a certain harmony has long existed between species. So much so that cross-breeding is quite common throughout the land. In fact, hybrid animals now rule all its three kingdoms. Recently, the King of Ducks has been pronounced ill and his exiled brother, the King of Dragons, sits upon his throne. A team of the best doctors are dispatched to help, but when none return the King of Fur becomes restless. Take the wheel as nimble King Grolar in an adventure to find them all. Funky Karts is a continuous motion platformer with 64 dazzling levels full of prickly obstacles and pesky robots.",
