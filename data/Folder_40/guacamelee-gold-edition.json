    "About the game": "Guacamelee! Gold Edition is a Metroidvania-style action-platformer set in a magical Mexican-inspired world. The game draws its inspiration from traditional Mexican culture and folklore, and features many interesting and unique characters. Guacamelee! builds on the classic open-world Metroidvania style of games by adding deep melee combat, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative local multiplayer. The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many moves useful and necessary for both. Travel through a mystical and mysterious Mexican world as a luchador using the power of your two fists to battle evil. Uncover hidden wrestling techniques like the Rooster Uppercut, and Dimension Swap to open new areas and secrets.
