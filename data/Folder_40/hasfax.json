    "About the game": "Unfamiliar place and memory loss. What would you do if you were in that position? Find out the true reason for your appearance here or just run away. Remember, looks are deceiving ... You wake up in the basement, get up, and after a few seconds your ears start ringing. You are trying to remember what happened and understand how you ended up here, but don’t remember anything. Looking around you can see only one thing - blood. By simple assumptions and answers hidden around you, as parts of a puzzle, you will at least learn what the “Kidnapper” expects from you. Looking even further you can find out the reason for your appearance and what is happening to you. Understand what is happening or escape - the choice is yours. EXPLORE TO FIND THE TRUTH Everything is interconnected, all separate parts lead to the main thing. LACK OF MEMORY AND FULL DISORIENTATION Up in a strange place and discovering a lack of memory, what to do is up to you. No points or hints, just run away or look for information that tells the essence of what is happening. IRREVERSIBLE CONSEQUENCES In order to understand me, you must feel what i feel… Illness eats me from the inside.",
