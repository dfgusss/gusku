    "About the game": "HB&amp;P is an old-school RPG game that uses an 80s/90s style of design and concept. Your decisions will determine the ending of each adventure you take. Every story has different and random components. This means that the stories will vary from game to game. Even though HB&amp;P is an 80s/90s style game, we have taken the liberty of saving you from having to read the boring endless story paragraphs. Here is how we begin. You, the player, will generate a character from a series of available classes which enters a medieval fantasy world. During the initial launch of the game, six classes will be available: Warrior, Wizard, Rogue, Bard, Necromancer and Priest. In addition to this, there are two more classes that will be added in the future. This world is made up of stories. These stories are completely replayable, since they are based on player's decisions, their character, their skills and items. To add to this, all the stories have a procedural component that generates different places, encounters, characters, traps, combats or random loot, even if you replay the same story with the same character! Some stories may also change their storyline each time you play them again. You will not play two identical adventures. The adventures can be completed in the order you chose, and each time you play one of them you can choose between 6 different difficulty modes. You can adjust the difficulty of the game to your liking individually for each adventure. The character will earn experience points and be able to level up, so in the next adventure your character will be stronger. There is no proper level system and your character will improve the characteristics that you want, to the limit that you desire. This will allow you to configure your character to your liking. For example, it is possible to get a Warrior-Wizard if you manage to obtain enough value in a certain characteristic, and you find the appropriate spells or items. Although there is a road map, this game is open to any suggestions from the players and the community in hopes of making improvements wherever needed. HEROES OF BOOK &amp; PAPER is a game for those who once enjoyed reading gamebooks and still let their imagination run wild. Thank you for reading - HEROES OF BOOK &amp; PAPER -",
