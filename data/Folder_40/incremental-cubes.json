    "About the game": "This is a simple but very deep incremental game! All you need is to collect more cubes and keep going! 〇Overview Collect cubes, defeat enemies, and advance through the tiers. 〇Simple Upgrades Each cube has an upgrade that reduces the interval at which the cubes fall. 〇Prestige Prestige will reset all your progress, but it boosts the progress dramatically. You can buy a lot of skills from a 3D-like skill tree! The skill points needed to buy skills can be gained by attacking enemies. 〇Helpers As you progress through the game, helpers who will attack enemies and collect cubes for you will appear. 〇Boss Battle As you progress through the game, bosses will appear periodically. Bosses are hard to beat, but when you beat them, your current cube will change into a larger one. In addition, you can earn more skill points than usual. 〇Challenge Challenge mode will be unlocked as you progress through the game. Clearing challenges will give you super bonuses that will help you advance in the game. 〇Controls Mouse only.",
