    "About the game": "Three stories, three outcasts, three nerds… and a single destiny: to make the best video game ever . This is the basic premise of Indiecalypse , JanduSoft’s upcoming release, sadly based on actual events. Indiecalypse depicts the crude reality of indie game developers and their struggles to get their shit together when it comes to releasing a video game. Three misfits team up to design and produce their own indie game, finding themselves in a path of chaos, self-destruction and resentment. But there’s also space for crude humor, pop culture references, gratuitous and non-gratuitous violence... and fear. Fear of the dozens of lawsuits for copyright infringement, obscenity and profanity we’ll have to face if the game is finally published. It sounds wonderful, but… How do I play Indiecalypse? In Indiecalypse we'll play as Jack Jackson (programming), Ethan Wornick (music) and Violet Oakly (art), and live their own particular stories. The game's main mechanic is based on modern exploration/adventure games, but Indiecalypse also includes more than 20 mini-games, most of them copied, sorry, based (let's say inspired by...) some of the most popular games and mechanics in video game history. Check them out below! Not everything is what it seems in Indiecalypse, and we know for sure that no one will be left indifferent after playing it. What are you waiting for? Join this epic adventure. Features: The definitive Indie Developer Experience More than 20 mini-games, most of them inspired by well-know indie games Different playable characters: Jack, Ethan &amp; Violet A lot of Cinematics Dark Humor",
