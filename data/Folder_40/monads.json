    "About the game": "'With tactics only, a story of solitary people.' This is a turn-based tactics game with No Grinding, No item. Test your ability and break through 21 prepared stages. Diverse view No single protagonist, but every chapter has own protagonist as different character. You can escape from a dangerous trap on a fugitive's view, then search the fugitive's azit on a chaser's view. This presentation will provide satisfaction that you are looking at the events comprehensively. 20 main characters who work together and become hostile to each other for their own purposes, whom will you like the most? Mercy &amp; Will There's not only a way to fight against an enemy that kills its purpose. Enemy runs away when it is in danger. Going through a mental breakdown, such as killing an enemy or getting hurt in battle, will make a cut at its will and the character will become obtuse. Depending on the character's nature, the effects of certain factors may be greater or less. More sophisticated planning will be needed to minimize both sides' sacrifices and maintain the character's mental capacity. Never do grinding It's a fascinating experience to have stronger powers than before, but it's not only too boring but meaningless to repeat the same battles dozens of times. Rewards will only be given if you open up a new story or break a new record. Difficulties Tactics is an important part of Monads , but you can play it the way you want even if you don't want to use your head in the game. It offers a wide range of difficulties from 'Intro' for who wants only to enjoy the story, to 'Legend' for who loves hardcore tactical games.",
