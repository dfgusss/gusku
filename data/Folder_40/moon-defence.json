    "About the game": "It's a single-player shooter featuring old-school steady style, destructible buildings, stubborn enemies and twilight landscapes of biggest moons of Solar System planets. Your turret is a remade crane. Your weaponry - hastily redesigned plasmatron, laboratory laser and experimental energy absorber. Your opponents are awaken Wardens. Energy is strictly limited, plasma reload in the lull only, surviving is a real victory . In this dangerous journey you step from one moon to another with an uncertain outcome. Stand still and shoot straight all the enemies. Control a replenishable energy budget, pump your weapon, research artifacts. And perhaps you shouldn’t destroy a monoliths . Key Features Extremely simple game mechanic Tactical variety Unique landscapes of biggest moons across Solar System Ability to create a defensive infrastructure and customizable turret armament Bonus levels on every planet system Plot Year 2061. Weaponry rusts in museums. Earthlings have forgotten the wars as they master the Solar System. Science labs and industrial bases are posted wherever a human feet can step. Once the communication with farther settlements has lost. The colonies evaporate one by one. From the ripped reports it becomes clear that unknown agressors cruelly eradicate all of the colonists. Nobody can perceive the motivation of attackers. Since the metropolis is too far, it can't help fast enough. Settlers must construct weapon of everything they have. Plasmagenerators, mining lasers were welded on the excavator cabin, it was mounted on the turret and reliably buried in the ground close to base. The remainings of earthlings on Pluto, Saturn, Mars, Moon and other are resourceful and fearless. Desperate defense turns into encouraging struggle. It’s time to choose your way to protect, banish or collapse.",
