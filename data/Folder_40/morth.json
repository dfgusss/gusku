The game will take approximately 15 minutes to complete with two possible endings and multiple playthroughs may be required to accomplish the desired ending. features *Classic choose-your-own-adventure gameplay *Chiptune Soundtrack *Skill-check systems allows for varied gameplay *Solve a Medieval Mystery!",
