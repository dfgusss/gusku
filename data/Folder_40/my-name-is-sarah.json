    "About the game": "● When you wake up, you're in a place you never knew, in the middle of the forest! You have no idea how you got here. You're scared! You must hurry up! Before it gets dark, you should find something to eat, drink water and a place to stay! You need exploration to get out of here by finding your way out. Then produce something to defend yourself! Maybe someday you will be able to unravel this secret! ● Are you ready for a mysterious journey with Sarah? It is a little difficult to survive in this forest. You must collect a lot of food, produce tools to defend yourself, and build a place or accommodation. A place to host will provide you with many possibilities. Remember, you have no map! So try to keep the signs in mind! If you are a little lucky, maybe you can find a map and get rid of it much faster. Properties: ● Stock! Don't go exploring without stocking food, building a place, and producing something to defend. ● Hint! Take into account the pollen. ● Craft! You can diversify production with food and the ingredients you collect. ● Residential! You can camp anywhere as long as you find the right spots. ● Mystery! Be careful where you discover! Maybe there may be hidden things you need to find there. ● Strategy! When you're on reconnaissance, avoid fighting as much as possible. ● Upgrade! By upgrading the shelter you built, you can make it stronger. ● Discovery! Sounds or creatures in the forest may be guiding you.",
