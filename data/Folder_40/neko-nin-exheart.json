    "About the game": "INTERESTING FEATURES LIKE MOVING CAT EARS! Japan. From time immemorial, there are those who possess superhuman abilities. These beings who looked like a cross between man and beast are called Demi-Humans. They acted as Ninja and served those in power. And so time passes to present day—— “We have come from the Fuuma Village to fulfill an ancient contract. To serve you! Nin♪” Yura and Tama. These ninja cats made their dynamic entrance. These cats approached our hero with their loving aura in full bloom. Their adorability and will causes our hero to be taken by them. But how will he support them? How on earth do you use ninja in this day and age? As he ponders this question, the sense of being a master begins to sprout in our hero when he interacts with these lovely cats. But who is spying on them from the shadows…? A heartfelt tale of cat ninjas who won’t shut up about loyalty. With a bit of action thrown in the mix.",
