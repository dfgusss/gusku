    "Release date": "May 4, 2020",
    "About the game": "A tongue-in-cheek 1980s revenge story! You play as the foul-mouthed superhero, Night Jackal, as he takes to the streets on a revenge-fueled rampage to mow down a crime syndicate responsible for murdering his wife. So, what does daddy get? Play Arcade style or the NEW Casual game! - Whether you're looking for the pulse pounding fun only found within the 80s arcade machines or a lazy romp through the 8-bit landscape, we've got you covered! Both action AND racing! - Race to reach checkpoint before time runs out while blasting enemies in Anubis, aka the Jackal Mobile! Varied enemies - Take on a motley gang of enemies, each with their own unique abilities and weapons. You'll need to learn their weaknesses or accept certain defeat! Diverse courses - Blast your way through bustling cityscapes, eerie wastelands, slippery snow-covered tundras, and more! Explore all SIX locations, each with three different versions to keep replayabiliy high. Multiple vehicles - Get behind the wheel of three custom Night Jackal vehicles! Each with their own unique playing experience. Casual Drive - Select the casual drive option to remove enemies and any punishment for killing civilians. That's right, feel free to unleash your inner a**hole! Punishingly 80s hard - Just like the retro arcade games of the 1980s, this game gets progressively difficult as you play. How long can you last? Local and online leaderboards - Track your personal best and see how you fair against the online community! Original music - Jam out to the super cheesy main 80s theme (yet amazingly catchy) as well as the custom 8-bit tracks during gameplay! All original characters - A profane and ridiculous ensemble of original characters created for this game's universe! Homages - There are countless homages from an iconic time traveling car from an 80s movie to references to old video games. How many can you spot? Adult themed - This ain't a game for the kiddos, Bub. It contains naughty language, adult themes, and a really puerile sense of humor that's almost always in bad taste. Censored version - Don't want all the blood and sexual innuendos? Or the 'trying too hard' edgy voice over? That's cool, we're not offended. We have that option, too. Compatible with PS4 controller - Plug and play with the PS4 controller! (Be sure the PS4 controller support is turned off in Steam's controller settings) Authentically retro! - Coded from a core module similar to OpenGL, this game uses math concepts implemented in Pseudo 3D games drawn in 2D vector space back in the 80s and 90s. The game is presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio like the old CRT monitors found in arcade consoles for that authentic retro feel!",
