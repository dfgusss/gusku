    "About the game": "Overlay Studio brings desktop personalisation to the next level! Decorate your monitor with various types of static and animated overlays. Download overlays from your favourite series or games from the Steam Workshop and combine them to make your own unique presets. Cannot find the overlay you want? Overlay Studio allows you to create your own overlays and share them with the world using the Workshop. Create your own video or picture overlays from existing sources. Full support for transparent PNGs, GIFs and WEBMs. Contains an overlay library to keep track of all your created and downloaded overlays. Possibility to add up to 100 active overlays to your screen. Save your favourite overlay combinations by creating presets. Share your overlays with the world using the Steam Workshop. Support for multiple displays. Adjustable settings to change the graphics performance. Ability to easily move, size, rotate and flip overlays while in editing mode. Overlays can be made partially transparent so that it is still possible to see the working area behind them. Ability to quickly hide all overlays. Overlay Studio is still in early access and that means more features are coming in the future! Two of the main additions that will be released before leaving early access are an overlay editor and scripting support. The overlay editor will make it possible for anyone to easily create their own custom overlays &amp; effects. This editor will then be extended with scripting support such that it is also possible to create interactive overlays that respond to user interaction. Our main goal with Overlay Studio is as follows. We want to create an application that can be used by anybody to customize their desktop with overlays, while at the same time exposing a large overlay creation toolbox for creators to use. If you want to be involved in the future of Overlay Studio, you can join us on Discord !",
