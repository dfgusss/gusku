    "About the game": "Patterna is a logic puzzle game for people who think that HexCells is far too easy. It features a highly customizable random level generator, a level editor, more than 70 levels, and an enchanting minimalist soundtrack by Alex Cottrell. In Patterna, each level is a network of nodes (also known as a graph ). In a way similar to HexCells or Minesweeper, each node is ultimately in one of two states (known as pattern and non-pattern ). Initially, most nodes' states are unknown. It is the player's task to correctly classify these unrevealed nodes using information based on distance, connectivity, and color. Correctly classifying a node may reveal more information that in turn helps you to solve the level. More than 70 levels, plus a tutorial Procedurally generated levels with plenty of options for the level generator Enchanting minimalist original soundtrack by Alex Cottrell Absolutely no guessing needed",
