    "About the game": "The 'Osyaberi! Horijyo!' series is finally coming to Steam! Join your favorite chatterbox, Anna Holinski, on her adventures through ruins around the world! This game also features the series' unique equipment upgrading system! Anna Holinski embarks on a relic thievery investigation, unearthing all kinds of ores and valuables to upgrade her equipment. Her attack power, jumps, energy, and other stats will get stronger with each upgrade. The game's difficulty is balanced so that anyone can clear it through replaying and upgrading equipment, so if you find yourself between a rock and a hard place, upgrades are the way to go! Of course, an 'Osyaberi!' game would be incomplete without tons of fully voiced content, and this one is no exception! Even the new characters like the leader of a mysterious organization 'Collector Jean', the equipment upgrading shopkeeper 'Inari', and more will come to life with fully voiced interactions! 'Pixel Game Maker Series' is a series where you can enjoy games created using the action game production software ' Pixel Game Maker MV'.",
