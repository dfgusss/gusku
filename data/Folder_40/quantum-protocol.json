    "About the game": "Build your deck as you go in this challenging card game. Take on multiple scenarios. Some will be quick puzzles, others will be long tests of endurance. You'll need to spend as much time planning your approach as executing it. Change Your Deck. At Any Time. Adapt to any situation quickly. But be careful, enemies will adapt as well. Break Any System. Even the Game Itself. Cards are your hacking tools. With so many to choose from, no two runs will be the same. Behind Every Program, A Dream. Experience the lives of the people behind the code. Even as an unstoppable computer virus threatens to destroy the modern world, sometimes the most important problems are the ones hidden inside each of us.",
