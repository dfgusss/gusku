    "About the game": "Race to Kyiv is a little meme-game about a farmer who got tired of the 'Bad BoyZ' invading his country. As a driver, you get into a tractor and race to Kyiv to help and defend your main Grain sale point. Your rusty but trusty tractor is armed with heavy weaponry to defend yourself from the invaders. As you Race to Kyiv, more and more enemy tanks will be blocking your way in an attempt to stop you. Dodge enemy shells, avoid tanks blocking the road, and gain higher score to prove who's the most skilled Warrior-Farmer of the Oblast. This is a little arcade-styled race game; Do not expect AAA-grade product. The options are very simple, and so are the controls. Your vehicle accelerates forward and you're only responsible for steering the wheel of the tractor and shooting its gun - everything packed in a simple third-person perspective so you can appreciate the glory of your old vehicle. Prove your worth and reach Kyiv before the Grain sale point is destroyed!",
