    "About the game": "Rage Among the Stars is heavily inspired by old school rage inducing platformers. The old school graphics, the sharp soundtrack, even small details like the death counter are meant to immerse you into the full Rage Game experience. The idea is to present a real challenge in contrast with the increasingly easier games that are filling the market. And that challenge is very real. Completing all 40 lvls on Rage Among the Stars is no easy task. There are devious traps, near impossible jumps, mighty bosses, and not as many checkpoints as you might like. In conclusion, it has everything you need to feel proud about finishing every level. The story of the game starts with our alien friend getting back home after finishing his job in the alien factory. After a weird malfunction his ship crash landed on an extrange place filled with hazards. It’s your job to help him go through his perilous journey home. It’s ok if you’re not an expert on platformers. We added a couple of features to let you enjoy the game either way. If you want the challenge, but are having trouble with your skills the Ghost Mode will be there for you. Being able to watch your best runs is a great well to polish your skills. Now, if you’re just looking to enjoy the awesome artwork and soundtrack of the game without too much rage you can always try the easy mode. A few less traps and a couple more safe platforms can make a huge difference.",
