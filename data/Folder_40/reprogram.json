    "About the game": "Reprogram is a side scrolling tactical game where timing is as important as positioning. You control the characters by assigning commands that will be performed simultaneously during a turn. That way, you'll have to learn the enemy's behaviour and think ahead when creating a strategy. The story is about four guys trapped inside a truck with a bomb hidden somewhere, they are also being chased by terrorists for a reason they don't know, but fortunately, whoever put them there gave them a marked map and remote controlled robots to help protect themselves. Throughout the game, they will try to find a way to get out of the truck, escape the terrorists, discover who put them there, reach the marked location and deal with each other. Features: 90+ different moves unique to each robot Lots of items and equipments Skippable cutscenes between battles Each enemy has its own unique behaviour 30+ battles",
