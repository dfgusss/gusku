    "About the game": "RigIT is a 3D computer graphics animation tool that automatically rigs skeletons from an animation library to 3D meshes from 3D mesh libraries. RigIT is a fast, high resolution, near pose, automatic rigger that can rig skeletons to meshes with or without well-defined interiors. It allows you to import skeletons and animations from Motion Capture (.bvh) files and automatically rigs them to objects imported from Wavefront (.obj) files that contain a single object mesh. These rigged meshes can then be exported to a Collada (.dae) file. RigIT is designed to decrease time to market costs by reducing the time requirement for, and simplifying the process of, assigning animations to computer graphics. System requirements: Operating system: Windows 7 or later Key product features: Automatic rigging of skeletons to meshes To see tutorials on how to use RigIT see: For more information see our website: / To download Blender for free visit: /",
