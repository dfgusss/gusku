    "About the game": "Run Prop, Run! is a multiplayer hide'n'seek game. It is inspired by the classic Prop Hunt mod where players must disguise themselves as an object in the scenery to avoid detection by a hunter. Run Prop, Run! can have up to 12 players and begins with one Hunter trying to catch other hiding Prop players. As each Prop gets caught, they will turn into Hunters making it more and more difficult for the remaining Props to survive the hunt. To help the Props survive, they are given the ability to transform into any object in the stage so they can better blend into the environment. When a Hunter captures a prop, it turns it into a Hunter. Start 1 Hunter VS 11 Props, and finish with up to 11 Hunters VS 1 prop! It's not just Prop Hunt Hide and Seek. There's a lot of mechanics revolving around platforming, abilities, and strategy!",
