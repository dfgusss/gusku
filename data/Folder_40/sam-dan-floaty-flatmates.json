    "About the game": "Sam &amp; Dan: Floaty Flatmates is a co-op VR game where communication and teamwork is key. You are playing as Sam or Dan, one of the two survivors trapped in your apartment because of a major world flood. Your buddy is trapped in a different building across the street, work together to get supplies to build a bridge towards a boat. Find tools to make communication easier, like a tin can, that can be used as a can phone. Also avoid falling in the water, there’s a big shark! This is the main mode of the game. You start in the middle of the apocalyptic storm. You start with nothing, search for weapons and tools in order to build the bridge and make a new apocalypse buddy! A completed game can take up to an hour to finish. When you've reached the end there is still time for some easter egg hunting. This mode is all about murder, quickly build a bridge before your enemy does, so you can reach the bow and start firing arrows into his face. Rounds are quick, practice your aim. The game is completely free to play, if you want to support us it can be done by buying the DLC which is purely cosmetic. Your support will be rewarded with a sweet in-game partyhat and you'll be greeted with the power of confetti rain. Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
