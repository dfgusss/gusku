Their lives intersect at different points as each character faces their own complex issues. Isabella, dubbed the 'nerd' of the school, is being bullied by Oakley, a problematic kid in her grade. Taylor struggles with his grades, anxiety, and pressure from his family to do well in school. London is navigating depression and grief, while trying to keep up with her job as a middle school teacher. Learn each character's fears and face off against bullies, hurled insults, inner demons, grade monsters &amp; more. Seek comfort in each character's favorite item.
