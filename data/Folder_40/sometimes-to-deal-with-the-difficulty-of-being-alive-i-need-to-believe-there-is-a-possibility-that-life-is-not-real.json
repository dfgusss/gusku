    "Release date": "May 22, 2019",
    "About the game": "**This current version is for an exhibition at Denny Dimin gallery in New York from May 23-June 30, 2019** This software is morphable to what you want it to be. It can be a small database of games, a downloadable art show, a simulation, a moving painting, an album, an existential crisis, a talisman, a play, a meditation, a spell, a forest, a distopian nightmare, a joke. The amount of interaction and exploration is not a ton. If you explore and play through everything it would take maybe an hour or so at most. -There are small games and walking sims to play on machines in abandoned buildings. -You can chat with other players in the multiplayer mode and see if they are human or machine -There is a band and a small secret lair -There is no beginning or end -There is no winning or losing And there is an infinite, dramatic cycle of accumulation and destruction: Hit the number 3 key. You can choose the perspective of 3 NPC actors or a stage overview. They are acting out an absurdist play. They are the sole survivors of a human apocalypse. They are trying to procreate to start civilization over again but they’re having a hard time. They are sending emails to nowhere, gossiping, meditating, taking naps, cleaning up. They’re collecting artifacts around the stage and building a machine. When the machine is done it generates an AI and then blows up. To see what the NPCs do you can leave the simulation on at a party, in a room while you are doing other things, etc. It could run for many hours and you will see, read and hear different things. If you have a few computers you can link them up and see different perspectives at once. With multiple channels of the atmospheric sounds it becomes a sort of instrument or generative album as well. Before you download, I encourage you to download the 100+ page manual which I am giving away for free. Click the “View the manual” on the right hand side of this page and download it.

If you’re looking for some fun, addicting type game with slick mechanics do not download this. -Play in single player mode, start a server or join a server. LAN works but usually from the .exe directly rather than from the app inside Steam.",
