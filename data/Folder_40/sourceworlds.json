    "About the game": "SourceWorlds is a co-op action-adventure game that throws you into the strange world of the 'Architect'. Solve quests, loot items, defeat enemies, explore the world with your friends or sucker punch them in the PvP arena.. You are the average joe who just so happens to get sucked into an artificial world controlled by 'the Architect'. With the help of unexpected items and weapons it is up to you to find a way out of this madness and return to the real world. Slap opponents in the face with a stop sign, use magical explosions to yeet NPCs away from you, drive with ships over and knock out your friends in the PVP arena! Actually, you just wanted to spend a relaxing retro gaming session with your buddy and these old gaming consoles. Somehow, however, you seem to have a hell of a lot of bad luck and so you are transported into a world that is very unfamiliar to you (ever heard of Jumanji?). You will find the SourceWorlds are a strange place. Different ages, different cultures, all seem to be intertwined. The architect seems to be the all-encompassing power in this world. And you somehow got caught up in this and are desperately looking for a way out of these twisted worlds to finally get back home. In SourceWorlds , you kind of outgrow your old yourself! Find powerful melee weapons with which you can mow down your enemies in close combat. Swords, Daggers, Axes, Hammers, Stop Signs - everything your heart desires! Discover magical and inexplicable accessories that give you magical abilities. Become a White Mage, wield explosive magic, lift Thor's Hammer (if you're worthy) Control vehicles that inexplicably don't seem to follow any laws of physics. Like, really. Fun to steer Ships, Hovercars and rideable wolves! Collect unique masks, which give your character its very own flair! Play alone or co-op with up to four of your friends and have the greatest time! Play through awesome quests, let the story sink in! Explore a vast variety of settings like a medieval castle, a caribbean sea or a futuristic Sci-Fi world!
