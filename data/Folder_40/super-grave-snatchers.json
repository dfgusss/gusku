    "About the game": "Raise undead to protect yourself from angry villagers. Order them around and use pixelated spells to smash cottages, scare townsfolk, and generally cause a ruckus in the campaign or survival mode. Keep an eye out for randomized more powerful items cause you're just a poor little necromancer and every enemy is lethal. Why is everyone so angry? ..All you wanted were some new boney friends. Swap colors - you may be a corpse, but you still have style! Control large amounts of undead. Any enemy can be reused. Cast spells to support your skeleton crew or harm enemies directly. Collect and sell items to customize your loadout. Find secrets to unlock new spells, abilities, and summons.",
