    "Release date": "Dec 10, 2019",
    "About the game": "Suspicious Slide takes the 'ice slide' puzzle notably found in games such as Pokemon (Ice Cave) and Legend of Zelda (any Ice dungeon) and heavily expands the idea to be an amazing experience on it's own. That's just my opinion though, and I am biased, so why not give it a try and see if you agree? Enjoy: Over 40 levels with varying mechanics and puzzle styles Multiple solutions to most levels for more dynamic approaches Achievements to unlock by efficiently completing levels Level editor to create and share your own levels. Use Steam Remote Play Together to puzzle solve with friends, highly recommended! Please enjoy! :)",
