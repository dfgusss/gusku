    "About the game": "What could be more desirable than freedom if you dwell in a cage? Some are lucky enough to have Prince Charming to save them, but some have to take everything in their own hands — and then the Knight emerges, the Knight ready to fight the Horror. The Knight of the Crimson Tower is a kinetic visual novel about the adventures of Laura, a daughter of a noble lord and a host for a mysterious curse — or maybe a blessing? It is a story of how you make mistakes and fix them, about the hunters, the hunted, confrontations and revelations. What lies ahead: spoilt but kind-hearted lass to play as; a mix between horror and hentai; first glance at the mirror universe; quite a few hidden treasures; animated BGs and CGs; gallery, music room and the ability to swap in-game resolution for the best experience.",
