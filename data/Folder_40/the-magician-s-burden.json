    "About the game": "You are a magician living a fairly normal life in a small village outside of the Kingdom of Githrad. Deal with bullies, navigate your father’s temper and alcoholism, and work at your various jobs. As well as being a clerk at your parents’ general store, you can also choose between being a guard, a scribe, a farmer, or a thief. You get to have fun, too, like playing in chess tournaments, sparring, reading at the library, exploring necromancer’s caves, exploring the woods, and finding romance with the other villagers. The Magician's Burden is a 225,000 word interactive fantasy novel by Samuel Harrison Young, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Play as male, female, or non-binary; romance men, women, both, or no one at all Three different kinds of magic for you to choose from: stealth, light, or dark Dozens of stats detailing your skills, knowledge, attributes, relationships, and inventory Oh, yeah. You’re also hijacked by a demon named Zaleth.",
