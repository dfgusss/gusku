    "About the game": "The Odd Neon Void is an experimental Adventure/RPG game inspired by Atari 2600 and Commodore64 aesthetics. TONV brings elements from various videogame genres, such as action, adventure and RPG and combines with an original system of stats. In TONV, you become Jack, a character stuck in a strange and unfamiliar reality: the neon void, which consists in three distinct dungeons. The neon void is filled with creatures called bugs, which you may want to kill in order to both survive and increase your stats. Throughout the gameplay, you may discover a series of notes that can also increase your stats and clarify the plot. At the ending, depending on the choices you've made, you might expect different endings. *WARNING: This video game may potentially trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Player discretion is advised.",
