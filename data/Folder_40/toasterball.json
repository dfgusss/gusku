    "About the game": "A ball, two goals, and... toasters : Welcome to Toasterball . Toasterball is a multiplayer sport game (2-4 players), where you play as toasters. The game is based on physics, and packed with lots of random gameplay variants, explosions, and a bunch of toasts for you to burn! How do you play? Hold down one of the buttons on your toaster for a short time... release it, and that's it! Your toast flies through the air! The longer you hold the button, the higher your toast will go. Each ejection also makes you jump, allowing you to hop around the field in both directions. With only these two buttons, you can now move, jump and throw toasts everywhere. From there, any means are allowed to put the ball inside your opponent's goal! Athlete toasters You can already choose from one of the 15 different toasters present in the initial line-up of athletes. Each toaster has it's unique backstory, with four colors available and it's own locker. Random variants After each point, a new random gameplay variants is chosen. There are more than 20 different variants, including the ones you see in the screenshots of this page (ice rink, explosive ball, pong mode, etc.). All of these variants can be played with giant and small toasters, with or without toasts: like variants of variants (whoa dude).
