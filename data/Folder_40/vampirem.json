Raven, a vampirem of which two Sires have been recently destroyed by a Shadowhunter, is forced to hide in the shadows of the moonlight or burn due to a weakened imbalance coursing within his black veins, all while searching for a path to regain his power or seek revenge against the hunters who stole it.
