    "About the game": "Become a stealth driver in this short, minimalist game and try to sneak through the Volt Patrol security system! Drive undetected through a facility monitored by the Volt Patrol security system. Designed by artificial intelligence A.I.M.O.S, this system uses intensive vehicle patrolling to spot intruders. Find access codes and activate switches to open gates and defeat the Volt Patrol system. But beware, speeding through can be very risky! Key features Seamless stealth gameplay Handle the pressure as you evade patrolling vehicles Use your driving skills to face tireless and merciless patrols Use the environment to move undetected Use your observation skills to find a way out Drive and retry Volt Patrol is based on the essence of stealth: collecting information to sneak and reach the inaccessible. And its minimalist set of mechanics focuses on the feeling of infiltration. Good to know before you buy: If you prefer classic stealth games or racing titles, Volt Patrol may not be for you. There are no gadgets to help you through a complex scenario punctuated by numerous cutscenes. There are no high-speed racing cars like in classic racing games. In this game, it's just you in your vehicle trying to maneuver stealthily and evade the security system. Creative Purpose and Project Origin Volt Patrol was my submission for the Ludum Dare 41 gamejam. My intent was to mix two incompatible genres. At the end of the gamejam, I decided to pursue this unexpected but creative idea. :)",
