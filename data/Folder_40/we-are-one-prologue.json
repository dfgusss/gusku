    "About the game": "The We Are One Prologue allows you to experience a part of the final game before release. We Are One Prologue contains a selection of levels from the full game We Are One. The full game We Are One will additionally contain: A story mode, more content, levels, and mechanics. A level editor will be included in a later update of the full game. Love multiplayer but hate other people? We Are OnePrologue is a puzzle shooter where you work together with yourself. Every action you perform in a time loop is precisely replicated by a clone of you in the next loop. You have to cleverly plan ahead and cooperate with your clones across time loops to fight back against greasy machines. You play as a being of nature sent to defend the planet against machines that ruthlessly destroy the environment. Thankfully as a being of nature, you can travel back in time and create clones of yourself. Work together with these past and future versions of yourself to create an army of one and defeat the machines. Experience a variety of levels with new twists and challenges for you and your clones to overcome! If you want something done right do it yourself! We Are One Prologue was designed to be comfortable to play even if you are new to VR or sensitive to motion sickness. There is no artificial locomotion in the game and only teleportation is used. The game was made for both VR beginners and experienced users - It's easy to pick up, but challenging to master. Give it a shot!",
