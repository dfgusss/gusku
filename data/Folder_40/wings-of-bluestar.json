    "About the game": "Protect space against the last wave of an enemy that used to be mankind's ally: a mysterious intelligent artificial life form. Take control of enhanced trainee pilot Aya, or the mysterious veteran pilot Zarak and fight your way through waves of enemies in order to save mankind and to learn more about yourself and also about your enemy. Wings Of Bluestar is a horizontal hand painted and frame by frame animated HD game, no photobashing, 3D nor pre-rendered assets are used. Every asset is hand crafted and detailed by the same artist, which gives the game its visual integrity. Wings Of Bluestar is a shoot'em up game that takes the solid gameplay of horizontal arcade shmups and modernizes it for modern PC and consoles use. The game achieves this by adding a lot of features like HD graphics, trophies, a deep story mode that, under certain circumstances, offers dialog choices and therefore multiple endings, gamepads, keyboard and arcade stick support, a shop to unlock artworks, extra credits, sound test, extra game modes and more. Gameplay-wise, the player has access to two ships (characters), each with its own control, weapon upgrades and scoring system. They also vary in speed, protection and fire power, so each player can find their own style. Wings Of Bluestar is a hybrid between classic shoot'em ups and 'bullet hells' (Danmaku's), so everyone can have their fun. Despite the game being horizontal, it also has a lot of vertical scrolling as well, to add to the action. In addition the essential modes like Arcade, local multiplayer, boss rush and training, Wings Of Bluestar adds an extra story mode, for players who want to get more into the story. The Story Mode is played like short Visual Novel phases between stages. In those phases, the player will have to make dialog choices. And if some conditions are met, it can influence the story and lead to different endings. Single and local two players. Gamepad (Xbox 360, Xbox One, Dualshock 4), arcade stick and keyboard support, with a button mapping option. HD 2D hand painted visuals. Each ship has its own play style, weapon upgrade and scoring system. Hi-scoring system involves a risk vs reward approach. Huge bosses with varied attack patterns. 8 stages. A story mode in the style of a visual novel game that plays between stage/missions and, if certain conditions are met, offers dialog choices leading to different endings. In-game shop using in-game currency to unlock extra features. A gallery, featuring original artwork, concept art, and fanarts to unlock. A Boss Rush mode that lets you fight against bosses under a timer. Steam Trophies.",
