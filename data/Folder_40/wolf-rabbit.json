    "Release date": "Apr 4, 2018",
    "About the game": "It was on a hill covered by yellow flowers where they met for the first time. 'How about coming to my home?', said the rabbit in red, with a charming smile. 'You looks pretty hungry. My grandma will prepare you some good dishes.' The words hit the wolf boy's belly, making it started to murmur. 'Here! Carroll!', the rabbit girl was waving towards him, bouncing and vivacious. There is a house standing alone by the edge of the hill behind her. The wolf boy suddenly felt that there's something untold, seeing throughout the girl shining in a backlit. Carroll the Wolf Boy. He looks... reckless. Marcia the Rabbit Girl. She looks gentle and well-behaved. It is an adventure puzzle game with very few horrifying components. In the game you can explore the house as Carroll, solve some puzzles and try to find out what's going on behind the curtains. It will take you about 120 minutes to get all the 3 endings as well as some dead ends. By the way, I'm pretty sure it is a HEALING game. P.S. You may consider the Sealtail Studio as another name of LR Studio, if you like.",
