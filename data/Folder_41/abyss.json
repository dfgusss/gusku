    "About the game": "The earth is being invaded by foreign creatures, and you are the only one able to save the planet earth. Use the same technology as the invaders, against them, and work together with probably the world's dumbest scientists to save the entire planet. Receive the technology weapon from the scientists, and fight the invaders in a level-based, FPS (first-person shooter), 3D game, to protect the earth. But be careful, the invaders are pretty aggressive. In the level-based game mode, you can casually walk around on an invaded planet, earth. You can be unlucky and meet some invaders who will most likely destroy you, or you can take a nap in one of the buildings in the game. No pressure... It's only the entire planet depending on your fighting skills. May 1 2022 Update: New boss, unlimited levels, speedruns and much more.",
