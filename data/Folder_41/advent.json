    "About the game": "Havilah and Asharia are at war. It's not the first time and it probably won't be the last. But, what the people of these countries don't know is that these wars have already been foretold. The 4 ancient tablets left behind by the 'Creator' prophesy of other things as well but, no one knows what they say. Cyrus and his friends start on a journey to find that out. Their quest for the ancient tablets not only unlocks their hidden abilities but, gives them the knowledge of their continent's demise. What terrors await their continent? Can they prevent a bleak future by knowing what will happen ahead of time or is the will of the 'Creator' too strong to be over-ruled? If you like old-school snes-era jrpgs then this is the game for you. Features: 15 playable classes and sub-classes 400+ weapons, armors, and items 25+ hour game Several optional bosses and dungeons Save at any time from menu non-random encounters Controls/Tips: Z = Confirm/Accept/Talk/Open chest X = Cancel/Open Menu Up/down/left/right keys= Character movement Pressing X during battle also allows for the auto-battle and flee options to be selected. 'Shift' can be used to scan enemies. Equipment can also be changed during battles from the regular battle menu. In addition, Use ALT+ENTER to switch to full-screen and F12 to return to the title screen. Hopefully that answered some common control-related questions.",
