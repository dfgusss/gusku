    "About the game": "Aerofly FS 4 is a highly realistic Flight Simulator for beginner, intermediate and professional flight sim pilots. Explore the world of flying with a large fleet of highly detailed aircraft with fully animated and interactive 3D cockpits and custom coded systems. Fly with complex airliners, helicopters, business jets, fighter jets and warbirds, general aviation aircraft, aerobatic stuntplanes and gliders across the photorealistic landscape. Aerofly FS 4 is a true next generation flight simulator with an easy to use and intuitive user interface as well as custom graphics and physics engines using state of the art technology such as 64bit support, multi-core processing, native Vulkan and Virtual Reality (VR) support, a real time full multibody simulation and complex aerodynamics simulation. World wide coverage of elevation data and base aerial images are included with Aerofly FS 4. Step into the flight deck of your favorite airliner or enjoy a relaxing cross country flight in a warbird. Discover new places by flying one of the many custom missions or become a virtual airline pilot and choose from tens of thousands of real world airline flights. Track your career progress with the new flight-log feature or try to obtain all achievements in all aircraft categories. Aerofly FS 4 Features Realistic flight and ground physics Intuitive user interface with location map and graphical route editor Start the flight instantly in a cruise, takeoff or landing configuration; or on the ground ready for taxi or cold and dark Highly detailed and interactive 3D cockpits Time-Skip feature to jump ahead in the flight Instant replay Optional simulated copilot that can fly the aircraft autonomously Optional flight assistance features like automatic nav-tuning, automatic lights, caution/warning muting and other quality of life features Flight logs, statistics and achievements Flight mission presets and custom missions Global Air Traffic based on 10,000+ real world flights 1200+ custom modeled airports High resolution aerial images Scenery cultivation: 3D buildings, powerlines, wind-turbines, trees, etc. Custom modeled famous landmarks and bridges World wide elevation, aerial images and navigation data coverage Sloped and curved runways Adjustable time of day, visibility, wind, clouds, thermal activity and turbulence Real time ground illuminating from aircraft lights and apron flood lights Most common joysticks assigned out of the box and ready for your first flight Support for multiple joysticks, throttle units, rudder pedals and more Full Oculus Rift VR support and full Oculus Touch controller support HTC Vive VR support and full Vive Controller support TrackIR support Support for Saitek Multi Panel, Radio Panel, Switch Panel and Saitek TPM Aircraft Features Fully interactive 3D cockpits, fully VR hands compatible!
