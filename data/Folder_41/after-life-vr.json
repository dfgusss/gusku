    "About the game": "You regain consciousness in a closed room, how did you get there? Why is there a coffin? Are you dead? None of this matters now, all you can do is keep going. This game is a virtual reality experiment, about puzzles and ancient tombs, involving: - Contraptions - Traps - Treasures - Mysticism With your purchase you gain access to a room escape game with 2 rooms featuring 7 puzzles with a total of 42 keys. This is not a horror or suspense experience; there are no jump scare or time-is-running-out mechanics. Take all the time you need to solve the puzzles. This game supports room-scale VR. Works best when standing, but can be played seated as well. The controls include: - Trigger to grab and interact with objects. - Pad to teleport to location. - Grip to either take screenshots or change view modes depending on user preference. - Menu to open the game menu. Other settings (inside the game) are: - Show FPS. - Change screen scale to fit user’s hardware (bigger scale needs more resources but looks better). - Change language (so far English and Spanish have been implemented). - Reset the room. Other features: - Gameplay menu with objectives and a hint system. - Commentary menu with additional information about the game, the author, tools used and special thanks.",
