    "About the game": "I am an old man already. I live alone. Some time ago, my doctor told me that I have Alzheimer's disease. Apparently, it makes you forget things. ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————— You are having trouble remembering; things like what you ate for breakfast, where you put the car key, or who are the people shown in the photos on your desk. Still, those will prove to be only minor problems. After all, you live a very simple life during the day. It is the night time that is more difficult. In dreams, one has to make sense. Where are you? What are those things you see? Why does everything feel familiar, but also strange? Dreams are not simple. Dreams are complicated… Dreams are forgotten bits of your past clinging on to you. Dreams are the only treasure you’ll ever really possess. ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Alzheimer’s: Memories is a point-and-click adventure that tells the story of an old man diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease. In the game, you will re-experience moments of the life of the old man, and help him find out about his own past. Estimated play time 40-70 minutes.",
