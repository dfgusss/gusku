    "About the game": "Aztec Tower is a VR bow &amp; arrow game about defending the temple of your people against the spanish conquistadors trying to take apart your sacred site to enrich themselves on the gold which they're ready to and already killed for. You're the last man standing of a brave tribe who fought against the invaders for generations. They're about to overrun your temple, but you're determined to take as many of them with you as you can. The game can be played on the HTC Vive through SteamVR. It should also run on the Oculus Rift or other VR headsets, but is only tested on the HTC Vive. Also please keep in mind that this game is not historically accurate nor is it trying to be. Textures, models and sounds of other creators were used.
