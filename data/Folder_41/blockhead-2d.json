    "About the game": "Blockhead 2D is a love letter to old school platformers starring the Blockhead family: James, Jeb, Jack &amp; Jill, each with their own personality and special moves. Its intuitive controls and addictive gameplay were the result of 8-bit influences such as Mario Bros, Bubble Bobble, Joust and Balloon Fight. What separates Blockhead 2D from the rest of those classic but cute games of old is the violent and disgusting techniques these siblings use to stomp each other's heads in to win the bout. So check it out...It's easy to pick up and play, yet requires skill and timing to master. With local LAN and split-screen, it's sure to recapture the memories of sitting on the couch and playing competitively with friends and family. The demo is ONLY for training, getting used to the controls, etc. It is NOT an indicator of what the full version of Blockhead 2D is like. Also, as traditional with most multiplayer Steam games, Blockhead 2D will come with an online multiplayer, so you can experience the head-smashing fun from all over the world! *Online coming soon Comes with: A walljump! It can be used normally, or you can slide up walls with it! A unique cast of characters... ...and their own special moves! The big guys like James and Jeb have MEGAPOWERS! Check it out today for some old-school head-smashing action!",
