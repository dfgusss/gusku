    "About the game": "Colette, an apprentice to the beautiful alchemist Priscilla, lives a peaceful life with her master in the countryside. As an aspiring alchemist, Colette spends her days training rigorously, aiming to become as capable as her master. One day, however, Priscilla is suddenly visited by a stranger and departs on a journey for unexplained reasons. Before she leaves, Priscilla hands her workshop in the capital over to Colette and tells her to 'help everyone who needs you.' Now on her own for the first time in her life, Colette follows her master's instructions and begins helping people in need as part of her training to become a full-fledged alchemist. The path ahead will lead her on a most peculiar journey full of people from all walks of life, behind which lies a sinister figure who intends to seize the world for themselves... Using your workshop as a headquarters, take on requests to craft items the townspeople need and increase your atelier's renown! Learn different recipes and make everything from potions to accessories and weapons, climbing the ranks to synthesize mythic gear worthy of true heroes! Of course, some materials will require you to venture deep into wild forests, caves, or ruined castles, a task far too dangerous for a lone alchemist to take on all by herself. However, there are plenty of adventurers you can befriend who will be willing to tag along... For a price, naturally. In addition to weapons, Colette can craft clothes for herself and her party members, which can then be reinforced with different materials. Perhaps the hero of the kingdom could dress up as a ninja? Or the mage could don the outfit of a shrine maiden? You decide how to customize the members of your party! A Diverse Cast of Characters A haughty mage, an off-beat idol, a beastman looking for love, a hero learning her job, and many more! Adventures definitely won't be boring with this crew around! Refined RPG Experience With plenty of moves and spells to learn, the turn-based combat system's a breeze! You can distribute EXP from combat to your characters as you see fit! Join the Adventurer's Guild Rise up through the ranks of the guild while taking on quests to help the townsfolk and make the kingdom a safer place! In-Depth Crafting System Search for materials in a variety of dungeons to craft all the gear you'll need! Not only that, but you can further enhance your clothes with what you find!",
