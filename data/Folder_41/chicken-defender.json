    "About the game": "Chicken Defender is a low-poly 2.5D game which takes a slightly different approach from the classic tower defense concept. In each level you start with a certain amount of chicken which live their life peacefully in their coop. However, as you may know, foxes have chicken on top of their menu. Moreover, the fact that the coop is mysteriously placed in the middle of the forest every time doesn't help. Therefore, the farmer has hired you to take care of his precious birds. Your task is to save as many chicken as possible at the end of the day. Foxes are also smart animals, so they won't attack all alone; instead, they come in waves. But there's a catch: they won't come on a certain path, but rather from all directions, so you have to be prepared for attacks from all sides. Before each wave there is a building phase when you can prepare for what's coming next. You can choose between 5 items and 3 power-ups which might help you to achieve your goal. The items can be placed on the map and have different properties: Corn Turret: direct damage Super Water Hose: slow effect Missile Launcher: area damage Not-So-Smart-Catapult: critical damage Fence Power-ups can be bought and used only once per level: Fox Slower Coop Shield Turret Overclock After each wave you receive a certain amount of money depending on how well you did so you can purchase more stuff. At the moment there are 3 levels (easy, medium, hard) and a tutorial level. Being a 2-person team, it is quite difficult to build large-scale games on a very tight budget. Yet, should there be demand, we could add more things in the future. We're hoping you'll have a great time playing this game though and that you won't regret your purchase. Thank you and have a nice day!",
