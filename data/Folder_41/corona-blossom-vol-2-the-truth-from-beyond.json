    "About the game": "'Corona Blossom' is a visual novel.

Now, her cute characters will come to life, moving and expressing their emotions using the 'e-mote' system. STORY: R-ne: a cute, metallic lifeform who one day fell from space. Keiji Osaki: a young man with a hazy past, now working at a mech garage. After whiling away much of the summer together, the two of them make a promise: They're going to return R-ne to her home planet. Their plans are interrupted, though, by another couple of new arrivals to Hanma Town: the headstrong space pirates (or 'rare metal hunters') Lily and Yunie. Will Keiji and his friends ever be able to return R-ne to space? And what will become of the group's budding romances? The truth always emerges from the place you'd least expect...",
