    "About the game": "After an endless fall through powerful magnetic storms... you awaken. Your memory erased, you start exploring the world around you. Someone or something is pushing you higher and higher. Suddenly, you spot the most gigantic Tower emerging from the mists. You soon understand that to get the answers to your questions... you have to climb its summit. However, this is no easy feat. The Tower is protected by a high-tec h security system made up of complex mechanisms, fatal lasers, and robots constantly tracking your every move. If you are to survive, you'll need to use all your skills (jumping, double-jumping, dashing etc. ) and make good use of your SwitchGun, that can be used to enable or disable traps and robots in order to reach the top of the Tower and uncover the secrets of its origins. Key Features: Explore a mysterious world composed of immense and staggering levels with a labyrinth of secret passages to discover. Unlock new powers and upgrades in order to access new areas of the Tower. Challenge your friends and take them head on with our online leaderboards in Speedrun mode where every hundredth of a second counts! Reveal the secrets of the Tower by collecting fragments of memory from its former inhabitants as well as new levels and music for Speedrun mode.",
