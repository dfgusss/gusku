    "About the game": "'DEBUG' is a 2D platformer game that tells the story of Dr. Peace, who works at a robot medical center, and his assistant AI robot memory in the process of treating the trauma of the commissioned robot against the backdrop of 2111. Memory, which enters the memory code of the commissioned robot, breaks through trauma obstacles and terrain, solves puzzles to pave the way, and collects Dr. Peace's evaporated memory fragments from the giant robot created by the robot's vaccine program. From the calm dawn forest to the city where you can feel the rising emotions due to trauma, you can venture into places where the unconsciousness in the memory code guides you. ▶ Simple ways to jump and climb the wall. ▶ 2D platformer game that you can enjoy with a short play time. ▶ There are 5 stages. ▶ It's a storytelling where you infer from the pieces of memory you found. ▶ Puzzle that you can solve through your worries. ▶ It makes me think about the era of coexistence with robots and robot ethics. ▶ The last stage full of tension where you can check your control skills.",
