USP: Fast Paced gameplay Interactive exotic maps Wide range of weapons Convenient and intuitive controls Interactive elements on map - giant sand worm. The game is still under development and the progress of development can be followed through the road map. ROADMAP : Pure vehicular combat After the departure of the Twisted Metal franchise, a vacuum developed for the games in the genre of vehicular combat. Modern games are not pure representatives of this genre, they use some mechanics of the vehicular combat or presented as an additional game mode. 'Diesel Guns' was originally created as a classic vehicular combat and therefore the battle on cars here is maximally thought out. Special weapon Hellfire - is a rocket controlled by the player himself. Has a huge destructive power, can destroy many enemies at once. Control for battle In intense combat, classic racing physics only hinders the gameplay. 'Diesel Guns' offers the player arcade and quick control of the car. This allows the player to quickly master the control and concentrate completely on the combat itself. Hammer in action. Multiplayer in priority Also in vehicular combat games, the multiplayer part is not well implemented. In most cases, all the gameplay was originally designed for combat with bots and therefore the competitive part between live players is very poorly worked out. In 'Diesel Guns' multiplayer is the core of the game and great attention was paid to the balance and tactical diversity of game mechanics. Variety and speed Arsenal of weapons in games with elements of the vehicular combat is usually poor and all mechanics is reduced to a mutual shooting standing on one place. In 'Diesel Guns' in addition to a large and diverse weapons, each weapon has its own alternative fire mode, which must be applied from the current tactical situation and also the characteristics of weapons are tied to the speed of the car - the higher the speed, the more lethal the weapon becomes. All this creates a speedy and skill dependent gameplay with a lot of game mechanics.",
