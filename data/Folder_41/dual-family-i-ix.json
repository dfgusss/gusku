    "Release date": "Sep 16, 2019",
    "About the game": "THE STORY A wife and husband can no longer stand each other – for more reasons they care to claim for. With their past love crushed and household seemingly splitting at the seams, an exhausted wife seeks sexual validation. A faultless young woman begins her inevitable sexual awakening. Choose your role and witness two perspectives of one household falling to pieces, grasping for any possible signs of love in their descent. THE GAME Dual Family will repeatedly test you with a multitude of scenario-based choices that will influence the relationship with your friends, as well as the ending of the story arc. Do you just want a hug, something platonic? Or perhaps you desire something fiercer, more intimate; a kiss on the lips without hesitation. For those still unsatiated, you may find yourself wanting even more. Regardless what you seek in your relationships, there's much to explore in the story Dual Family offers. Troublemaker or stoicist, lover or friend; it's all in your hands. THE DEVELOPMENT The steam version includes the first 18 chapters (split between both campaigns) of Dual Family as a stand alone release; Part X, the finale for Act I will be released as a separate, stand alone installment (it's a big one) after it's already launched on my site. Many of the earlier installments in the story are far shorter than those found later, the most recent being the longest yet. The complete story (three acts!) will be added to steam as development continues, each act being released as its own game. For the sound/soundtrack, the steam build has only a handful of in-game sound effects and no music; original tracks as heard in the trailer will be included in future installments, but our priority has always been story first. Enjoy! :]",
