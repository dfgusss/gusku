Within the game, players can transform into whatever they want to. Sakuya chose to transform into a man.

A dazzling light appeared as soon as the game started, and before she realized it, the other participants disappeared. However, she wasn't alone. The redheaded man who should've disappeared as well stood before her. He initially seemed kind of strange, but ultimately they decided to move on together. Who is he?
