    "About the game": "Element is a realtime strategy space game for people who don't have time to play realtime strategy space games. Home no longer provides a means to survive. A fight for resources to escape our system has begun. The future lies beyond… Element is a visually stunning realtime strategy space game with a focus on sharp, accessible gameplay. Element is for lovers of beautifully crafted, original looking games. It is for people who are into space and strategy games but don't have hours of time to invest. It's also for gamers who enjoy launching missiles and blowing things up :) You are escaping a decaying solar system. You must visit each planet, mine enough element, and defeat the enemy to progress to the outer planets and beyond. Generate energy, mine element, build attack and defence units, and destroy the enemy while maintaining a balance between earth, air and water. Game Input. Element supports keyboard, mouse, keyboard and mouse, touch on supported platforms, and a game controller. Any method of input can be used at any time. Our preferred input method is a game controller with rumble support. Game controller support on Windows and macOS uses native input libraries and supports XInput devices where possible. Supported platforms also allow rumble and lighting for selected controllers (eg. PS4 or XBox One Controller), and the ability to connect game controllers at any time. Legacy input requires game controllers to be connected before the game launches. Game Speed. The game speed can be adjusted using the -/+ keys to super-slomo and accelerate time while playing. Use '0' to reset to normal speed. Pause in-game using the menu button on the right side of the screen, pressing 'P' or 'Escape' on the keyboard, or using the menu/option button on your game controller. The game view can be fully controlled while the game is paused. Screenshots. You can save a screenshot to your standard pictures folder using '.' on the keyboard. Use 'Shift+.' to take a high-resolution screenshot. In-game you can toggle free-camera mode using 'Shift+Alt+C' to fly around slowly, and use 'Shift+Alt+M' to toggle menu visibility. The free-camera mode can be used while playing or paused and is intended mainly for beauty shots rather than gameplay. Notes. The game requires a vertical resolution of at least 640px and our recommended minimum resolution is 720p. The game will happily render up to 4K/2160p. Linux support for Element is considered experimental but we are continuing to support it.",
