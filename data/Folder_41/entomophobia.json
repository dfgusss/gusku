    "About the game": "Kill thousands of Bugs in Entomophobia, a Roguelite Bullethell, explore the maps to find temporary upgrades for each run. Current graphics will likely be way different from the released version of the game, I just haven't spent much time on the art yet. MAPS: - The Fields - The Suburbs(Not In the Game Yet) - The Warehouse PERMANENT UPGRADES: - Speed (up to 25% increase) - Max Health (up to 50% increase) - Health Regen (up to .5 per sec) - Stamina Regen (up to 1 per sec) - Max Stamina (up to +125 stamina) CHARACTERS RON - starts with fly swatter - base speed and health DEBRA - starts with salt shotgun - faster with less health CLETUS - starts with bug zapper weapon - slower but tankier AGNES - starts with bug spray grenades - slowish and little higher base health Weapons -Fly Swatter -Lemon Disks -Bug Spray -Bug Zapper -Sythe -Newspaper -Arrows Guns -Revolver (currently the only gun) The plan for guns: Players start with the Revolver and will be able to buy other guns, as they are unlocked through play. And once bought will be able to be selected to use as your controllable weapon for that session of play. There is saving in this game, so you shouldn't have to worry about the loss of upgrades or shells(which are the currency to buy stuff). Also, please wishlist it helps out a lot. And note I've worked on the game as a solo developer for 6 weeks at the time the game is released into early access.",
