High impact cartoon graphics that zoom from space to a character's face KICKASS ANIME SOUNDTRACK by Giorgiost 'Fly Punch Boom! is pure hyperactive anime-style fighting madness fused with Looney Tunes exuberance, where two combatants take to the air to pummel each other into cartoony piles of pulp.[...] The goal isn’t just to win, but to have a blast being as over-the-top as possible while doing it.' -- Hardcore Gamer 'If you know anything about Dragon Ball Z, you're probably know it for the moments of mountain-shattering, world-cracking, energy-unleashing fighting. But beyond the actual licensed games, few games have attempted to capture the destruction and dynamic nature of those fights[...] Fly Punch Boom looks like it could change that.' -- IndieGamesPlus",
