    "About the game": "Forsaken Universe is a space-exploration-survival game based on a unique universe. Become one of the elite space explorers in the universe by completing missions, building a solid base, killing space pirates and aliens, or many other ways. The Universe After the black hole was discovered, it was only a matter of time before it reached the colonized planets. All planets were destroyed and became forsaken. Discover many unique planets around the universe that survived the black hole. Survival Survival has always been the goal of any civilization. Find food either by farming, exploring, trading, buying, or baking. Drink water to keep your motor functions running so you don't lock up. If you lock up, you die. The Cyborgs Once the planet became inhabitable, it was time for humans to transfer their consciousness into cyborgs. Slowly, each and all cyborgs started waking up after the black hole. They started expanding and creating their civilizations on other planets. Warning! Forsaken Universe contains flashing lights that may make it unsuitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions. Player discretion is advised!",
