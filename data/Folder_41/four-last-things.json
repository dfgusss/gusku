    "About the game": "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. God saw all that he had made, and it was good. Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being. 'Ooops,' said god, seeing he had created a fool. But before he was able to remedy his error, man spoke; 'No backsies!' he chirped, and scuttled off into the forest. About Four Last Things is a point-and-click adventure game made from Renaissance-era paintings and public domain recordings of classical music. It is about sin, and the Four Last Things – Death, Judgement, Heaven and Hell – and strives to be intelligent and ridiculous in equal measures. It's kind of like if Monkey Island had been made in 16th century Flanders, by a time-travelling Monty Python fanboy...
