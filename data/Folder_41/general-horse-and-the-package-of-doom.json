    "About the game": "General Horse is the last surviving military postman in the galaxy. After the great war with the Chaotics™, pretty much everyone else was dead. There was nothing left for him, but to take the highest position left in the military. On his journey to deliver the mail, he meets scavengers who try to steal his package. His duty, as a Postmaster General, is to protect what he considers to be sacred; and that is a package with an official post stamp. It needs to be delivered wherever it needs to be delivered! Join him on a dangerous voyage throughout his home solar system. He will fight, explore, barter, scavenge, and beg, just to deliver a package he knows nothing about! Be General Horse and deliver the Package of Doom! Features Full Motion Video - The whole game is played alongside high quality video sequences Resource management - You must survive your travels through hostile space by trading, stealing and using resources and special items. Try not to starve or crash into a planet. Replay value - There is enough scenes and choices to play more than once and still see something new. Highly intelligent humor - Only the smartest people will get the subtle jokes in this dark and mystical space drama. Method acting - Many of our high quality actors were never even given their scripts. They were carefully guided to become their characters and then we just let the script happen.",
