    "About the game": "Have you always dreamed of going on a gold hunt yourself? And to bring the valuable metal to light with small or large equipment and hard work? Then you now have the chance to show what you're made of and experience the different ways of finding and digging for gold with Gold Hunter. However, all beginnings are difficult. You start your adventure with some money and a metal detector. And when you have found your first gold, you expand your equipment with a small mobile unit. Over time, with more experience and with more gold, your mining operation grows and grows until, in time, you are mining the gold with the heaviest machinery and the biggest plant. And because the work in a mine never stops and there is always so much to do, you can now experience this adventure together with your friends. Manage your mining operation, hire and pay people to work for you, or assign free jobs that other players can take on and do for you.

You equip yourself with a metal detector and go - alone or with friends - in search of the first gold nuggets in the forest. The proceeds from this can be invested in a highbanker or a small mobile washing drum. The new equipment can then be put into operation on one of the beginner claims. The mining operation grows With perseverance and experience comes success - and with success the machines get bigger. And big machines need new space. Invest your money in a big claim and build up your plant there, using big excavators and other vehicles to keep the washing plant running. Hire friends in multiplayer to help you run your business to success. Your trademark Create your own company, configure your vehicles and your machines, build a house according to your wishes and furnish it so that the evenings can end comfortably with friends after hard work. New shores If you need a change of pace, how about digging for gold in the water with a dredger. Or how about digging for gold under the ice in winter. In Gold Hunter you will get to know and try out different ways of digging for gold. Stronger together Work together with friends on a claim to experience and celebrate success together. Or work with friends on a server in different companies and on different claims. Hire out equipment, place orders, or take orders yourself so that your expensive machines don't rust. There is a lot to do Gold Hunter puts a lot of emphasis on making the simulation of gold prospecting an experience. However, this also means that all activities and steps have to be carried out by yourself! Equipment has to be set up and adjusted. Levers and buttons have to be operated yourself, containers have to be filled manually, defective equipment has to be repaired and maintained. So when there is something to do, the player is challenged! Distraction And when you need a break, you can spend the time with various leisure activities, or explore the huge map and find places that are not in any travel guide.",
