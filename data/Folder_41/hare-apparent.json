    "About the game": "Hare Apparent is a dialogue-based roleplaying game in a high-stakes social elimination scenario. As one of five pretenders competing to rule the disparate kingdoms of Under-Sky, you’ll need all your social chops and strategic skills to be the last candidate standing and win the crown. During the day, talk with your fellow pretenders: build rapport, discuss issues, hatch plans and make false promises. Every night, votes are cast—and a pretender is eliminated. Last one standing wins the Ironwood Crown. Will it be you? • Randomized dialogue and relationships—no two playthroughs are the same. • 5 colorful and clever contenders to bond with or betray. • 6+ endings based on your cunning and conduct in the crucible of the Conclave. • Multiple difficulties to find that perfect balance between strategy and story.",
