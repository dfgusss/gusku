    "About the game": "Build and battle floating islands in the skies! Fly around the realms of a shattered world and interact with an assortment of islands and factions! Battle procedurally generated enemies, sometimes even more than one at a time! Build Build your powerful island from loads of blocks and attachments with the island editor. Place your blocks to form your base island, then load up on weapons, shields, reactors, batteries and so much more to try and give yourself the best advantage in combat. Assign weapons and modules to any keybind you desire, all configurable from the super easy to use editor. Fight As the saying goes, there's more than one way to blow up a floating island! Take out all their floatrons to make them fall out of the sky or destroy their warp core and watch their island explode in a fiery inferno! Explore Explore a vast realm, with factions, cities, and pirates! Find abandoned regions and grab some free loot, or a merchant with powerful items to sell! Encounter different enemy classes, with a variety of strengths and weaknesses! Every island is procedurally generated, so each encounter will be unique! Loot Collect items to maximize your island's potential! Forge items together to upgrade them from the bronze tier to the crystal tier! Every single item has the potential to be unique, and almost every property can be upgraded by tech. Infuse tech into items to give them cool buffs like damage penetration, increased health, or reduced cooldowns! With over 150 items, and with over 50 item properties and behaviors, the possibilities are endless!",
