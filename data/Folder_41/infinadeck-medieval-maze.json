    "About the game": "This virtual reality maze is a basic experience for the Infinadeck Omnidirectional Treadmill. It takes just under 2 minutes at max speed to get from the start to the end when using the treadmill- how fast can you make it through? Many objects are interactable within the space, and there are a couple of Easter eggs here and there. Designed for first time walkers, there are no jumpscares or things chasing you- the nuances of the experiences are up to you. Will you clear the maze as fast as possible? Or perhaps stroll through at your own pace? This maze was built using free assets from the Unity Store, including the SteamVR Unity Plugin, so it seemed right that this project be distributed for free as well.
