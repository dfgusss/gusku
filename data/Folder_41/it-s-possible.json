    "About the game": "Whether you're a player or creator, you'll get something out of [it's possible]. Bottle up your aggressions and frustrations to harness them in your tenacious will to finish the entire game, or chill in the level editor and create satanic abominations straight from hell that your friends are somehow supposed to complete. There is death around every corner. The only thing that isn't trying to kill you is the ground you stand on. Even then, level creators will probably find a way. Precariously jump over spike pits, dodge deadly lasers, and race against fast-moving sharp things to get to the end of each level. It doesn't matter how many times you die - just remember that every level is possible. With powerful tools at your disposal, the level editor is sure to bring out the engineer in you. Make your level dynamic with logic and events, make it feel alive by moving anything along a track, create a brand new minigame, or even manipulate the game camera. Featuring an intuitive and powerful editor which was used to create every playable level in the game, [it's possible] is sure to satisfy your need to create and your thirst for your friends' tears.",
