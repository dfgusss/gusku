    "About the game": "Kainga is an ancient village builder set in an unusual world full of surprises. Adaptation is key where weather events, massive beasts or other tribes can easily erase you from history. Every time you play, your village's culture, technology, and appearance will be unique depending on your environment, the resources available to you and the choices you make. Design specialized towns with every play-through, and unlock the secrets of the world! At the center of your town is your 'Thinker'. This slow, weak, leader guides your people, discovers new technology and must be protected at all costs! The Thinker can discover technology at sources of inspiration, scattered around the map. Develop your town enough to be able to complete the Thinker's challenge, then move on to a new one! Create Unusual Cultures Every playthrough will lead to new surprises and different ways to interact with the world. Your culture develops as you adjust to your surroundings, no two playthroughs will be alike. Discover Over 140 Unique Technologies Shelter, food, and resources are the basics, but learn to use some of the most unusual technologies in Kainga. Windmills that push away weather, cloud-popping balloons and jars filled with amnesia smoke are just some of the technologies you can learn to master. Train Units and Tame Beasts From giant acid breathing snails to massive leviathans bursting out of the ground, Kainga's creatures are all around you. Learn to live alongside these beasts or tame them, build on them and ride them into combat! Defend Your People Demands, raids and aquatic ambushes await in every game. Grow your forces and train your units to wield swords, spears, bows and rifles. Defend your Thinker at all costs and protect your workers from invasions. Acquire New Knowledge for Future Runs Death is permanent and a looming threat, but the lessons you learn, the technology you discover and achievements you accomplish will allow you to get further on your next adventure! Unlock New Biomes, Technologies and Thinkers Complete a series of challenges to progress through the star-signs, unlocking new ways to play the game, more content and an ever-increasing roster of available technologies. Kainga is being developed by myself, Erik, a solo developer. My ears are always open to your suggestions, ideas and comments. Join the Kainga community and share your thoughts and ideas!",
