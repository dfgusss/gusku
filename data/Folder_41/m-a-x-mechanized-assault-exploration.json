Mining stations, power plants, tactical combat vehicle factories, habitats – it's up to you to plan and construct them. The entire new colony? You create it. The resources you find there? Control them. Enemies? Crush 'em! And there will be enemies. You're not the only Mission Commander trying to colonize the planets.

It's espionage, heavy artillery, offensives, counter offensives and intelligence – all with maximum consequences. At its core, M.A.X. is about resource-gathering, building, and tactical combat.
