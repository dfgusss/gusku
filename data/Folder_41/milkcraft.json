    "About the game": "[Words to every sandbox game lover] 'The land of my dreams is not a track where everyone is running towards a single goal, the difference is only in the first and second place. My dream land is a wilderness where there is room for those who jump, run, pick flowers, wash their feet by the stream, and lie in the grass in the sun without doing anything.' This is the original intention of our development team to make Milkcraft, hoping to bring joy to the players and peace to ourselves through heartfelt game making. We added the essential building and exploration elements of a sandbox game to Milkcraft, and added rich and exciting RPG content as well. Here, there is no requirement to do anything; here, just the freedom to run around and find joy and satisfaction. Welcome to the Milkcraft family! From now on, we are a family. [Player Expectations and Game Features] -I expect an infinite map, moreover, I expect a splendid and colorful multi-dimensional parallel space *Please feel free to soar in the vast world with nearly 3000 square kilometers and 350+ heights. *Milkcraft currently has seven different worlds open to players: Lepitar, Overworld, Twilight Woods, Realm of Scorch, Realm of Chill, Realm of Mislay, and Midgard. -I expect to have endless companions to trespass together and unleash youth and fervor *Milkcraft is a completely open world, allowing all players to explore in the same space. A game server can accommodate up to 10,000 players, so bring your best friends. *We also have a powerful social chat system for you to enjoy more friend interaction and fun during your journey. -I expect to have a private place, just for me and my friends *For this reason, Milkcraft has a private territory system. In this exclusive territory, you are your own creator, and it is sacrosanct no matter how the world changes. *You can also build your own village with your friends, create your own home with your heart, and use it to witness your friendship, family, and even love! -I expect to be able to challenge the mysterious forces in the world and become a brave man! *The Grievous Warrior of the Mayan Temple, the Ghost Banshee of the Banshee Garden, the Anubis guarding the Pyramids, the Sphinx standing guard for the Sphinx, the Frost Witch waiting for a thousand years in the Frost Crystal Temple, and the Obsidian Guards standing faithfully in the Frostflame Volcano! *Are you excited to hear the names of these bosses? They are the natural guardians of every sacred domain in Milkcraft, so grab your sword, bring your friends, find and defeat them, and become a warrior in Milkcraft! [Our Design and Expectations] Milkcraft is purposely not designed with a perfect newbie guide function, we want every player to explore freely and discover the interesting places in the game. Therefore, the premise of the game will be difficult to experience, and we hope that each player can be patient through the initial period of discomfort. If you have any comments on the game or point out our shortcomings, please feel free to post a message to the Steam community. We sincerely hope that we can communicate with every player.",
