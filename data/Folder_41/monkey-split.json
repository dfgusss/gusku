    "About the game": "Welcome to our latest experiment called Monkey Split , a game being developed alongside our community on Discord and here on Steam. Thanks to everyone's comments, playtests, reports, suggestions, and ideas, we are slowly moulding this game into... something. What will be the end result? We aren't fully sure, but one thing is certain, it will be a game. And now it's time for a completely different description: You're now a monkey*, the room is full of stuff*, collect the stuff in the cardboard box while running away from the possessed monkey. EASY! Don't get caught! And if you're the one possessed, catch every monkey and explode them into the Bananaverse *. This game has*: - Procedural generated maps; - Lots of custom items for your monkey*; - 30% more potassium*; You should*: - Have fun*; - Ignore all the bugs*; - Don't take anything here too seriously*; You shouldn't: - Not report the bugs**; - Climb/Walk on the walls, you could get hurt***; - Spank the monkey****; Monkey Split features fast rounds, slow rounds, all the rounds and none of the rounds! ROUNDS!
