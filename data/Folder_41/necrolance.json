    "About the game": "The King of Nangarth is Missing! The Dark Necromancer has risen from the grave and has plans on taking over the land of Nangarth! The King of Nangarth has gone missing so it is up to you to find him and defeat the Dark Necromancer once and for all! Be warned young warrior, the necromancer is fierce and has sent his best servant, The Great Dark Warrior Thorg of Winstin, to do his bidding. Armed with your trusted lance and whatever weapons you may find, it is up to you to overcome all the fiends that Thorg and the necromancer put in your way. The fate of the world depends on you. Are you up to the challenge? Gameplay Necrolance is a single player, 2D platformer based off the style of a Gameboy Color game. In the game you play as both the protagonist and as the necromancer’s knight, Thorg. The protagonist’s campaign is more action based whereas Thorg’s campaign is slightly more puzzle based (only slightly). In the protagonist’s campaign, you are given a lance as your main weapon and can carry a secondary weapon. Secondary weapons are typically dropped by weapon wielding enemies that you defeat (either from mini-bosses or normal enemies). In addition to wielding different weapons, you can also buy upgrades throughout the game with currency that you collect through the levels.
