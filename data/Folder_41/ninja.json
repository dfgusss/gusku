    "About the game": "Granting you with absolute control 'Ninja?' puts you in the shoes of a parkouring robot as you hurdle through space to avoid objects and jump through gates to set new high scores. Using a variety of abilities such as dash, double jump, and sprint, it is up to you to make it as far as you can through a procedurally generated level in this endless runner style game. Go for the high score or take it slow and go for distance, the choice is yours. Play though a training course to perfect your skills or go for the distance in an endless procedurally generated level. Developer Message: On certain machines, the game will not run properly. This is a known issue and is currently being looked into. Thank you.",
