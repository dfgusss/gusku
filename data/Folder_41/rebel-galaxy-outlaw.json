    "About the game": "Out of cash, out of luck, out on the fringe. Juno Markev has a killer to tail, a debt to pay, and more trouble headed her way. Rebel Galaxy Outlaw takes place in a greasy, blue-collar world of outlaws, truckers, cops and thieves. Strap into a variety of spacecraft, settle a score in a filthy space-bar over a game of 8-ball, rock out to over 24 hours of music, and engage in white-knuckle dogfights. In the Dodge Sector it’s hard to get by – and even harder to get even. Rebel Galaxy Outlaw is an open-world space combat adventure game, spread across the nearly 40 systems of the Dodge Sector. Play as a mercenary, a trader, a pirate, or whatever mix of the three you feel fits you best. With an engaging storyline and a full conversation system, you can follow the narrative, or ignore it and forge your own path at any time. Engage in white-knuckle combat, and use the included Autopursuit function to effortlessly fly like an ace, instead of space-jousting for hours. Save up your credits, buy a new ship, kit it out, and then paint it in a fully-fledged 3d-painting application. Make a fortune exploiting lucrative trade routes. Join guilds, help or hunt those in distress, buy and outfit your own space station. Grab a tip in a local bar and hunt hidden treasure. In your down-time, shoot some 8-ball, play some dice-poker, or aim for the high-score in an arcade game in the local seedy watering hole. Flip through the 7 included radio stations and vast music library for just the right track to fit your current mood.",
