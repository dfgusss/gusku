    "About the game": "About Red Bash Help Reddy the Red Panda in this difficult, retro-styled precision platformer to collect all the delicious bamboo. The catch: you can use the enemies projectiles to your advantage. Redirect them to destroy obstacles or boost yourself to even greater heights. Master over 45 tight, handcrafted stages in multiple environments that offer different challenges. Features Tight 2D platformer controls and the ability to use projectiles to your advantage 45 handcrafted level with progressively higher difficulty 3 super difficult bonus level 3 worlds with completely different environments and obstacles 11 original music pieces Menus with detailed information about records and death counts Going fast There is a trick in this game that you can use to go fast like this. After using a Bash to get forward momentum, you can let go of all directional inputs to the side. This way you will keep all the Bash momentum as long as you don't hit a wall or touch the ground for too long. But don't worry, if this sounds too difficult, you can get through the game without ever doing this.",
