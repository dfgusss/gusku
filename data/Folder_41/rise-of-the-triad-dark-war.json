    "About the game": "Tackle incredible game hazards, such as spinblades, gun bunkers, huge boulders, Firejets, pits, Firechutes, Lavawalls, gas grates, and more. 'Like DOOM, Rise of the Triad is a high quality, fast scrolling first-person perspective 3D action game. Graphics are on par with DOOM. It has destructive enemies and lots of them, an arsenal of weapons from simple pistols to missile launchers, life-preserving armor, traps and ambushes galore, and the ability to play by modem or network. In all, there's a great degree of similarity between the two games. In addition, Rise of the Triad puts most of the other DOOM wannabes to shame - it's that good!' - Chuck Miller, Editor of interactive Entertainment Features Rise of the Real Estate : Super huge levels - up to one million sq. feet, and up to 16 stories high! Digital Diversity : Ten unique, digitized enemies in the game, plus four multi-stage bosses!

Collateral Damage : Nearly every object can be destroyed - even mark walls with bullet holes! Connect and Kill : Modem and network playable, up to 11 players via an IPX compatible network. Controller Support : Partial Xbox 360 Controller support.",
