    "About the game": "SIT DOWN, PLEASE aims to create a dark setting and a creepy/horror atmosphere while telling its story. It's a story driven game where a scientist, in order to achieve a goal for the sake of his kingdom, subjects the people of the recently defeated enemy faction to atrocious experiments. The more the agony will be prolonged, the faster the goal will be reached. Your main purpose is: with purely arcade gameplay you'll have to keep the guinea pigs alive as long as possible using the scientist's machinery. In this way the coveted objective will be reached more quickly and you'll fully know the story of each guinea pig and, at the end of all this, you'll be able to put all the pieces together to understand the origins and the story of this world. Will you be able to reach the end of this path? FEATURES: Rhythmic and arcade gameplay based on the use of the scientist's machinery. Story driven game that tells its story through horror. A successful atmosphere based on dark and creepy. MULTIPLE ENDINGS. Well characterized characters. SECRET RUN. The longer you resist, the more information you'll receive about the characters and the world setting. Original Soundtrack. Created entirely by one person.",
