    "About the game": "SPACEPLAN is an experimental piece of interaction based partly on a total misunderstanding of Stephen Hawking’s A Brief History of Time. Use manual clicks and the passage of time to create and launch potato-based devices and probes from your nondescript satellite orbiting a mysterious planet. Unlock the mysteries of the galaxy or just kill some time in what the astrophysics community is calling the ‘best narrative sci-fi clicker game of all times’. Features Fifteen starchy items to unlock, create, and blast into the vacuum of space. Life affirming, silly story that will both captivate and help you kill time. Reveal the secrets of five different planets across two different realities. Banging soundtrack, as is customary in a narrative sci-fi clicker game.",
