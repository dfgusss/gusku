    "About the game": "You play as Amelia, an adventurous mystic investigating the appearance of monsters on the mystical Square Island. Travel through a diverse landscape filled with monsters and treasures just waiting to be discovered. To everyone who loves the old zelda-style action games, here is a fun indie game made with a lot of love for 2D action games from the late 80s/early 90s. Made with RPG Maker VX Ace and Xiderwong Action Battle System, this homemade game was a labor of love that I worked on for almost 10 years. You play as Amelia, a member of a mystical order of shamans, sent on a mission to find out about the recent increase in monster activity, signaling the imminent release of the Demon King. Cast spells, wield weapons, talk to townsfolk with inane dialogue, and chase a cat through the swamp as you embark through eight dungeons with puzzles, monsters, and treasures galore.",
