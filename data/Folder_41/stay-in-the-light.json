    "About the game": "Stay in the Light is an immersive first person horror game with a combination of unique features: Real-time Ray Tracing and Random Dungeon generator. You are being hunted by Him, a creature lurking in a mysterious dungeon. With only a few items, a mirror, a torch and some chalk, you must survive this hellish place. There are treasures to be found, puzzles to solve and clues to uncover. Stay in the Light takes advantage of RTX rendering technology and can only be done in a real-time ray traced environment. The mirror reflects things behind you with pixel perfect accuracy. Light and shadows are key elements of gameplay. This game uses cutting edge rendering techniques to create completely new gameplay experiences as well as showing off the hardware capability of RTX cards. Dungeon levels are generated randomly for maximum replayability. The game includes the ability for you to generate your own random level and see the generation process in action, and then pick the level you want to play. Stay in the Light is free. There are no tricks to that, no in-game ads, no microtransactions. It's my way of saying thank you to the Steam community and ray tracing enthusiasts everywhere. If there is desire for it I will continue to grow the game and add new features. Enjoy and have fun! The latest drivers on a Windows 10 PC must be installed in order to play correctly. A ray tracing graphics card is required to see real-time reflections.",
