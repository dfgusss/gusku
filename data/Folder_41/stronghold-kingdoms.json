    "About the game": "Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses. Key Features 🏰BUILD Your Stronghold - Crush the invading hordes with impenetrable castle defenses. Then launch a counterattack! ⚔️BESIEGE Rival Lords - Attack sworn enemies without warning, cripple their economy or engage in political mind games. 🏹RESEARCH New Technology - Are you a farmer, trader, diplomat or warlord? Explore a vast tech tree to specialize and expand. ⚜️LEAD Your House - Join a faction, attack its enemies, return triumphant and rule over entire countries with your bannermen! 🌍PLAY Anywhere - Wage war with thousands of other Lords playing the full game together on PC and mobile. Besiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances. While an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility. Your vassals will look to you for leadership and you may find yourself fighting for the crown itself! Want more? Check out our latest Stronghold game, Stronghold: Warlords ! /",
