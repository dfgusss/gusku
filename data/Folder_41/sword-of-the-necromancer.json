Over the years and centuries many have tried to get that power for themselves, but all they found in the Necromancer’s crypt was their demise. They say that the tool the Necromancer created is also a weapon… The Sword of the Necromancer ” Tama is a former rogue that is tasked to escort the priestess Koko in her pilgrimage around the continent. During their travel Koko dies , and Tama carries the corpse to the Necromancer's crypt, where legends say there dwells a power that may resurrect the dead .
