Inside a futuristic war room, a 3D hologram shows two armies on the verge of battle. You are the tactical mastermind who must command your troops to victory. Build swarms of gunships, tanks, bombers, and other units, and use your hi-tech view of the battlefield to strategically outmaneuver the enemy! Tactera features 12 tactically unique unit types, as well as a procedural Campaign, customizable Skirmish missions, and head-to-head Multiplayer modes.
