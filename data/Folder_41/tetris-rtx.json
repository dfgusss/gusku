    "About the game": "TETRIS RTX is Tetris like you've never seen before - incredibly addictive with the best realistic graphics! Although the meaning of the game has not changed compared to what it was 30 years ago, the graphics are amazing! Now you don't need to represent black and white squares in 3D with objects from real life, the game will do it for you. In the game, pipes of various shapes will fall from above, which you have to rotate and move from side to side so that they fall and connect with the previous pipes. Also, so that the game does not end quickly, when you can collect a whole row without a single gap, it will be removed, so try to choose as accurately as possible where and which figure to put. Be careful, because the longer you play, the faster the pieces will fall and the less time you will have to think and act! What awaits you in the game: - Several detailed backgrounds in high quality graphics. - Nostalgia for the times when the gaming industry was in its infancy. - Musical accompaniment. Check if this is how you imagined the game before, get good emotions and just test your dexterity and quick wit!",
