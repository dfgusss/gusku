    "About the game": "• 7-10 hour story. Unlimited opportunity for exploration when the story is finished. • Explore over 400km² of stylised wilderness during this hardcore walking challenge. • Use your compass and map to navigate towards your objectives in 60 handcrafted story missions. • Find secrets and solve puzzles, as you discover the backstories and histories of 45 of the most unique residents of the Fairborne Mountains. • Delve into 45,000 words of original narrative, contained within 150 diaries, books, letters and journals. Piece the story together, to unravel a mystery that has lain dormant for fifteen years. • Trek through rolling hills and moorland, dense temperate forest, towering canyons, arid deserts, and long dormant volcanic mountains, all of which are beautifully lit by a dynamic day/night cycle. It’s fifteen long years since the last child was born in the mountains. One morning, a carrier pigeon arrives at Doc Hendersen’s farm with a message. The message comes from Communion Creek, an isolated settlement in the far north of the Fairborne Mountains. The news is amazing, a woman in Communion Creek is pregnant, and due to give birth. In order for the baby to have any chance of survival, Doc knows he has to inoculate the child as soon as it is born. Doc immediately sets out on the arduous trek, fully aware of the immeasurable value of the child. But rumours are hard to suppress in the mountains, and dark forces begin to close in…. Join your father in an adventure-based walking simulator set in a near future period, as humanity is experiencing the final stages of its pre-extinction decline. You'll be navigating and traversing punishing terrain, often in difficult weather, with only a compass and your wits to guide you, but all the struggles will be worth it, when you see what's over the next hill. 'The Quiet Apocalypse' uses landscape streaming to present over 400km² of stylised wilderness at solid framerates, and without the use of loading screens. Landscape streaming can cause occasional brief jitters in frame rates as data is loaded and unloaded. This is highly dependent on individual hardware configurations, so please bear this in mind if you feel that occasional interruptions to steady frame rate may hamper your enjoyment of the title. We always recommend that 'The Quiet Apocalypse' is run from SSD storage.",
