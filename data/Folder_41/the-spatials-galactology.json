    "About the game": "A new adventure for The Spatials! Five thousand years into the future humanity has made contact with other civilizations and has settled into new worlds. The Human Federation along with their friends the Crusantian Bunch are looking into expanding into a new area of the galaxy, and have elected you as their station manager. The Spatials is the name of your faction, and your mission is to build the most successful colony of the galaxy, at any cost. You will make friends and enemies along the way. Run your station as a well oiled production machine. Don't forget living quarters and providing all the vital products and facilities your staff needs. At some point you'll be so famous that visitors from all over the galaxy will want to stay in your station, for sweet filthy lucre. Build your space ships and explore other worlds to find valuable resources and purchase them from your friends. Or invade their planets and take them by force, it's your choice. But be prepared for the consequences... The Spatials: Galactology is The Spatials reimagined as a deeper, more rewarding simulation game.

About Weird and Wry Weird and Wry is a Barcelona game development studio founded in 2014 by two brothers: Carlos and Max Carrasco. Carlos (a programmer) and Max (an artist) share a love for simulation games and classic play -- which heavily influenced The Spatials , their first project. Inspired by the great classic sim games of the '90s, The Spatials combined classic base-building gameplay (based on isometric tile room building) with a real-time combat system and an exploration campaign. The Spatials was released on Steam in March 2015 and took off! Thanks to its success and growing fan base, The Spatials spawned a sequel -- The Spatials: Galactology , which updates the original concept with deeper gameplay and a whole new take on the space station management business.",
