    "About the game": "This game is a fighting game where martial artists fight in 1 vs 1 battles. Use a variety of techniques to defeat your enemies. You can guard against punches and kicks, but you cannot guard against throws. You can use commands to perform special moves. You win if you reduce your opponent's HP to zero first. You can switch between modes or difficulty on the chara &amp; stage selection screen. Clear all stages in the story &amp; arcade mode to reach the ending. On the menu screen, you can check your technique commands and return to the title screen. You can use the keyboard or PS4 or XBOX360 controller to control the game. Saving is done automatically. Japanese and English languages are supported, and can be switched on the title screen. Press F1 to go full screen.",
