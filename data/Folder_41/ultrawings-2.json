MOTION CONTROLS! Our ground-breaking motion control system is back and better than ever! Use your virtual hands to fully interact and control your aircraft. Don't forget to deploy your landing gear! IMPROVED AIRCRAFT PHYSICS! A realistic physics simulation governs each aircraft. Although the aircraft's flight model is based off of its RL counterpart, liberties have been taken to make them uniquely fun to fly. TONS OF GAMEPLAY! With several hundred hand-crafted missions you won't run out of things to do (for 40 - 60 hours). Here's some of the challenges you'll face while piloting your aircraft: Pop balloons with a dart pistol in the ultralight! Touch and Go in the helicopter! Perform aerobatics in the stunt plane! Spot Land in the rocket-powered glider! Destroy enemy drones in the fighter! HEART-POUNDING COMBAT! In a first for the series, combat missions (entirely optional!) will take your aerial skills to the next level!  Here's just a sampling of what awaits you: Engage in thrilling dogfights! Intercept enemy bombers! Annihilate enemy convoys (using a one-handed grenade pistol!) FEATURES 3X the gameplay of the original Ultrawings. New mission types become available as you progress through the game. Pilot 5 unique aircraft (including a helicopter!) using your virtual hands for an unparalleled, incredibly immersive experience!  Fully customizable HOTAS and gamepad support are coming in a future update. Cross-platform competitive dogfighting against Quest 2 players! Who will rule the skies? Explore all-new, hand-crafted islands.  Each island is about 3x larger than the ones in Ultrawings! The world is teeming with life! Buzz cars, boats, and other aircraft. Take to the skies during day, night, dusk, and in rainy conditions. Ultrawings 2 is designed and built for expansion. Expect new aircraft, new gameplay (air races anyone?) and more post-launch! Welcome back to Ultrawings, Pilot!",
