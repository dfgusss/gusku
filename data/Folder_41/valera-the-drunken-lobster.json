    "About the game": "This is a simple and relaxing 2D game where you can catch bottles walling from above. You are playing as a lobster (whose name is Valera) and you can get scores and bonuses for catching the bottles. To finish the game you need to collect all unique bottles! Key features Each bottle gives you something: a score or a bonus (there are negative bonuses too!) You can exchange your scores for power-ups You have time restrictions so hurry up! Oh, and we have the message from Valera himself! Hi! My name is Valera. I'm a lobster that lives deep in the ocean. I have a deep passion for drinking and searching for bottles all the time, but there are too many bottles to choose from! Can you help me find the best ones? Keep me drunk and don't make me feel upset! And be careful, I'm not sure that I'll be fine after drinking any of those bottles...",
