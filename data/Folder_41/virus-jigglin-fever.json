Similar to a bouncy ball, but with pharmaceutical goodness. 'This... thing?' a paddle that changes the ball of drugs to cure different types of viruses. You are the key member of a team of self-proclaimed virus killers formed to save the planet. Control the paddle thing and destroy the virus outbreak! FEATURING: Arcade-style game experience!
