    "About the game": "[Serious game introduction] Monitors named Family The game 'WatchFamily' is a mini game that satirizes the image of our ordinary young man who wants to take the time of his own by avoiding the eyes of the family who watches over and over. In the game, the hero's family appears briefly, and the player must read the situation and avoid the family's surveillance through the fast-paced ability, overcome the constant eye of the family and survive for a long time to get a high score This is the purpose of the game. Depending on the score, players are given rewards such as gold. With this reward, the player can obtain items that can be installed in the game, and the items provide special advantage to the player through installation in the game. The items appearing in the game were visually confusing and dreamy, with a paradoxical action on the Merengian symbol to symbolically express the individual being separated from others and falling into a completely independent world of fantasy.",
