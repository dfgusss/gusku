    "About the game": "Discover the dreams, fears and experiences of other people - and leave your own for others to find. In this award-winning social experience, sleeping creatures &amp; float toward you awakened by a gentle touch to reveal the voice messages of others who have previously visited. These unscripted and anonymous stories reveal and inspire, encouraging you to share your own for others to discover. Visually beautiful and wholly transformative, Where Thoughts Go: Prologue thematically explores the course of a lifetime through light, environmental design and five simple questions. The voice recordings you hear are unique and unidentifiable, left by individuals from every walk of life, every age and every background. Participants have no way to discern who they are hearing from, only how considerate and sensitive each and every person is. In a time of great division the experience shows how we much we have in common; we all dream, have hopes, and share human connection. Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
