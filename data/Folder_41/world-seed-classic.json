    "About the game": "No further development of classic As of 01/05/2022 this game is no longer developed and maintained. Previously World Seed Classic went under the name 'World Seed' but was rebranded to make room for the actual World Seed . This game exists mainly for nostalgic purposes and allows you, the player, to experience the early World Seed. As soon as the new World Seed is launched, we'll inform you about it here. This is expected to happen in February of 2022. Differences in features This list includes features that exists in the new World Seed and not this version. Hexagon world map (movement in 6 different directions rather than 4) Infinite worlds (you can travel &amp; progress your characters indefinitely) Visual &amp; mechanical combat improvements (you will now fight X versus X rather than only 1 versus 1) DFC- &amp; gearscore-levels (tier levels I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX &amp; X still exists - but has other use cases) Tier perks (each equipment can be customised to allow for your own playstyle) Form a party yourself (rather than playing only 1 character at a time you can play 4) More trophies, creatures, equipment, quests, dungeons &amp; locations to discover! Laid back gameplay World Seed Classic is heavily inspired by tabletop board games. Grab a few friends, sit back and relax! The core gameplay lets you move around on a world-board, clearing out tile after tile. Either for crafting materials, epic battles with creatures or just to simply explore the world. Every hour the world of World Seed Classic re-shapes with new content. In World Seed Classic you will: fight other players craft &amp; upgrade your gear complete quests for various rewards run dungeons with other players collect trophies level up by increasing your tier find and collect seeds to open up new worlds If you like MMOs, RPGs, roguelikes or simply character progression World Seed is probably for you! A dream come true World Seed Classic is my first game ever made. My vision is to provide a vast world with loot and challenges for you to overcome. As the sole developer of the game I've been working on it every day since its start, 26th of June 2019. My goal is to keep adding features to the game based on what the community would like to see.
