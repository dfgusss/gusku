    "About the game": "YOOKA AND LAYLEE RETURN FOR A 2.5D PLATFORMING ADVENTURE Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair is a brand-new 2.5D platformer from some of the key creative talent behind 'Donkey Kong Country'. With their arch-nemesis Capital B up to no good, the buddy duo needs to spring into action once again to save the day. To thwart his evil plan of using a “Hivemind” device to enslave an entire kingdom of bees, our heroes need to take the fight to Capital B’s “Impossible” Lair. Things look tough, but with the help of Queen Phoebee and her Royal Beetallion , Yooka and Laylee might just have a chance! 2.5D PLATFORMING! Each level offers beautiful, rich visuals with detail and depth. Yooka, Laylee and a whole host of colourful characters (good and bad) are realised in stunning 2.5D 3D OVERWORLD! The overworld isn’t just a hub to hop from level to level, it provides a whole separate gaming experience! Explore and unlock more 2D levels by completing objectives and puzzles, rescue the Royal Beetallion bees and find collectibles. ALTERNATE LEVEL STATES! Think you’ve got a level figured out? Try it in its alternate state! Flip switches in the overworld to create new landscapes. Hook up electricity, submerge them in water, freeze or literally flip them upside down for radically altered challenges! TONICS ARE BACK! Mix up your gameplay with the return of ‘Tonics’! There are more than 60 game-modifying Tonics in Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair including infinite rolling, harder enemies and super speed. They can also unlock new environmental and visual effects! BEE-AT THE IMPOSSIBLE LAIR! Players are free to tackle Capital B’s Impossible Lair at any time; however, they may find it too much of a challenge without the help of the Royal Beetallion. Free them by completing levels and they will add to your defences when taking on Capital B’s dastardly traps!",
