You can slaughter your way through many different maps, game modes and enemies - With tons of weapons and customization options! Cooperation Supports both local shared-screen coop (and split-screen if in pvp modes), online coop, and even the ability to mix both - bringing in multiple local players into online games! Support is available for global community-wide in-game-chat, local in-game-chat and voice chat to make cooperation and setting up matches even easier! Weapons &amp; Customization The game contains a constantly evolving stable of items to find in-game and add to your inventory! Giving you options to change each of your characters individual look and load-out. There are even some rare special-drops of steam-inventory items that have rare randomized stats for you to bring into your game! This stable of items includes many fun and exotic weapons - everything from automated turrets to rocket-propelled-chainsaws! Skills The longer you play the game, the more experience your character gains, and the more times you level up! Leveling up allows you to unlock parts of the skill tree that give you passive or active skills you can activate during games to give you an edge over the enemy! Game Modes Many different modes are implemented, with more being worked on! For PVE this includes modes like: like wave-based game modes and objective modes. While PVP provides the common deathmatch style modes, CTF, TDM, DM, Gun-Game, etc. If that's not enough we provide several rogue-like game modes that procedurally generate their game maps! Providing more longevity to the game! Various game modes also provide global ranking to show how awesome you are at the game! Level-Editor &amp; Workshop If that's not enough, the game also features a level editor that has full support for Steam Workshop. If the provided maps aren't enough, you can make your own or browse ones other people have made! In future we want to work on opening up the source of some of the gameplay code to allow far-larger scope modifications!",
