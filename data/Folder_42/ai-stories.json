    "About the game": "This game has a lot of chaotic and bright colors and flickering textures. It is probably not fitted for people that suffer from Epilepsy. But In the Settings, there are a lot of sliders and switches to activate or deactivate the effects or make the game less saturated or bright or more. This way, the Player can make the game more comfortable to them. Befriend the AIs, find their messages, and understand their problems. Explore the surreal and confusing yet beautiful realities, split up in multiple sub realities. Listen to the Music, created with virtual and real instruments. A colorful and surreal adventure to have, exploring all finished realities housed by the different AIs that are eager to tell you their stories and take you on an amazing trip! There is a 'Color Change' setting fitting to the mushroom reality. There is currently one chapter filled with mushrooms and one AI, but with every major update there will be more chapters with more of them. The Controls are in 2D, it plays like a 2D Walking simulator, more about experiencing the stories, collecting messages and having a cool time in the strange realities rather than fast gameplay. AI Stories, a small game in constant development, made by Emir Akyazi.",
