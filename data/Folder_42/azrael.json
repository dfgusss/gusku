Play as Azrael, a detective with occult powers which allows him to relive the crime scenes to solve a criminal case in a group of friends. Explore, find clues and try to investigate who is the serial murderer of the case. INTERROGATE SUSPECTS In the scenes of each crime, you'll find clues that are used to interrogate suspects to see their reactions and build an opinion. Once again, you are the leader of this case and you have the responsibility to find the right suspect. EXPLORE ENVIRONMENTS Explore different scary environments and solve some puzzles to find relevant clues in scenes, but don't stay too long in the world of the dead or your sanity will drop down! CHECK YOUR PROGRESSION Use the board in your office to recheck what you found and build your own interpretation of the case, it also allows you to prepare before going to interview a suspect.",
