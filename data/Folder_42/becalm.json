    "About the game": "In this relaxing first person voyage you'll sail towards the sunset through magical waters in a very special boat. You won't have to worry about steering, logistics, missing crewmembers, capsizing or even pirates. It's a trip for you to sit back and... becalm! Bright and dreamy watercolor aesthetics that bring to life multiple biomes. An awesome synthesizer ensemble cascading through field recorded maritime soundscapes. Every time you play it'll randomly select a journey for you. Choose between a five minute journey or endless mode. Relax. Use your mouse to look around. Space to switch journey. Press Esc to Quit, tho it closes on its own after 5 minutes. Music, Art and Programming by @colorfiction Special thanks to Eric Lorenz for field recording many of the ocean and boat soundscapes!",
