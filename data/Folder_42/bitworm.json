    "About the game": "Collect bits to grow your worm — but don't bite your tail! Outwit (and out-eat) an army of hungry ants and fast-moving centipedes in this challenging, 8-bit quarter game. Bitworm is a throwback to classic arcade games of yesteryear, complete with retro graphics and 8-bit sound tones. In this alteration of the classic Snake game, you work to grow your worm by obtaining bits while avoiding running into ants. Work quickly to eliminate all of the ants in each stage to progress to the next stage. If an ant eats a bit, it may spawn a new ant! If you take too long to clear a stage, more ants will spawn! The longer you grow your worm's tail, the easier it will be to trick ants into hitting you, but don't bite your tail! Biting your own tail will spawn a centipede! Centipedes move as fast as you do, and can grow up to 50 segments long! They are also smart enough to avoid running into your worm! If the current game is too difficult for you, you can type ' EXTRALIFE ' on the main menu to start the next game with an extra life. Entering ' TOOEASY ' on the main menu will unlock an extra hard difficulty mode!",
