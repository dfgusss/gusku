    "About the game": "Blood Spear is a student game which won the first prize of the jury at ISART Digital Montréal in 2021. Featuring action ranged gameplay, you play as the Blood Spear, a cursed weapon with demonic powers who is able to possess the body of dead ghosts. This grants you many abilities, like a powerful throw, a way to cheat death, and the power to absorb the blood of your enemies in order to heal yourself. There is much more to discover as you progress through epic environments and engage in bloodshed during clashes against powerful foes. IMPALE YOUR ENEMIES The core mechanic involves aiming your spear at enemies and impaling them against the environment. Throw with precision, use your demonic powers to charge your spears, shatter planted spears to release even more power, and nourish from the blood of dead enemies to heal. EXPLORE EPIC ENVIRONMENTS What you seek resides within a forgotten shrine above the clouds. Progress through grandiose environments in a medieval dark fantasy atmosphere and explore a world plagued by corruption. FIGHT AGAINST THE CORRUPTION A strange cult inhabits the sanctuary and carries out occult rituals. They seem to be controlled by a superior entity and feed off the corruption of the place. Whatever their goals are, they don't want to be disturbed.",
