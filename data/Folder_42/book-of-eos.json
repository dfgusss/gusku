    "About the game": "On January 1st, I challenged myself to design, develop, and publish a complete game in 1 month. This is that game. The original idea was to tell a somewhat cliche RPG story with one critical change: You play as the monsters. Ozymandias is an imp living in the valley near Detritiville. He's a scavenger; searching caves and battlefields for loot and equipment that he can sell and buy supplies, but when he finds an old book with a powerful aura, he is drawn into a quest that spans the continent to uncover the mystery of the book's origins. I know it's nothing spectacular and it uses mostly premade assets, but hopefully it makes up for that with solid map design and writing. Thank you for coming on this journey with me. Features: Approx. 8-10 hours of dungeon-crawling adventure. Fun and creative story with deep lore and interesting characters. No lootboxes. No pay-to-win BS. 3 different endings. Controls quick guide: Z, Space, Enter - Confirm , select actions, talk to people, interact with objects X, Esc - Cancel commands , back out of options, open the menu Q/W - Quick switch through characters on equip/status screen Shift - makes the character dash, except on the overworld map Arrow Keys - Move Alt+Enter - Full Screen",
