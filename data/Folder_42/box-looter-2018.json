Climb the mountain and find the loot box of unknown riches that the prophecy foretold! The 2,018th game in the wildly popular Box Looter series. Box Looter is my attempt at making a fun little satirical game. I am experimenting with making smaller games in a short amount of time. This is the first game in that experiment. Let me know what you think in the Steam forums! Note: Box Looter 2018 is a one-time purchase. There are no micro-transactions in the game.
