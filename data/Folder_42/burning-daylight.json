    "About the game": "Waking up naked in a grotesque slaughterhouse, you have no recollection of who you are or where you come from. Your only clue is a mysterious tattoo on your chest. You must now escape and travel through a dystopian society in order to uncover the mysteries of your origin. The story is set in the future where life cannot sustain outside, what remains of human society, now lives in megastructures waiting for the day, when they once again can live outside. You will explore the world inside of the megastructure, from the low-level slums to the bustling city streets, while exploring its society; you will learn that not everything is how it seems. Burning Daylight is a sci-fi adventure game, set in a dystopian future with light puzzle elements and environmental storytelling. Made by a team of 12 students from The Animation Workshop.",
