    "About the game": "THE OLD WEST, 1864. In order to save their family, the McCall brothers will kill anyone who stands between them and the legendary Gold of Juarez. But when the allure of money and women tests their bond, will the blood they share prove to be thicker than water? Become a Gunslinger — Harness an array of weapons, from various revolvers to heavy-caliber cannons and machine guns. Every accurate shot increases your concentration, which allows you to unleash deadly shooting modes when outnumbered — and even deadlier ones when the brothers work together. Brothers in Arms — Choose to embody Ray or Thomas, each with a distinctive gameplay style (close- or long-range), specific abilities (lasso, dynamite, etc.) and arsenal of deadly weapons (dual guns, long-range carbine, etc.). Take advantage of their strengths and you just might survive some of the fiercest fights imaginable. Immersive Western Experience — Explore vast natural landscapes of the untamed mythical Old West on foot, horseback, in wagons and canoes. Visit iconic settings full of outlaws. The McCall brothers face a renegade Apache chief, a greedy Mexican bandit, a vindictive colonel — and those are just a few of the underhanded villains standing in the brothers’ way. Please note that as of August 2016, the online features for this game are no longer supported. The Multiplayer mode / Co-op mode will no longer be accessible.",
