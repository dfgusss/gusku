    "About the game": "A new adventure game based on a real life story! Get your knife, put on rags and go down the basement! 📱 Simple controls Walk with arrows. You can throw a knife at the enemy. Now you are ready to play! 😱 Exciting situations every play Unique levels are intertwined with completely random ones 👺 Unusual enemies No orcs and elves! There are angry homeless people, crazy karates, maniacs, zombies and many others! 'Finally I can take a chainsaw and remove the accumulated irritation of the day' - Ash W. 📖 Storyline There are not only dungeons, but also quest levels where you can drink a beer and break up with a girl 🎸 Unique soundtrack Analog synthesizer and electric guitar set their own atmosphere 👴 Traditional roguelike century-old graphics You and enemies are displayed in ASCII characters. This is how our great-grandfathers played classic roguelike games! ☕ Compact game without a billion levels of the same type Are you tired of starting the game with the idea that you can hardly pass it? 'Cellar' is not stretched for 1000 hours of play - it is possible to win even in half an hour! ♟ Not chess, but... It may look simple, but there is a lot of room for tactics",
