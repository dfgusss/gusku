    "Name": "Cloud Gardens",
    "Release date": "Sep 1, 2021",
    "About the game": "Harness the power of nature to overgrow lo-fi scenes of urban decay and manufactured landscapes. Create small plant-covered dioramas of brutalism and beauty by planting seeds, repurposing hundreds of discarded objects and creating unique structures for nature to reclaim. Dive into a relaxing sandbox mode with no goals, or take on a multi-chapter “campaign” where the task is to strike a balance between the natural and the manufactured. Adding objects will encourage lush vegetation to grow, but each object must be covered in foliage in order to proceed. Cloud Gardens hovers somewhere in between a sandbox toy and a game with challenges. Partly a gardening simulator, partly a dystopian landscape builder, and partly a puzzle game that is both satisfying and without frustration. It is a relaxing experience that takes you from one scene to the next while encouraging creativity and coming up with your own solutions. This is a chill game where the primary goal is to delight in your own creativity. Players can download looping videos of their completed dioramas and share them with other gardeners from across the internet, and our Discord server has a lively community of gardeners. Solve organic puzzles in a serene 3D space. Create to your heart’s content in creative mode. Unlock an enormous catalogue of objects and plantlife. Share your creations. Featuring generative soundscapes by Amos Roddy, composer of Kingdom.",
