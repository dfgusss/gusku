Blow up foes with ammo ranging from micro rockets to high-explosive flechettes. Disable enemy security systems and program their robots to do your bidding. Customize Your Freelancer: Build your own destiny. Your character is a blank slate with customizable traits to fit your playstyle. Want to be stealthy? Or go in guns blazing? It’s up to you, and you can choose a new mix of traits with each new game. Shop the black market to install and unlock up to 50 unique upgrades. Dynamic Gameplay: Procedurally generated levels offer new challenges and opportunities with every play. A different run every time means limitless replayability.",
