    "About the game": "Game synopsis To end the life of a platform worker - No matter how long it's been, it's not easy. You arrived at Colony, the other side of the universe, to make money in a short time. Coral Drive, the company that runs this place, offered an unfair contract. This is already the other side of the universe. Earth's laws do not work. You survive here and complete the settlement safely. Torto signed a contract with the aim of escaping Colony and Earth. Characteristics of the game. This game is 'SF Factory Labor Simulation.' You start manufacturing ships hundreds of light-years away from Earth at the Tortuga Colony. 1. Free puzzle with no answer Build a ship using block-parts that rush quickly along the rail. But there's no correct answer here! I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a high reward by filling the ship with parts. Or it's your choice to fill the ship with blocks in moderation and increase the number of orders. 2. Upgraded system to help with work Coral Drive supports your 'self-improvement'! When you get tired of working in the factory, go outside the colony and collect ingredients. Upgrade your 'production machine' using the ingredients you collected! It allows you to spend your day more efficiently more efficiently. 3. Interaction with characters But I can't live alone for 12 weeks! There are various people in this colony to assist you in your work. If you talk to them and help them, they will help you!",
