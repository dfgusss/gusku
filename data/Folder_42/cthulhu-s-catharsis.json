    "About the game": "You are Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, or Yog-Sothoth. And now the Great Ones that You didn't pick are going to try to kill You. But You, Greatest One, will destroy them first. In Cthulhu's Catharsis: a Lovecraftian Turn-Based Strategy God-game. A Risk-inspired strategy game without the randomness. Card game style combat, without the cards. A 4X empire-building strategy game set in the Cthulhu mythos. Play as one of four eldritch horrors: Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, or Yog-Sothoth. Mutate Your units with special powers in order to gain a tactical edge on the other Gods. Take out your paintbrush and unleash Cthulhu van Gogh--You have the ability to draw Your own lands out of nothing. Explode nations through Your sheer, raw Power. They do not return. Force shoggoth slaves to build horrible structures and even more horrible units. Explore a research tree that unlocks new eldritch abilities. And the best part, You progress through the research tree by sacrificing Your poor, dirty humans. Unleash powerful magick through the Focus tree, which changes dynamically based on Your chosen deity. Because of all the horrible screaming You cause, elder monstrosities like Father Dagon and Mother Hydra will awake and invade this world. Appease them, and they can do great, terrible things. Anger them, and their wrath will be sizable, but puny. Play singleplayer and test Your wits against the nefarious AI! Or, play online with up to 4 of Your friends and enemies!",
