    "About the game": "CUBE-e 2 - 2D shooter about robots for one and two players, made in stylish hand-drawn graphics. Background: After the crash of the 'Junior-1' station, our hero finds himself on the distant planet Mallar, but the pursuit of his mechanical soul does not stop. Hunters are sent after him from the station 'Junior-1', whose purpose is to destroy the perpetrator of the crash. You have to fire at them, fight back in every possible way, trying to hold out as long as possible. Hide and shoot without falling into the saw-shaped traps, while picking up boosters that will help you survive the next wave. How long can you hold out under fire from enemy robots? You can also measure your skills with your friend by starting a real war on the same computer. You have to run around the map and shoot at each other, jump on platforms to hide from enemy fire and try not to hit the saws, which are deadly, until the counter of one of you shows the number 5. Find out which of you is stronger and quirkier on an alien scale.",
