    "About the game": "You can enjoy tennis with a natural swing, with the controller as a racket. Especially for experienced tennis you can enjoy a very realistic feeling of operation. You can set details such as the height of the player, the height of the hit point, grip, etc., and you can play with your own style. By nurturing computer characters, you can nurture strong players. Since the character learns by artificial intelligence, you should become an excellent trainer and grow characters. Besides network fighting, we have a watching mode that allows nearby players to watch the battle situation. Not only the person wearing VR goggles but also the people around can share fun.",
