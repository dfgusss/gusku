    "About the game": "Dap: Prologue is designed as a short introduction to the eerie world of Dap, the upcoming horror-action-adventure releasing Q3 2021. Approximately 15mn long, it is a first taste to the main mechanics, the atmosphere, and the terrible horrors that lurk in the shadows of the canopy... In Dap, you must guide a group of tiny ‘Daps’ through a hostile and corrupted world. Something has descended onto the forest - something incomprehensible, sinister, slithering in from a crack in reality. It’s up to you to get everybody home. Explore a lushly atmospheric pixelated world, guiding your Daps through a permeable realm on the border between dreaming and waking. Encounter otherworldly horrors, inter dimensional entities, and gods that have no business being worshipped. Band together to solve puzzles and fight off hellish threats. The more Daps you gather, the stronger the pack will become, but beware: Daps are not immune to infection. Linger too long in the wrong place and the pack will turn on itself, with horrific consequences. Ascend to the spirit world and tend your garden there, taking a much needed break between levels. Meanwhile down on the ground, you’ll need to scavenge and craft in order to survive. Use every resource available to survive an existential ordeal.",
