Having binge watched broadcasts of Earth TV the aliens are convinced that advertising is the most important part of any sporting event. Sponsors will randomly take control of events and twist them to fit their agenda, leading to a chaotic galactic summer games like no other. Play together with friends Run, jump, throw and compete in crazy contests with up to 20 local players in Party Mode or take on the single player Challenge Mode and climb the global leaderboards in a variety of challenges.
