    "Release date": "May 26, 2016",
    "About the game": "A vibrant, futuristic, 'twin-stick' style shooter, for 1-4 players. It's 2147 and the human colony on Europa has suffered a terrible fate. Rebooting after hibernation, two super-intelligent AI cores awake to find themselves installed within a couple of old security drones. Their attempts to uncover what occurred may end up becoming a lower priority than merely surviving... Lots of robots, lots of lasers, lots of aliens, lots of explosions! The numerous retro arcade influences are front and center, but spiced up with a colorful modern style, a generous helping of sci-fi intrigue, and a dash of RPG ELEMENTS! Don't fight alone! Up to 4 players can battle together in local co-op, but you'll always have your trusty (AI-controlled) robo-buddies by your side. Story mode sees you battle through a ton of handcrafted levels as you attempt to shed light on the calamity that befell the colony. Arcade mode is a straight up arena-shooter, where you battle wave after endless wave of the alien horde. Versus mode pits you against up to 3 friends (or AI controlled bots - If your friends are wasting their time doing something other than playing Dual Core). A gamepad is recommended, but full mouse &amp; keyboard controls (customisable) are available.",
