    "About the game": "Erusal is a reading-heavy horror adventure game. It is best experienced in a dark room, alone, while wearing headphones. Abandoned by your friends, you leave for the day to tear up a new part of the mountains on your quad bike. It feels good to be outdoors. The wind whipping past makes you feel alive. You weave between the sparse trees. Then, a harsh pain across your chest. There was a cable tied between those last two trees! The bike keeps going, but you are stopped mid-air. Then you fall into darkness. You wake up dazed. There is a woman outside digging...but digging what? It doesn't feel right. You have to get out of here! Discover the secrets of the town of Erusal, escape a horrible maniac, and get spooked by this epistolary horror.",
