    "About the game": "Etheldia Pepper is a monster taming RPG inspired by titles such as Pokemon and Final Fantasy. Colthan the Rabbit wants to marry the girl of his dreams, but to do so he must first become a knight. In order to attain knighthood, Colthan must defeat elders from each of six rabbit tribes. Along his journey Colthan will traverse deserts, mountains, rivers, beaches, snowlands and even take to the skies. Colthan can recruit friends he meets along his way to aid him in his quest, and with a little help from the magician Caraway he can even fuse with elemental slimes to attain new powers. Meanwhile, back in the town, conspiracy is rife. Can Colthan solve the mystery and become a knight to fulfill his dreams? With sixty species of characters to recruit and open ended progression letting you choose which elder to fight and when, Etheldia is a short and sweet game with almost infinite replayability.",
