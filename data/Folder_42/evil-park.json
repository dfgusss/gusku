    "About the game": "Evil Park is an atmospheric horror game, based on simulating obscure situations of distress, insecurity and anxiety. The narrative is presented in a conceptual way, and it is up to each player to interpret the events individually. There is no default protagonist. You will be in control of yourself (first person), being represented by the game. The dirty and blurry look is inspired by snuff movies and low budget classics. The gameplay follows a simple and objective line, being based on exploration, collection of items (randomized) and survival. Your enemies will be murderous hunters of humans, masked lunatics, thirsty for violence, who will do everything they can to make sure you don't escape. EP is an audiovisual focus experience, an obscure stroll in the heart of a dark, isolated and mysterious region.",
