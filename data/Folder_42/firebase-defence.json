    "About the game": "Build your Firebase Defend it at all costs Get home alive (Optional) Firebase Defence is a new spin on the traditional tower defence gameplay. You have to defend yourself from the waves upon waves of incoming enemies. You are free to build, place and manage your available resources and units in any way you want. But failing to balance those will result in defeat! Key Features: Construction! - You choose how your Firebase should look and function. Different units with very different play styles - Using the right combination of your units is the key to a successful defence. Manage ammunition - Different units uses different ammunition, you need to make sure they never run out. A wide variety of different enemies - From small and almost harmless, to huge and dangerous that will level your Firebase to the ground if not dealt with. Mission variety - Different missions require different strategies. Survival mode - Unlockable extra mode that gets progressively more difficult. Bonus Feature: Blow up sheep! (not to be confused with inflatable sheep)",
