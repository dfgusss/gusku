    "About the game": "Fishery is a creative aquarium simulation and management game. Species Almost all the fish and plants that are in the game are created to imitate their real life counterparts. The art style of the game is very stylistic but we aim to make every species recognizable to people familiar with the hobby. Dimorphism Quite often male and female fish of particular species have differences in their body shape and colour patterns. It is important to us that we show this in game even when the differences between male and female are very subtle. Creativity Every aquarium can tell a story. Create dramatic rocky landscapes, thick aquatic jungle or even a scene showing the rusting carcass of a sunken machine. It's up to you to create the unique world that your fish inhabit. Lighting Create a sense of mystery, awe, curiosity or just simple fun with our customizable lighting system that allows you to create separate lighting schemes for both day and night time. Substrate The substrate is an important part of any aquarium. It can be sculpted to make a dramatic landscape for fish and plants to inhabit Backdrops The environment that your aquarium sits in can be key to bringing your creative vision to life. Night And Day The behaviour of an ecosystem can change drastically from day to night. You can control the exact timing of this cycle to balance with precision how these changes occur. Plumbing Fishery's unique plumbing system allows you to finely tune the water conditions for every aquarium you create. Maintaining balanced water chemistry is the key of keeping a successful aquarium. In Fishery that can be done naturally or by artificial means. You can decide on the methods used to achieve the perfect ecological balance. Breeding You will know if your fish are happy and contented in the habitat you have created for them because they will have lots of babies.",
