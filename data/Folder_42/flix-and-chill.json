    "About the game": "Flix &amp; Chill is a dating simulator where your end goal is to get your date to 'Flix &amp; Chill' with you. Do you have what it takes to do the bowchickawowow? In Flix &amp; Chill you take on the role of various individuals on their first blind date, your goal is to woo them, or not, it’s entirely up to you. Tread carefully though or your date may leave to go to the bathroom and never return. Each episode will introduce you to new characters and their own branching dialogue decisions with moral choices and a multitude of unique endings. Help Trevor overcome his need to be a “Pickup artist” and make him open up to show Samantha who he really is or she might just go home with her mustache’d hipster friend and leave Trevor clutching his cold pumpkin-spice-autumn-explosion. Get Anthony past the obnoxious bouncer and help him moonwalk his way across the dancefloor and into Kim’s heart or risk making a fool of yourself on the dancefloor. Help Jasmin dig deeper into Jake’s seemingly immature and lazy exterior and find out if he has any redeeming qualities or is he just a good for nothing that deserves to be friendzoned? Or just kick his ass at Wiggle Wiggle Revolution. Mark is a computer genius, revolutionizing the tech startup industry with his toilet paper renewal service but does he have enough skills on the dancefloor to win the attention of the cute Latina over in the corner or will he end up dancing with Grandma saggytits? Jason likes to get straight to business and invites Marta over to his place for some Flix and Chill, he has the Flix covered but can he say the right things to get her to chill? Will he have her at hello or will she wave goodbye before the credits roll?",
