    "About the game": "Forsake is a 1 to 4 player co-op online psychological horror game where each player is a member of an urban explorer group. Enter places that are off limits and full of paranormal activity to discover their darkest secrets, while risking your life. Are you ready to scream in fear? Explore, loot and complete missions! - Alone or in a group, enter haunted locations to explore every inch of them by opening closed areas with hidden codes, secret mechanisms and keys! - Loot to earn money and buy equipment to help you on your next exploration! - Exorcise the place and complete bonus missions to gain experience and unlock content such as new maps and Urbex gear! But watch out for yourself and your friends, the paranormal entities that haunt the area will be your worst nightmare and will only have one wish, your death. Escape at any time during an exploration to bring back your loot and come back later better equipped to face the entities! Forsake offers: - Great replayability Parts of each map are randomly generated to create many variations of the same location. Items and loot are also randomized, ensuring that you never have two identical explorations. - Entities with unique behaviors Each location is haunted by its own entities, and each has its own unique behavior. Get to know their particularities to better exorcise them! - Your equipment, your gameplay Choose 3 pieces of equipment to go exploring. You can choose Urbex equipment to avoid attracting attention. - Missions and exploration Complete the main mission, bonus missions, or just grind explorations to upgrade your inventory. One step back two steps forward. - Proximity voice chat for total immersion Talk directly in-game with your exploration group to live the horrific experience at 1000%! - Regular updates (every 1 to 2 weeks), with in the coming weeks: * A bestiary to be completed by meeting the entities in exploration * A skill tree offering you special skills * New maps, new entities and new equipment * A progression and difficulty system",
