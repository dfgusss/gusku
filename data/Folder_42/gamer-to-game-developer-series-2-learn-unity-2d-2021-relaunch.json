    "About the game": "A new tutorial series for Unity 2021, released in September 2021 Welcome to Gamer To Game Developer Series 2 LEARN UNITY 2D, a brand new tutorial series relaunched for Unity 2021! In this series you will learn how to use the Unity 2D tilemap dynamically so that you develop a neat 2D construction system so that in game the player can place and remove tiles, and for the navmesh to update dynamically, and of course saving and loading that data to file and managing multiple save files. You will develop a day and night system and write AI that will respond to the time of day! These are fundamental topics to understand for developing Terraria like games, and what you learn in this series will be beneficial in many different projects especially for understanding how to save and load data to file and manage multiple save files. You can watch this series on YouTube, but this package has the added advantage of project folders for each video and of course the videos downloaded to your computer, plus you are directly supporting me when you buy this here on Steam and a lot of credit goes to my customers for helping me to keep GTGD going for 10 years. Why learn game development? I’m not sure I can tell you why you should learn game development, but I can tell you what I’ve found from my experience over the last ten years. I find developing my own games to be the most fun and it can be a challenging experience and amazing whenever I find myself developing new systems in code. My ability to think critically, solve problems, and learn new things has improved over the years and I do attribute some of this to experience gained from game development. It is also rewarding personally and financially that I can develop something, inspire people and also earn some income. Game development I think is a great way for earning passive income. Also, Unity is free to use so it makes it easy for me to develop with a very limited budget. Over the years several of my viewers have written to me to thank me and let me know that I helped inspire them to take a career in game development or software engineering and how happy they were. Those are mega highlights for me. What you’ll learn These video tutorials are for beginner to intermediate level Unity developers and here’s what you’ll learn: How to code in C# Setting up a new 2D project, understanding the interface and switching to Universal rendering. Setting up tilemaps and bringing in tilemap extras. Drawing simple pixel art. Develop a construction system so you can place tiles and delete tiles in game. Scene management, having a main menu scene and a game scene. Save and load all your game world information. You'll use PlayerPrefs for simple data, and Json for writing and reading more complex data to file. You’ll be able to see all save files and select which one to load. Understand how to use the tilemap tools and create animated tilemap tiles. Integrate Navmesh Plus and setup the player to use a navmesh. Integrate Cinemachine so the camera follows the player without having to write any code. Understand sorting orders and how to effectively set it up without code. This will allow objects to appear in front of others based on their Y axis position. Create a day night system and change the light colour of the world as time progresses. Implement shadow casting for tilemaps! Write AI that responds to the time of day. Universal render pipeline post processing. Launcher S2 comes with a fast launcher that gives you quick access to all S2 resources. The launcher will open the folder containing tutorial videos, which are in .mp4 format. The videos are in 1080p and please feel free to copy them to any device for viewing at your convenience as you like. Inside are also all of the video by video project folders so you have direct access to the code for debugging or direct usage if you’re a more advanced developer. Feel free to use the code in your own projects, commercial etc.",
