The year is nineteen seventy something and you are about to take your dog Trigger for one of your weekly sunday hikes in the forest. Up until now, you've explored a new location every week, pleasant times have been had and good memories have been made. This particular Sunday, Trigger senses something and he runs off chasing whatever it is. Naturally, you follow. You wouldn't leave your best friend behind, would you?.. As the day settles and the night approaches you run after your best friend. Suddenly you notice you don't know where you are and there is something eerie about this place. You can't turn back, you don't even know where back is, you can only push forward, clinging to the hope that you will be reunited with your best friend. You are lost and confused, scared and alone, the dark and unknown makes a chill go down your spine, you've gone astray .
