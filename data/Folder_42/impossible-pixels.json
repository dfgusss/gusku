    "About the game": "Can you manoeuvre your mouse through the impossible ? Impossible Pixels is a visually appealing bullet-hell pixel game with tons of action and an entertaining but not obligatory story. Use your mouse, patience and quick reflexes to evade a barrage of oncoming foes and make your way through 14+ unique, hand-crafted levels . Ready to rip your hair out in frustration? Epilepsy warning: This game contains flashing lights that may make it unsuitable for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitive conditions. Player discretion is advised. Each level has been made to pose a different challenge to the player, testing reflexes, patience and their ability to adapt to each levels atmosphere and music, the rhytm of which should help the player navigate through each stage of the game. The soundtrack itself has been crafted by a gifted composer who goes by Robin Mood, a professional in his field with over 15 songs to his name as well as a newly released album and by Krystofoxik. Bullet-hell games rarely have lore or a story to follow, that is not the case with Impossible Pixels, the story itself is not the center of the game but if the player is observant they can find many easter eggs and hints about what's really going on behind the scenes.",
