    "About the game": "Have you ever had the urge to fight a friend? In Kerfuffight, you'll soon be able to teach your friends a lesson! Up to 4 players will be able to fight each other across 3 different biomes, each with their unique stages and distinctive weapons. Biomes are more than just visually different, they all have a special mechanical identity. From long-range battles to close range encounters, all bring their own niche to the table in their own way. Want to customize your gameplay experience further? Choose the game mode that better suits your needs. Fight for the highest score, be the last one standing, try to win over multiple rounds, etc... None of your friends are available? No problem! You can play against AI opponents in any game mode. If you want something a bit more challenging, you can also try to complete Kerfuffight’s solo challenges where one player can attempt to fight a horde of AI opponents, survive for a set amount of time or win the highest amount of rounds! Be it when playing in versus or when completing challenges, you can customize your character to your liking by picking the face, color and hat of your choice. Players also have the possibility to unlock more customization by simply playing the game. The unlock menu will let players know what’s next and help them set goals toward the next customization they can obtain.",
