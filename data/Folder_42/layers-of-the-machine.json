    "About the game": "The night is dark and full of terrors ... ...and 46 layers below the earth's surface, it is always night . And there are plenty of terrors . Enter the dark cyberpunk world of Layers of the Machine, a firstperson shooter made in Unreal Engine 4. Only two years after the Man-Machine-Treaty was first agreed upon, Liam was one of the first humans to set foot in this new world the Machines had created, deep below the surface of the earth. Liam was one of the first contractors allowed to enter 'The Layers', as the Machines called their underground world. Not really welcomed down here in this efficient and cold place, but tolerated, and well-compensated to do the work the Machines deemed inefficient for other fellow Machines to do. It is a high risk, high reward job - Drones in the sky are sweep searching the area for illegal humans. If caught in their head light, the drones will not hurt you. The huge Machine they are reporting to however, will. However, as long as you've got your contract and you don't stray to far from the tasks you were given, you will be alright . You will be just fine...just, under no circumstances , give in to the temptation to enter the Machines' VR System . This virtual world, fabricated by the Machines, is a barren place, vast and empty. It is a near identical replication of reality. Why it was designed and implemented by the Machines remains unknown. The VR world has it's own rules, it's own logic.",
