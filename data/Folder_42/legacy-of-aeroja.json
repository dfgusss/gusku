    "About the game": "Legacy of Aeroja is a game made in RPG Maker MV that uses the ABS Plugin by Phoenix_Ru.86/PhoenixKageDesu. It is made up of five major story acts and a postgame. It is rich with side content and dungeons that contain puzzles and bosses. It has many classic RPG mechanics such as hidden bosses, unique equipment and skills, rewarding exploration of side content, and is equally as rich with story, lore, and worldbuilding. It is the first game in the LoA franchise, a fantasy world filled with backstory that combines positive aspects of both realistic fantasy and high fantasy to generate a world filled with political intrigue, culture, the impact of fantasy elements in realistic societies, and many small details that give the world life. This world is a vehicle for meaningful stories following themes not often discussed in fantasy such as toxicity or modern existential problems, and will utilize ludonarrative(writing told through game mechanics) elements to enhance every part of the experience. Most importantly, this world is something you can be a part of, so join us for our first foray into it! ABS Plugin by KageDesu(all needed credits in game end credits) Legacy of Aeroja is a non-commercial product. It is not endorsed by the original license holder of the ABS Plugin. Any changes made to the plugin fall under the same license agreement as the plugin.",
