    "About the game": "TO PROTECT AND SERVE While answering a routine call on a patrol, Dolphin, Star, and Trouble -the most popular officers of the super-powered law enforcement agency, Stronghold- find themselves in a sequence of events that will alter the fate of the entire city. EXCESSIVE FORCE Let’s get one thing straight; if you ever think that a day in the life of a super-powered law enforcer is easy, you couldn’t be more wrong, as there are greater threats than street gangs in urban fantasy-themed Mayhem Brawler. Using your arsenal of combos and special abilities, you and your co-op teammates should make life miserable for those super-powered criminals, fend yourself from the fury of werewolves, resist the hexes of street wizards and confront the megacorp led by vampire houses that enforce their goons to do their dirty deeds. THE MAYHEM UNIVERSE Comic book-inspired hand-drawn backgrounds and frame-by-frame animations coupled with a kick-ass soundtrack will deliver a jolt of adrenaline to your controller. With the choices you make, you will shape the flow of the story and finally reach one of the three different endings in the Mayhem Brawler universe, where each corner has a story to tell. GAME FEATURES A fresh take on classic 90s-style beat 'em ups. Offline co-op mode that supports up to 4 players. Ability to alter the game flow with player-led decisions. Fully voice-acted story experience and 11 different language options for subtitles. 3 unique endings based on the player’s choices. Unique combat mechanics. 4 playable characters against 30 mobs including 12 unique bosses. Hand-drawn comic book-inspired art, frame-by-frame animated characters, and a rocking soundtrack. Your admission ticket to the limitless universe of Mayhem.",
