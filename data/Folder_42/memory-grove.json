    "About the game": "Memory Grove is an experimental mood tracker where your journal entries fill an explorable library and provide the resources needed to create and customize your own garden. Practice mindfulness and thoughtful reflection as you fill an empty library with your own memories and attract guests back into its halls. FEATURES: Mood Journaling: Using a simple interface, you can record a short message and how you are feeling just like most mood trackers, your messages are then saved and added to the shelves of your library for you to revisit whenever you explore the library. Relaxing Vibes: Take a stroll through the surrounding forests and relax to the sounds of nature and the accompanying tranquil soundtrack. You may even find coins for your garden and secret spots with fantastic views. Create your Garden: Earn coins by recording memories each day, using those coins to customize your own garden paradise. Choose from a wide variety of plants, trees and props to create a garden that is unique to you. Memory Grove even encourages you to keep up your journaling by rewarding consistent players with bonus coins for the garden.",
