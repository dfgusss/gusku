    "About the game": "Assemble a team of mercenaries and challenge the computer or another player in a quick turn-based battle. Unlock new mercs, find the best skill combos, and watch your adorable tiny soldiers blow themselves up in a variety of hex-mapped, low-poly environments. Key Features: Merc selection: assemble your squad from a selection of unique mercenaries, each of whom brings to the team 3 skills and a passive trait. Unlock new mercs by winning battles. Tactical challenges: take advantage of cover to keep your mercs alive, capture objectives to gain Action Points that can be spent to activate their skills, complete specific mission objectives to win. No luck involved: attacks always hit, skills always work in a predictable way. Games are won by outthinking the opponent, not by luck. Random board generation: different environments and randomly generated terrain ensure that no two battles are the same. Game modes: play against the computer in single player mode, or against another player in local and online multiplayer.",
