    "About the game": "Midnight Ohota is an arcade flight simulator that combines cyberpunk with 80s retro futurism. This time, players will fly the most fashionable fighter jets around the night city and shoot down the enemy's barrage airships, gaining extra points by flying through stylish levitating rings. And all this under the most powerful post-punk. Core mechanics: The margin of strength and endurance of the airframe, after which the airplane explodes and flies apart; The plane explodes on impact; Fuel stock that is spent over time; Afterburner mode of the engine, which increases fuel consumption; Wild ramming and blowing of barraging airships by missiles is one of the key features of the game",
