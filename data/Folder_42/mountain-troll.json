Imagine that you are the kindest Troll in the world and someone stole your stuff, you have to get them back! Your main purpose in this game is picking up stolen bags. After all items in the level are collected, the door into the dwelling of the Troll opens, after which you will be directed to the next level. But don't think that it would be so easy, someone clearly does not want you to help the Troll collect the bags, on your way there are various traps, like bear traps and jagged rocks. Be careful, this game won't let you get bored.",
