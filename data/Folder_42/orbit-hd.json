    "About the game": "Embark on a journey through the depths of space, and uncover an ancient legend. In Orbit, you play a small comet, hurtling between planets to a backdrop of procedurally generated nebulae and star clusters. A realistic gravity system is at the core, allowing players to have as much, or as little input as desired, watching while their comet flies into unpredictable new orbit patterns. Key Features: • Explore the cosmos as a comet, orbiting planets with a realistic gravity system. • Blast through portals and warps in space and time. • Unlock new skins and skills to make your comet stronger and faster. • Explore 5 pockets of space spread over 40 levels. • Unearth an ancient tale by collecting strange objects known as Matter. • Marvel at procedurally generated nebulae and star clusters. • Explore at your leisure in the relaxing Drift mode.",
