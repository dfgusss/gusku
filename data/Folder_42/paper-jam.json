    "Release date": "Apr 1, 2021",
    "About the game": "It was a time of.. robots reading books! Sadly, all of the printing presses are damaged and they miss single words from each new book. As a new recruit to Ro-Books bookstore, it's your job to make words to complete a book for each customer. You'll need to serve all of the customers before the day is up, or else it's game over! Can you make enough words in time? Can you solve anagrams in the bonus rounds? Paper Jam! puts you inside a bookshop, meeting a diverse range of customers in either a career mode - where you get to uncover the story of the robots - or in a quick game mode where you can climb your way up the global leaderboards. If you love word games, Paper Jam! may be a game you'll love to play as much as we loved making it! This is one of the first ever VR word games, which means it's both a physical and a mental game. You will need to use two hands to operate the typewriter to make words with so, as you're having a great time, remember to look after yourself and take breaks if you start to feel tired.",
