This tool has the ability to switch the physical dimension of certain objects, as well as your own. There is the normal dimension, which you are used. It collides with everything. Then there is a blue and an orange dimension. These dimensions only collide with the same color/dimension as well as the normal dimension. You will have to discover how this strange tool works, using your wit to complete intricate tests.",
