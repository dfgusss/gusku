    "About the game": "Experience futuristic vehicular combat in this fast paced strategy game. Assemble your team from a crew of fully realized AI companions as you take part in epic land battles. Your objective is to destroy the enemies base before they destroy yours. You and your team will need to fight for control of outposts along the way which provide you with additional troops, turrets, and access to powerful new weapons. With a unique balance of strategy and action, Planet 2000 allows players to win battles through brilliant strategy, pure combat skill, or a combination of both. This game is mainly centered around online multiplayer. That being said, it plays so differently than anything you've likely played before that I strongly encourage you to at least start the single player campaign before jumping online. The single player campaign is the best way to prepare yourself for online play. This game does not feature built-in voice chat.We have set up a Discord server for the game for anyone who wants to find other players to team up with online.",
