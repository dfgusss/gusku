    "About the game": "The Planet After Us computer game is an RPG set in a 3D world. The game world is not very large and is designed for five hours of playthrough, although in fact the game can take much longer on the first playthrough. The game has several professions that you need to learn and upgrade in order to collect resources and transform them into goods for sale. You will also have to learn the profession of a key maker in order to open the locks of chests. And of course, the most important thing is the pumping of various skills for fighting with opponents.

At the same time, the armor of opponents can also have different thicknesses and other parameters, due to which you may not be able to penetrate it, or vice versa, you will crit with every shot. Therefore, you will have to collect complex sets of weapons to kill every serious enemy. A feature of the game world is the presence of a super-dense atmosphere, due to which the projectiles fly slowly and during the battle the enemy can dodge your shot, so that even a volley from four different guns at the same time can be carried out past the target. It is necessary to predict the position of the enemy in space and strike ahead of time, correctly calculating the trajectory. The atmosphere of the game is generally relaxing, the opponents are not scary, even those areas where evil has settled, cemeteries with crucified skeletons look quite peaceful. Mostly a pleasant, pleasing to the eye beautiful landscape, strange trees, strange objects. What can I say this world was designed by robots.
