    "About the game": "2022: Worldwide Chaos and Devastation! With the war in the Ukraine, the planet is in chaos and nothing will ever be the same again. What's more, there is the threat of global warming, the lingering Covid epidemic along with the risk of new variants, inflation and increased prices on the planet's key resources. Alongside the base game mode, which allows you to play as any head of state or opposition leader in the world controlling one or multiple nations, the 2022 Edition offers multiple scenarios. In the Ukraine scenario, save the country by playing as the Ukraine and one or more NATO countries, by resisting the advance of Russian tanks, by supporting the Ukrainian army, by urging financial sanctions against Russia, by accepting refugees, by making the Russian president unpopular in the eyes of the people or by influencing China to officially oppose the conflict, all while avoiding escalation. The scenario on global warming involves adjusting your goals for reducing CO2 emissions. Climate Change Conferences (COP) have been added. You can also influence other countries to go further in their goals, with the artificial intelligence of leaders simulating their behavior on the subject, ultimately allowing you to see the real development of worldwide climate change up to the year 2100. In the 'Animal Welfare' scenario, your objective is to become one of the most honorable countries in the world regarding animal rights. To do this, you will have a specific budget and an arsenal of legislation on hunting, animal rights and various other regulations (bullfighting, production of foie gras, battery farming...). The 'French Elections' scenario allows you to play as any candidate in the French election in April 2022. Besides these scenarios, the game also has new features including: simulating the appearance and development of conspiracy theories with new budgets and actions on the internet and social media, inclusion of fake news with the possibility of combating them or creating them, the development of secret services abroad along with the manipulation of social media and improvements allowing the overthrow of a foreign head of state, management of Covid in 2022 with vaccine boosters and the simulation of new variants, the development of garbage recycling along with a new tax on the use of plastic packaging, the addition of military battle robots, new SMR nuclear power plants, new music awards (Eurovision, Grammy Awards) and sports (eSports, MMA) and numerous improvements on the God'n'Spy add on, including the detailed calculation of the level of dictatorship in a country.
