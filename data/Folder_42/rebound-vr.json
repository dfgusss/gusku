    "About the game": "Rebound VR is a fun and absorbing mix of racquetball and breakout-style game-play. - 42 levels spread across 9 different arenas. - 4 difficulty levels from Easy to Extreme. - Each level played against the clock and with limited lives. - Hours of game-play that tests your reactions and coordination. - Extending bats help you reach balls outside your chaperone area. - Tractor beam powerup to pull the ball towards you or give it a wee nudge. - Autosaves so you can return to your game. - Practise hall. - Room scale recommended but can be played seated or standing only. You don't need to wallop the ball - but you can if you like. Just don't take your eye off the red one....",
