    "About the game": "A WORLD THAT DESIRES YOUR DEATH You and your friends find yourself in a strange, unforgiving place. Frantically you seek a way out, but death lurks at every corner, and when it finds you — that’s when your resolve is rewarded with the ability to rewind time. What path will lead you out? What decisions will you have to make? And what secrets will you uncover in the dark? A RICH TRADITION Explore a beautifully atmospheric 2D world with a mix of pixel art and painted portraits. Within it you’ll find a mixture of traditional logic puzzles and heart-pounding action sequences, as well as secrets and mysteries. DEATH IS YOUR TEACHER This world desires your death, but that does not mean the end. Use what you learn on one path to explore further down another. Find shortcuts, piece together clues and study patterns that will lead you to victory. USE YOUR HEAD OR LOSE IT Freya is faced with locked door after locked door in her quest to escape, and the only way to unlock them is to play her captor's game--solving the logic puzzles contained within each room. The consequences for getting them wrong can be ... unpleasant. QUEER ROMANCE IN DANGEROUS PLACES Complicating matters is Freya's long-standing crush on her best friend, Mia. Will the terror of their experience bring them closer together, or tear them apart? And what of Claire, the prisoner who admires Freya as her saviour? Freya's choices will influence more than just her survival, but also her relationships. ABOUT THE TEAM Retrace is being developed by Spider Lily Studios lead developer Els White, with programming assistance by Julian Adams, art by @rustorange and music by harmonicblend.",
