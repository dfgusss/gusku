    "About the game": "Overview: SCP: Blackout is a Desktop/VR game coming out on Steam in Summer 2019. It is a surreal horror game with a branching narrative. As a new D-Class transferred to Site-50, you must decide what you want to do as you navigate through the facility trying to survive various malicious SCP entities, determining what choices to make, and collecting pieces of the story to truly understand what is going on. In the story mode (Not yet available in Early Access), as you play you can listen to Dr. Millar or Dr. Slate, each with their own motives and goals. Each choice and path you make affects the facility and playthrough, leading to many different possible endings. Each time you play, more of the story will be uncovered, and maybe the best choices aren’t the ones so obviously presented. For quick action an hard-core horror filled fast rounds, you can try the Survival Gamemode, where you are dropped in with the full facility to explore and escape from with smaller story with Dr. Harman. Features: VR (Vive and Oculus) OR normal desktop. An immersive horror atmosphere. Branching narrative with semi-rouge-like features to ensure every play through is different.
