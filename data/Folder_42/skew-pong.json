    "About the game": "Learn to Skew with it ! You might be used to playing Pong, but this is no classic one. With an unstable 3D board that can be pushed around and that bends from the paddles' weight , you will have to adapt as gravity and inertia influence the ball . Use them to your advantage to win against your opponent. Play against your Friends or AIs ! Invite some friends to your house or through Steam's Remote Play Together to defy them in 2-player Couch Versus . You can play either on a single keyboard or with gamepads . No friends available to play with you ? It's not an issue, as you can play alone and face the AI with multiple levels of difficulty . Don't feel like playing ? It's fine, you can even watch AI vs AI matches. Fully customize the matches to your needs ! Several game modes are available for variety of gameplay . Even better, a lot of options are available to play the way you want to. From simply changing your paddle's color to switching between 2D and 3D perspective . You can go all the way from playing an extreme game to just doing a classic 2D Pong match.",
