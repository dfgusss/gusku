    "About the game": "Test your problem-solving skills - simply slide the coloured blocks on to their corresponding goals. Once you start a block moving, it will not stop until it hits something. Sometimes you will have to time your moves so that one block stops another. There are over 100 levels to test you and now, with the built-in level editor, you can create your own levels and share them via Steam Workshop. You can earn up to three stars per level - one for solving the problem; a second for beating the target time and the third for beating the target number of moves. When you create your own levels in the editor, you must prove that your targets are possible before you are permitted to upload. In a hurry? No problem! We've added 'Turbo Mode' where time goes twice as fast. That means less time waiting for the sliders to reach their destination. This is a great way to experiment and find the best solution for a level before going back to 'normal speed' to get the best possible finishing time.",
