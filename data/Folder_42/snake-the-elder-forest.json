    "About the game": "Snake: The Elder Forest is an casual-adventure game currently in development by two-man 'team' called Fractal Dimension Games. The Elder Forest is a special world with ancient forest that is in danger. To save this world the Snake was called from another one. The energy of those worlds is different so all 'aliens' (including your character) can only be in sphere form and can't stop to be alive! The Snake has ability to use this energy gaining more power and learning new skills, but it is weak at the start, so before the danger is coming, you should become more powerful to be ready to repel the Elder Forest! During gameplay you'll meet a lot of challenges, traps and puzzles that you ought to solve! Look below to see some of the game's highlights :) Variety of skills You can use different skills in order to easier pass traps. Or combine them: Replayability You can create different profiles inside of your game, so you can try different difficulty. If you want to relax you can choose 'Easy' or playing hardcore 'Hard'. For best experience we recommend to play 'Normal' difficutly. Changing difficulty to higher one changes your speed, traps and everything becomes harder, you can see the difference below. If you are interested, you can help us to improve this game!",
