Don't forget that you have your teleport and shield abilities to use and try to get the edge in the battle as well! Features: 2-6* player battles Expanding list of maps that offer varied gameplay Powerups Physics-enabled world Customizable game rules Unlockable skins, cosmetics &amp; content Sport based mode ...and more! * 5-6 player battles can only use up to 4 xbox gamepads at a time, then use alternate types for the other two players.",
