    "About the game": "Swarm Queen is a quick-to-learn , tactical , and challenging tug-of-war strategy game about insect-like aliens battling over Jupiter's moon, Europa.                                       Your beautiful minions control themselves , using 'fuzzy logic' to pick the best target. Since your swarm fights on its own, your job as the queen is to focus on strategy . Gather resources with 'Harvester' units, mutate your eggs into new types of minions, build your army , and spit globs of Neurotoxin at the enemy horde while the battle rages on. In the biggest update yet, version 2.0 includes an alternate 'cartoon' art style , Steam achievements , visible enemy ' emotions ', an 'easy' difficulty setting , and more !                         Build your army out of 18 different minions, from electricity-shooting shell-covered beasts , to flying bat-like bomb-carriers , each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Unlock new creatures and abilities as you play through dozens of levels , including bonus ' challenge levels ' which put a twist on the normal gameplay. For a tough battle, replay levels on hard mode , or try the ' New Game Plus ' mode added in a free update. Swarm Queen is inspired by insects , and classic sci-fi aliens like Xenomorphs, Zerg, and the 'Bugs' from Starship Troopers. It's like a war between ant colonies.. but in space!                  Swarm Queen contains a '100% scientifically accurate' depiction of Jupiter's moon Europa, including all of the alien life. No , it's not covered in ice. NASA is lying to you. The Earth is flat. The president is a reptilian. The universe is a hologram. BUY GOLD.                                                             Swarm Queen is a one-man indie project and first commercial release from Canadian developer Helmi Bastami, formerly a hobbyist animator and creator of Flash games on Flyborg.net",
