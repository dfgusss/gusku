    "About the game": "The Synth Riders Beatmap Editor is a free tool for Windows that allows you to take your own music and choreograph movements to match! With this tool you can place notes, obstacles and rails so that they synchronise with the music, which you can then load and play as a Custom Song in Synth Riders. Core Features: Rebindable hotkeys Customizable note colours Place, move and rotate obstables Edit rails by adding, moving or deleting rail nodes without replacing the rail Smart object scrolling - quickly jump between objects of a given type (notes, rails, obstacles) Change the comfort grid style or toggle it off completely for a clear view Toggle snap-to-grid to allow free placement or change the grid size for smaller precision placement Create bookmarks and switch between next/previous with a hotkey Custom difficulty with customizable note jump speed Public Beta Available! Want more features? We have a Public Beta in test and encourage you to give it a try! Public Beta Features: Advanced Selection Options: Copy, paste, mirror or delete objects selectively Snap to Rail: Easily place or paste notes onto rails Gridless Rail Move: when snap to grid is off, rail heads and nodes can be dragged off-grid Move Rail Head: you can now move a rail head without moving the entire rail with it (ctrl + left click drag). You can still move an entire rail at once with alt drag. Power Mode: Optionally place notes without overwriting existing notes on the same plane Note Outline Toggle: See objects that are obscured by other objects Free Camera Improvements: free camera now moves more responsively (hold right click and use WASD + Q/E while in free camera mode). 9 now resets the free camera position. Additional Obstacle Types: square, triangle shapes Measure Indicator: shows what bar or beat your editor plane is on.
