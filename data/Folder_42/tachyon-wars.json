    "About the game": "Tachyon Wars is an open space stellar strategy game. It introduces seriously deep gameplay with an emphasis on fleet control. It game has it all. Open space to explore, large-scale battles, crafty AI, and powerful space fleet control. All of it is well seasoned with novel real-time game mechanics. Uncover the secret of dark matter and construct fierce space fleets. Reveal enemies' plans with tachyon scanners and sabotage the enemy cargo flows. Test gravity weapons and bomb them away from their home planets! As in many good strategy games, in Tachyon Wars you will have to balance between scanning your territory and frontline, running diversion missions, defending your own colonies, and bombing pesky AI (or your best friend?) out. A variety of ship modules brings extra to your strategic planning. Decide on where to move next - an invisible naughty spy, heavy tank, or light and fast attacker? Heavy but defenseless (and cheap) fighter carrier or something that rocks the stars? Choose your weapons: fire and runaway rockets, long-range lasers, or shredding to bits cannons? Or maybe induce a gravity wave explosion that crumples everything around including the firing ship? Planets management was brought to a minimum and it is based on the economic triangle (new!). With the economy triangle it is easier to balance the planet production focus without tedious planet constructions - it is either defenseless science planets, mining, or production. Make sure your frontline planets have planet defense to sustain bombing. Gameplay video -3to&amp;ab_channel=TachyonWars Planet resources are scarce, so you would need to organize and support a chain of supplies from mining to building planets. Destroying supplies will break the economy of even the strongest, so bring a lot of attention to planet scanners, scout patrols, and don't forget spying on your own! Tachyon Wars was envisaged as a multi-player experience and runs in real-time, to support simultaneous multiplayer games. Though this is different from typical RTS games, here you can pause the game and plan your next move. You can play games with a mixed set of computer or human players. Cooperative or PvP - it's your choice. Beware, the AI tactics are tailored for clever veteran strategy players and won't keep you bored! Please leave comments on what you like or dislike about this game. I value and am open to any feedback as far as it's positive :). I am keen to keep tailoring the game to your views.
