    "About the game": "TAD: That Alien Dude® PERMADEATH EDITION Gameplay You control TAD: That Alien Dude on his quest to escape the infamous Area 91, where he and his cartoon pals of yesteryear have been 'protected' by the US Government since the early 1990s. Control TAD in a 2D open world with your keyboard or joypad, fighting off enemies with Pigman's Blade of Avalon, the only known weapon in the Toon Alley sector of Area 91. With your blade, move through a postmodern map reminiscent of RPGs from 'back in the day,' where you'll encounter pixel perfect scientists, transhumanists, reptoids, and more as you escape a nightmare of quests, trying to take down whatever nefarious forces are truly controlling Area 91 so that you may return to Hollywoodland, and reintegrate yourself into the animation landscape of today. With 5 Dungeons and bosses, multiple quests, and a whole lot of original pixel art with an original synthwave OST, do you have what it takes to get the highest score? Features * Multilevel map of Area 91, the infamous government military installation that holds living simulations, nuclear reactors, and more madness than a government regime should have access to. * RPG mechanics: As you go on quests for your fellow captives, er, neighbors, discover the hidden secrets of Area 91 and level up your player and the Blade of Avalon's power. * Hand drawn pixel art and original soundtrack: All pixel art and music composed especially for this release * 5 Dungeons: Each dungeon has it's own boss, bosses move along paths based on the application of Catastrophe Theory (Oooh! Real science! KEEN!) * Longform Animated Cutscenes: A storyline so wild and exciting, you might forget you aren't watching a Saturday Morning Cartoon show!",
