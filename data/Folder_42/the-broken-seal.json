    "About the game": "Welcome! We've spent the last couple years to create this vast, immersive and magical world and we’re incredibly excited to finally share it with you! Welcome to 'The Broken Seal!' We were tired of all the short, demo-like VR experiences out there and set out to design a full, feature-rich VR game with a level of depth you probably haven’t seen in VR before! In this world, experience immersion on an entirely new level as you can release magic using your own voice by speaking or shouting the spells you cast! Stay tuned for even more content! Though the game has left EA, we’re still committed to its continued development. We are working on adding new, exciting features such as more magic spells, new systems, new areas, more monsters, and so much more! Just in: We wanted a way to let gamers without VR to enjoy questing too, so we created an all new Non-VR mode. Now anyone can join together in this adventure to help rid the world of evil! The Broken Seal is a game designed from the ground up for virtual reality, supporting the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift, but now allows “pancake” (non-VR players) to join up too! The ancient seal has been broken, the powers of darkness are devouring everything in the world. Now the world desperately needs a HERO to save it from impending catastrophe. Game Features: ◆More than 40 hours of game content: A complete and fully featured game with levels of depth that’s deeper than just about every VR game you've experienced so far. ◆ Voice control: Use your own voice to cast spells! Forget hunting through menus - experience a new level of immersion as you wield magic in a much more realistic way than just pressing a button! It’s truly a unique and magical experience that we’re excited to share with you! ◆ Fantastic physics: we worked hard to make battling with different weapon types feel right in VR. Utilizing the Unreal Engine 4, we’ve been able to create a combat system that really lets you feel like you're fighting! In a genre that’s usually defined as “hack and slash,” now your questing actually requires real skill on a level that wasn’t possible before VR. ◆ Multiplayer mode. You are not alone in this world. Try playing multiplayer with your friends or summon pets to fight along side with you. Now you can even join up with non-VR players to fight in this epic quest! ◆ Dozens of various spells: Each spell has exciting, unique characteristics that evolve in different ways as you progress throughout the game. ◆ Looting: Get weapons and equipment as well as other kinds of loot during your battles and quests. Use what you find to strengthen and upgrade yourself to better fight the coming darkness! ◆ Vast, epic environments: Battle your way through forests, ancient relics, deserts, and snow covered mountains as you fight to cleanse the world of evil. We’re a small team, but we’re extremely dedicated to this project. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to us!
