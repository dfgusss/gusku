    "About the game": "Humankind has faced earthquakes, volcanoes, floods and hurricanes—but the most dangerous natural disaster is a weather phenomenon known as the 'Tornuffalo.' A 'Tornuffalo' is formed when a layer of warm, moist air meets a layer of cold, dry air which meets a herd of angry buffalo. Note: A true meteorozoologist would explain that 'buffalo' is an informal term that, in this case, refers to American bison. Dodge fire hydrants, vans and even bison in this room-scale VR game. Hit gems to score points. Make sure to have ample space, and play with the 'chaperone grid' on so you don't run into a wall!",
