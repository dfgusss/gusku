Stack your bricks and use your spells to create the tallest stable tower, for what self-respecting wizard wouldn’t want to show off their skills by towering literally over their peers! But be wary of jealous rivals, who will try and push your tower down with nefarious dark spells to ensure their dominance. Block these spells to protect your tower,… oh and be sure to return the favor with your own devious magics. Match your tower wizardry against 3 others in local multiplayer, or challenge wizards around the world in an online battle of magics and engineering mayhem. Try your skills in various tricky wizard trials and set a high score on the leaderboards. So be sure to bring your wizard’s safety hat and start stacking and tumbling! Features Conjure up your wizard’s tower: cleverly stack your summoned blocks and use over 17 different spells to win the race who has the highest tower Send your rivals tumbling: use dark spells to hamper or even push over your competitors towers, but beware; they can use these spells on you as well!
