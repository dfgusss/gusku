    "About the game": "There are whispers of something ancient stirring beneath the moss and stone. The creatures of the forest stay close to their groves and tread lightly on their trails... Because they know those paths converge at the heart of the forest, and fear what has awoken there. Explore the deep forests in this folklore fantasy tale that pushes the boundaries of strategy games: Settle villages and expand your kingdom in an open world, teeming with magical creatures and their cities. Grow your economy by specializing each village to best use nearby resources. Complete quests to advance your story and gain standing with the creatures of the forest. Focus your production to equip your army with powerful weapons and abilities. From the author Please be aware that the game is in early access, which currently means the game is quite short : most of the quests and buildings in the current build can be completed in about 2 to 3 hours of playtime. You are welcome to join the early access release and watch the forest grow as each update delivers more content, depth, and more reasons to revisit the world.",
