Valhalla, the unstable nation Valhalla is a free trading nation erected by three world powers for their own benefits after the world war. In an attempt to control the nation, the three world powers banned the army from Valhalla. Due to these circumstances, public order in Valhalla is always unstable and thus after ten years the Valhalla government made a bold decision.
