    "About the game": "Uncharted Ocean is a historical sailing RPG in a world of open ocean, islands and ships. Start your journey from the Port of Faro, and face an ever-shifting ocean full of enemies and traders to build up your own fleet. The seas are chaotic, but treasure is waiting for you in the Uncharted Ocean ! On mobile platforms, Uncharted Ocean already has over 500 thousand players exploring the world together. Our team is not only porting the experience to PC, we are enhancing controls, features, graphics, and localization to take the experience to the next level. Uncharted Ocean is now available in Early Access Beta, with everything subject to change until its final launch. Background Uncharted Ocean is a historical simulation sailing RPG set in the Age of Discovery (between 1400 and 1600 CE). European Imperialist fleets began colonizing the world through trade and brutality across dangerous waters. Players can choose from 8 nationalities, each with unique skills, allies and enemies. You’re not alone in the ocean, between ports the world is full of Pirates! You can fight pirates who try to attack you, or you can become a crew of lawless sea dogs yourself. To defend yourself or attack your victims, you can recruit skilled crewmen and construct powerful battleships. How to do that will be up to you! You’ll need cash to finance your growing fleet, pay crewmen, and finance upgraded weapons. To fill your coffers you can trade goods between ports, or turn to piracy and attack other traders on their routes. With enough investment, you can fortify and upgrade ports for better rewards. Features Trading - Players will visit nearly one hundred unique ports when exploring the world based on real historic locations. Each has different goods to trade, and characters to discover. You can even become the Mayor of an entire port city! Naval Battles - Make allies and enemies with other ships at sea. Will you stay on the straight-and-narrow or plunder everyone you meet? Ship Building - Construct an entire fleet by customizing hulls, cannons, figureheads and more. Storm’s A-Brewing - Every time you trim the sails you have to consider wind speed and power. Weather effects like fog and storms will limit your sight and damage your ship. The Cape of Storms is notorious for sinking ships not strong enough to weather through! Duels! - Mano y mano sword showdowns will sometimes decide the fate of characters and crews. Exploration - There’s a whole ocean out there. Find treasure in sunken ruins between ports, with hundreds of collectibles, there’s always better treasure to find. Black Market - sometimes what you need isn’t always available (or legal!) Smugglers are much harder to find but trade in top-shelf goods.",
