I spent a lot of time thinking about what the soul of vaporwave is and what attracts us. It is difficult to have an accurate answer, but we may all have imagined such a picture: driving a car on the highway, listening to music, and watching the vaporwave art scenery outside the window. So I decided to make this picture to a VR game. Some of the art models and music in the game come from my other two games 'Vaporwave World' and 'Vaporwave Drift'. Game Features Drive a car with a sense of science fiction. You can open the car window to feel the wind outside the window. Local music and pictures can be imported. Vaporwave world atmosphere. 4 maps. 7 music. Simple and easy game experience. Support Steam achievements and Steam leaderboards. Gameplay Drive a car on an endless road. Watch the vaporwave scenery. Local music can be imported into car music library,",
