    "About the game": "Wacktory™ is a new take on cooperative gameplay that pushes the limits of both Virtual Reality and traditional couch co-op. The player in VR will take on the role of factory foreman and will work alongside two players outside VR to fill orders, make cubes, and complete trucks, all while trying to beat the clock! When the trucks roll in, there is only so much time before they leave again, so organization and communication is key! The two players outside VR will take on the role of factory robots, helping to fill orders. These robots can pick up crates, box cubes, move items and help get things organized. The player in VR will be in charge of distributing and smashing open crates, and preparing boxes for delivery. In Wacktory, player's aren't just waiting for their turn in VR anymore.",
