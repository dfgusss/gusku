    "About the game": "Embark on a quest in search of ultimate power, lying in the hands of a hoarding entity. Between your goal and you lie a series of challenging levels and colorful areas that, despite their harmless and welcoming appearance, will not hesitate to send you back to the starting line if you miss a beat. With a stripped down, three-button input system, you'll have to master the skills of walking, jumping, dodging deadly hazards, sprinting, gliding and flying... all while on ice! Even the ground you walk on poses a threat! Key Features PLATFORMING... ON ICE : Originally an entry for an ice-themed jam, the frozen landscapes you'll traverse will have you sliding right into harm's way should you not be careful. Watch your speed and momentum, especially under wind currents! MOVEMENT ABILITIES : Essential to beat the trickier challenges, forcing you to re-think how you move around. Double jump to reach new heights, glide through air streams to increase your maneuverability or sprint at a high speed to clear large chasms! 50 LEVELS : Split up on four different areas, each with their own distinct look and feel. A BETTER FINAL BOSS : Deadlier and nastier than before; he's been re-built from the ground-up to crush you again. Again. And Again. NEW GAME+ MODE : Was the first time too easy? Do you just like suffering? Every level (even the boss!) now has a tweaked, more lethal variant just waiting for you. ACHIEVEMENTS AND SECRETS : Aside from the standard progress and challenge types, there are also cryptic and secret feats that unlock a small bonus game! TIMED MODE : Do you keep your cool if there's small time and death counters staring at you constantly, watching your every move and mistake? What if you couldn't even pause to breathe?",
