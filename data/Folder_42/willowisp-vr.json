    "About the game": "Summary Use a pair of light-blades to defend yourself from colorful wisps flying at you from all sides. Cut, thrust, block, and dodge your way through ten levels of intense, swordfighting action. Master your timing, point control, footwork, and peripheral awareness to stay alive. Use the floating mirrors to maintain a 360 degree field of view and never get caught off-guard. This game is highly active, be prepared for a workout! Story Some say the Willowisp is a mischievous fairy, some say a goblin, some the haunting spirit of a sinful human. It is known for its fiery nature and its tendency to lead travelers astray. Curious to see the Wisps for yourself, you ventured into the forest. You walked until the sky grew dark and a fog descended. You came across a pond and decided to rest. Then you saw a green light hovering over the water. Its luminance revealed a path of raised earth. The light beckoned you to follow, and so, carefully, you walked the path as it wound through the water. As you suspected, it was a trap! As had happened to so many travelers before, you had been lured astray by the strange light of the Willowisp to your doom. At least, that was what the Wisp intended. You had other plans. Unlike the others, you knew what would happen and came prepared. You were ready to fight the Wisps and make the forest safe... Additional Features Unlockable endless mode for open-ended challenge. Easy and Hard difficulty settings. Swap hands feature = lefty friendly! Island dynamically resizes to your play-space to accommodate large and small room-scales.",
