A contract can unseal any power within a living being and turn them into a powerful creature. Incarnated into a world of demons, you find yourself caught up in a middle of a demon civil war. You were retrieved by the Rebellions and you were given one choice: To help the Rebellions end of the civil war by conquering Pandemonium, the city where the Demon King resides. The Rebellions finally acquired the power of Incarnates, a Winged Sakura that has incarnated into the demon world, and now is able to make their final move. Aid the Rebellions and uncover the real truth behind this world. Features Turn-Based RPG Combat: Lead your new group of allies into combat and strategically plan their every move. A combat system that is familiar and loved by jRPG fans. Stat Distribution: Want more HP? Put points into VIT! Want more damage? Put points into STR, DEX, or INT! Build your characters and adjust stats any time for any situation. Don't be afraid to experiment because every stat point can be redistributed! Skill Distribution: Learn new skills and decide how you'd like to make your characters stronger. Don't be afraid to experiment because every skill point can be redistributed! Dungeon Crawling: A slightly different approach to first person dungeon crawling RPG games. You'll be moving from randomly generated hallways to randomly generated rooms, which will contain randomly generated events.",
