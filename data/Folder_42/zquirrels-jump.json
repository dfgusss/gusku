    "About the game": "DIE LEARN RESPAWN Zquirrels need your help! Become one of the best jumpers and save the day with your awesome skills. Zquirrel Jump is a hardcore arcade game for people ready to bruise their fingers. Or speedrunners, because they will feel at home. But what does it mean to “save the day” in Zquirrels’ world? It means, save as many nuts as you can before they hit the ground. Obviously. Because there is no worse thing in the world than nuts hitting ground. Keep in mind that it's a very difficult arcade game. You will die hundreds of times. Literally. This game won't show you the ropes, a player has to experiment and learn to find a way to complete a level. It might be a little bit frustrating to repeat the same level again and again, but if you are willing to try, you will be rewarded! Key Features: 40 unique levels made by not random generated people called level designers 7 skills which will make you accomplish something unimaginable A bunch of skins for your Zquirrels and their parachutes 5 biomes, because every good game needs a lava level 3-star scale to tell you how bad was your run 22 comics about Zquirrels, because you somehow have to get to know their story A few Achievements, like in any other new game on Steam! User-friendly level editor, because don’t we all love to create? Very high difficulty Youtube friendly And parachutes! It’s a key feature because without a parachute you would probably fall and die",
