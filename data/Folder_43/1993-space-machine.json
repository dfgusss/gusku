    "About the game": "Space shooters never die. 1993 is a testament to that, honoring classics like Life Force, R-Type and Xenon II. We're keeping the genre alive. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ 1993 S.M was made in 1993. It is not made to look retro. It is not polished for today's tech - this is the genuine thing! It's 1993 - Today! (Further updated in 2020!) What reviewers say: Holy moly! I'm in! I'm sold! This is a freaking phenomenal game. 8-Bit Eric *I am so dead chuffed with this game. Jamie from the Games Shed *1993 Shenandoah has that same level of addictive quality in design and execution. Elliot Ossange - Bonusstage *I absolutely love this game! It is soo charming! Jamie from the Games Shed *The enemy is varied and vast, coming in many flavours and types. There are basically everything and anything you can think of. Elliot Ossange - Bonusstage *This is an absolute gem! I really really recommend this! Jamie from the Games Shed *I can’t recommend 1993 Shenandoah enough. The aesthetics of the design, the levels... Elliot Ossange - Bonusstage *I'm definitely digging the hell out of this game. 8-Bit Eric You're in charge! Explore and secure the different worlds in the order that fits your taste and urge. The kick ass weapon system lets you unlock weapons for use in later play sessions. We feature both classic powerful weapons plus some fresh smart weapons. Of almost 100 deadly enemy types, we have crafted unique evil behaviours for most of them. As an extra game mechanic we have introduced a new health and shield system for more interesting game play. Up to four player co-op mode. In short: 9 Ships to choose from 25 Different weapons with 3 power levels 14 Levels 10 Different Bosses ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Started in the age of the Amiga 500, this game was featured in Amiga format and Commodore User - two of the largest gaming magazines of the time. A series of unfortunate events prevented this space shooter to get finished. We plan to do that now! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Game story: 'Towards the end of the interstellar wars, chaos spread and one band of elite mercenaries acted more like pirates and looters than actual soldiers. The leader of this group was the notorious and infamous Colonel Nestor. Without a doubt the biggest prize of their looting campaigns was the Spacemachine: a device designed to terraform barren planets and making them habitable. With this device, and the rest of their treasure, Nestor and his men started to build an army that now poses a great threat to the known star systems. Mission: Bring back the Space Machine.
