Explore a beautiful and grim world, inspired by the tone and mood of traditional fairy tales. Live through an intense story of hope and empowerment. Find out what it takes to truly break free from all strings attached. STORY 'Ladies and Gentlemen! Come in, come in! In the mood for a story, are we?' Abby is an artiste held captive at a circus: She spends her days entertaining the audience and her nights in a cage, longing for freedom. One day, she escapes the circus and gets to explore a mystical world. Alas, freedom comes at a cost and Abby soon finds herself dragged into the dangers this world has to offer: In a war-torn, medieval fairytale, surrounded by ravaged, starving citizens and hunted by the relentless cut-throat Tonda, Abby has to cross raging rivers, make it through bandit camps and around traps. Her adventure is always accompanied by the lyrical rhymes of puppet master Jack, who is telling her story while holding the strings of his puppets firmly in his ever-helpful hands. Who can Abby trust? Can she find a way to truly break free? Despite dangling from her threads, will Abby learn that she can still influence her destiny? 'Abby, Abby... Don't you see, the threads holding you up – also hold you back.'",
