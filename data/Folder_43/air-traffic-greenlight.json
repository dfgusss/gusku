    "About the game": "Air Traffic: Greenlight is an air traffic control themed game that challenges your spatial ability. The goal is to prevent collisions, organize and expedite the flow of air traffic in the area where radar coverage is limited. Radar Contact You can't see the aircraft that beyond the radar range on the screen, but you can direct it. You can choose to maintain radar identification for safety or use your mental picture of the traffic for efficiency. Deploy Radar Along with the rise of reputation, additional radar facilities are available to deploy. Increase radar coverage in the area by developing your radar network to improve aviation safety. Wind Conditions Keep an eye on the forecast, wind direction and wind speed changes constantly which could limit the direction of takeoff and landing. Terrain All maps are build based on real-world elevation data. Appreciate the nature of the terrain over which an aircraft is flying to avoid hitting anything especially in the mountain area. Aircraft Type Different aircraft type has different takeoff distance, landing distance, approach speed and maximum speed. Gives planning the route and pattern more challenging. Fuel Emergency When an aircraft was held in the air too long, it will run out of fuel and falling from the sky. Sure, the fuel emergency will be declared before that happened. Runway Management You can design your own airport procedure, assign the initial and missed approach heading and altitude to each runway. Replay You can save, watch and share the replay of your game.
