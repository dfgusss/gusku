    "About the game": "In the midst of the snowfields of Greenland lies Alpha Polaris, an American oil research station. High above, the ion storm of the century is gathering, bringing about a strange intermixing of reality and night terrors... Alpha Polaris is an old-school adventure game focusing on character-driven horror and environmental themes. Previously released worldwide in retail, the game features professional voice-acted dialogues, hand-drawn dialogue portraits and an original soundtrack. Alpha Polaris was developed by Turmoil Games, an indie game studio situated in Finnish Lapland, making the game an authentic Arctic production. Developed during two long and dark Finnish winters, inspiration for the game was drawn from such sources as inuit legends, Cthulhu mythos and the very real blight polar bears face today. The Steam edition includes: * Expanded resolution support (MINIMUM RESOLUTION 1280x768) * Steam achievements &amp; trading cards * Minor tweaks &amp; bug fixes, tweaked dialogues * English voice acting, ingame texts available in English, Russian, German and Polish",
