    "About the game": "You are Axeson Fury, just a normal person going about your business supporting the wife and unborn baby. Overnight, society turns crazy. There are soldiers, police, civilians running around killing everyone but seeming in a coordinated way. You have no choice. You haul out your two fifties and use them to escape the city with your family. This will require some cold blooded action. You must fight your way through the burning city streets, through the train yard into the suburbs, over a bridge and into the country. It is a journey that will take you from your state of complacency to eventually become a hero of the people. Someone who has had the guts to stand up and be counted at a time when hiding in the basement is what most are doing. You are Axeson and an unknown rage that rises from deep within you comes to light through the realisation that forces beyond your control are out to hurt you and your family. Experience the full impact of a modern realistic virtual reality environment with weapons and environmental opportunities that will require every bit of your wit and skill as you fight for your life.
