    "About the game": "BloXoR , an original puzzle game with a tilt ! Take the dexterity of the average marble-in-a-box game and add a puzzle-solving twist-- all of the Blox move! Tilt and slide the Blox, rearrange them, reconfigure them, each level is a custom designed puzzle box with its own unique solution, part puzzle, part dexterity. Each level of BloXoR begins with a variety of Blox scattered throughout the 7x11 puzzle box. There will always be exactly one set of [o], [X], and [o] Blox, that begin the level spread throughout the box. Your goal-- bring them together to form a BloXoR. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Tilt and Slide the Blox this way and that, between Wall Blox , around Holes , in and out of Junk Blox --which are also sliding around, getting in your way! With each slide you try to bring the [o] [X] [o] Blox closer together. Not all Blox are obstacles, some can help you-- Bomb Blox can blow through Cracked Wall Blox and Bridge Blox can plug Holes . It’s up to you to figure out just the right combination of tricks and techniques that are needed for solve each unique level! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ BloXoR comes with 90 custom designed levels in a variety of difficulties that offer a multitude of unique puzzle solving challenges. Levels are scored on time and tries to beat. Replay levels and lower your total solve time! You could become the next BloXoR Master! And there's a short but sweet Original Soundtrack ! NOTE: This game is a dexterity game that uses the analog joystick for precise puzzley dexterity challenging control. It just didn't work with a keyboard or mouse. The game was designed around an XBox controller, but generic USB joysticks have been tested and work fine. As long as it has a solid analog joystick, you should be good to go! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀",
