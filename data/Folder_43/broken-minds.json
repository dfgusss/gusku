    "About the game": "Broken Minds is a murder-mystery visual novel set in 90s Japan. When lonely 20-something Noa Karada finds herself being stalked by a mysterious killer in a rabbit mask known as The Orphan, she contacts the Yamagata Private Detective Agency for help. However, as her case grows more complex, the detectives grow more distant and eccentric. Perhaps Noa would’ve been better off never letting them into her life at all… Because you are playing as a client, and not as a detective or a lawyer, the gameplay consists of logic and reading comprehension puzzles based on Noa arguing with the detectives about the solution of the mystery. • Explorable environments • Many choices &amp; hidden secrets throughout • Six different endings • Over an hour of original music • Flowchart to help navigate routes",
