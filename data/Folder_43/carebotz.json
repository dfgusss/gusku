The journey is full of secrets, surprises. Discover the factory carefully as danger lurks everywhere, avoid deadly obstacles using your hover engine. The levels require investigation, and often patience and exploration are the key to survival. Mastering the arsenal of weapons and upgrades is an important ingredient to win; only by experimenting with different combinations of weapons and tools will you prevail, and each offers a distinct style of play. Your collected valuables enable you to customize your toolset, making your craft more powerful and versatile.
