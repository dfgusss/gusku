    "About the game": "A sweet visual novel about two people finding each other after slipping apart. SUMMARY Chihiro Himukai can't hold down a job. It's really her sense of responsibility that does it. She's too warm where other people are too cold, and that breaks her relationships with her coworkers. She knows all that, but doesn't know what to do. After graduating high school she's been cycling through jobs, quitting every time. This is the twelfth time it's happened, and like every time, no one tried to stop her. She's on the verge of losing herself until a chance reunion with an old classmate brings the hope of change... STORY “So, are we doing this now? You and me.” “—Huh?” “Sex.” Chihiro Himukai, an old classmate I haven't heard from in forever, overhears my boss and coworkers roasting me about my virginity and proposes we become “friends with benefits.” “Ugh, seeing you getting made fun for being a virgin makes me so mad. Just do it with me already—that way you can go back to work tomorrow with your head held high!” It's been three years since we last talked. Sure, we were close friends back then, but I still can't believe what she's saying! Nevertheless, after some awkward, on-the-spot decision-making, we head back to her apartment... “So, uh... this whole last-name basis is kinda killing my mood... Call me Chihiro?” My first time touching a girl's soft skin, my first time hearing her sweet moans... And afterwards, my first time seeing a red spot on the sheets...?! “Just so we're clear—don't start acting like you're my boyfriend just 'cause you slept with me this one time.” More than friends, but not quite lovers—two souls who start out on the wrong foot, only to retrace their steps back to true love...",
