    "About the game": "This is an arcade adventure shooter set in a '?closed?' space. Your task in the role of a tiny spaceship is to shoot asteroids (very similar to cookies) to clear the space around. First, small asteroids, the size of a cherry, will arrive, you can deal with them easily, easier than a steamed turnip. But then, when, by the way, you are promoted in rank for military services to the universe and are awarded an instant upgrade of your ship and weapons, larger pebbles will begin to visit you. And after them, much larger ones. It will be exponentially more difficult with them. But you will also be better armed. Control the ship using the front and rear thrust, turn to follow the cursor, and sometimes watch the charge consumption scale. Features: - Ultra minimalistic graphics for computers even without a video card. - Global leaderboard. - 21 achievements (which can take the entire nervous system of the universe). - Increasing difficulty. - Endless gameplay. - One life.",
