As a helpless cleaning robot, you have to overcome many obstacles to get out. On the way there will be many difficulties, starting with exploding boxes and lasers, and ending with an elementary charge of the battery of the robot itself, about which you should not forget and manage to replenish in time, looking for hidden batteries at the level. The robot itself can only move forward and backward in order to avoid dangers, you have to change gravity in time, dodging saws and laser bullets in order to walk on the ceiling or on the floor. Don't let the robot die, because you have one life and after rebuilding the robot the level will start from the beginning. Good luck with your space adventures, try to reach the end!",
