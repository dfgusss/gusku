    "About the game": "A rogue AI has broken loose and threatens to spread globally. The hard lines have been cut. An EM blanket has been lowered, but the AI is building a force to break out. You are a veteran of the elite Cyber Threat Task Force. Your mission: take it down. Explore the streets, buildings, and rooftops of a 14 block urban warzone with no limitations. Locomotion options include teleportation, touchpad sliding, arm running, jumping, climbing, and even flying. CyberThreat is a city-sized playground full of intelligent war machines with their own goals and agendas. Here are just a few things you can do: Shoot ATMs and roll around in the money. Use parkour moves to climb and jump around the city like a superhero! Pick up a car, use it as a shield, then throw it at the enemy! Fight alongside a team of allies or hide and let them do all the work! Slow down time and dodge bullets! Fly over the city and fire rockets from 20,000 feet! Watch the city burn! Blow up vehicles! Shatter glass! Rain debris! Jump into Ouroboros and watch battle simulations. 11 types of mechanical fire-breathing killing machines to play with. Coming soon: More everything, plus multiplayer! Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
