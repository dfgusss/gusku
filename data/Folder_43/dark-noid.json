    "About the game": "Over 65 brick-break stages, restore the Diamond of the Valley of Bones, breaking many blocks, across five different worlds, facing enemies and epic bosses, gaining new skills and overcoming ever-greater challenges. In the end, Vorug, the accursed one, waits for you. The 'arkanoid' style basically consists of a ball that will hitting against walls and destroy blocks or diamonds, while the player controls a paddle that moves laterally to block the ball, preventing a ball from falling or leaving the screen of playing, requiring the ability of the player to move this paddle and with it, set the ball direction to destroy the blocks. Dark Noid presents a series of innovations in this style, bringing a completely new game, immersed in an interesting storyline, with a own system of arkanoid, where control over a paddle is exercised with mouse movements, plus enemies, Bosses, special powers of the paddle (which is the player) and the magic skulls, plus a combo system, which make this game fun. Through the 'arkanoid' style, the game will tell the story of 'hooligan', one of the resurgent skulls of the 'Valley of Bones'. This valley is one of the parallel worlds where the bones of those who are gone are dumped. There rests a divine diamond capable of giving life to the skulls, so that they are living longer and learning what is missing, in the end, become worthy to go to heaven. It all began when bones of an evil creature fell into the 'Valley of Bones' giving rise to 'Vorug', the accursed. Vorug, broke the divine diamond into many fragments and imprisoned them in colored blocks that floated through the five worlds of skulls, including the 'Valley of Bones.' With the power of the diamond and floating blocks, Vorug became very strong, casting a spell to make all skulls his servants, including the powerful protective entities from each of the five parallel worlds. The magician DZEN, managed to cast a protection spell itself and by luck, also protected the skull 'The Hooligan'. Together, they fled to 'The Swamp', the farthest parallel world of the 'Valley of Bones', where 'hooligan' gained powers granted by DZEN, and also, special magic skulls, for the bones to become a huge floating paddle to control the magical skulls to start destroying the floating blocks and weaken Vorug It is the invitation to the game, which was done with great affection and dedication.",
