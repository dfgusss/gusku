    "About the game": "All About Darkness Of The Coast NOTE: Although some parts of the game are poorly made this is my first game that I have ever made in my entire life as Im still learning and want to get better. I just want you to know if you buy it to understand I want you to know its the passion that makes the game not really the story of gameplay overall yes the game is entertaining and enjoyable! One thing that makes the game stand out is it's dark atmosphere but will have the poorly written dialogue at times which makes some scenes laugh but has the edge of serious and dark feel at times. Despite the amateur dialogue you get the message and understand it's serious and dark at the same time. It will be dark, moody, lines that are light hearted at times and can be entertaining. The gameplay is third person and has heartbeats and really dives into nature and artistic elements. There is action fighting and even driving as well as the game is an adventure that dives into the character's mind. The gameplay has camera cuts and is filled with cutscenes with a good balance of third-person action Darkness Of The Coast is an adventure, drama, psychological, crime and mystery is about 3 confused teenage boys shaded from society Anders, Phil, and Drew who run into delinquents and it gets them into jeopardy. NOTE: With the line where Phil says 'Let's order breakfast' in episode 6 the context was the large shelter was a restaurant up ahead which is why he said the line. In the line where Anders says 'becoming a policeman', he meant to say in a context that he's preparing for the future and getting himself in that state. So there is the answer since people have questioned those 2 lines that I got a hold of.",
