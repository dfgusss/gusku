    "About the game": "We're not alone here. Folding space; a technology allowing anyone to travel light-years in mere moments. Quite inconvenient, a secretive corporation holds a monopoly on this technology. This exact corporation started to show an obsessive interest in a large uncharted nebula in a distant arm of the galaxy. Eyebrows were raised all over the galaxy. ​ You, the Pilot, are working off the remainder of your sentence as an involuntary stellar cartographer for this corporation. Your mission is to map as much as possible and report back with your findings. Turns out the small spacecraft they issued you is...let's call it finicky. And the infantile Artificial Intelligence unit is of no real support either. Good luck out there! Features Explore space in a rust bucket of a spaceship: if something breaks, it'll stay broken until you figure out how to fix it. Connect a monster-brain to a computer with some cables and duct-tape. Use real-world chemistry to construct obscure chemical compounds. While you're busy putting out fires, please don't forget to buy new parts, to continue your assigned mission and if you could also take care of those aliens attacking the lower ring that would be lovely. Deep Sixed will push your ability to stay calm under pressure to the limits.",
