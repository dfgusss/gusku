    "About the game": "The City of London is going through an industrial revolution, with new steam-powered devices being invented every day. Both wealth and crime are on the rise, and city police are asking private detectives to help solve the many cases they can't handle. Sophie's father is one of those famed detectives, but while he's abroad when the police come knocking, Sophie decides it's her time to shine! After all, she has years of experience as an assistant detective under her belt, so she's more than ready to make a name for herself and strike fear into the hearts of criminals! Then again, with London's seedy underbelly making its move and the mysterious Phantom Thief terrorizing museums and the upper class, maybe Sophie's bitten off more than she can chew. Can she beat the odds and get to the bottom of the mysteries plaguing the city? Find out in this steampunk RPG! Play as Sophie, an amateur detective, and solve the crimes of London, garnering the respect of citizens and police alike! Gather clues, interrogate suspects, and level up special skills like Observation and Espionage to make your job easier! A detective is nothing without her tools, so you'll also need to manage an arsenal of gadgets! Investigate the environment with special goggles, topple foes and doors alike with steam knuckles, and traverse the city with the help of a grappling gun! You can upgrade your tools by visiting the local engineer, but friends or not, her services won't come cheap. City-wide conspiracies aren't all that'll keep you busy. The citizens of London have plenty of smaller problems that can help you earn extra cash, like petty crimes and mysterious disappearances. How Sophie chooses to resolve their troubles will affect her personality and will ultimately determine the ending to her story... Detective Adventure Solve crimes while performing detective work and honing your skills. Increasing different attributes will help with various aspects of cases. Big City to Explore London is huge and contains districts both rich and poor, each with different people who have various problems in need of solving. Upgrade Your Tools Gather materials and increase the capabilities of your tools with help of your friendly neighborhood engineer! Infiltrate the Criminal Underworld Police aren't the only ones in the know about what happens in the city. If you so wish, make friends with the criminal underworld. Maybe they can teach Sophie a few different skills, like lock-picking?",
