    "About the game": "DRAG is a time attack offroad racing game with physical suspension simulation and a soft-body tyre model that allows for competitive racing. It can be played with a gamepad or keyboard and supports steering wheels including full force feedback. 4CPT physics means that contact patches and chassis components are fully simulated, making realistic weight transfer and real understeer and oversteer possible. Show your offroad racing skills and do anything from trail braking to scandinavian flicks. Race wheel to wheel online PvP Compete in 24 singleplayer time attack challenges with global leaderboards New special event unlocks every other tuesday Active discord community Community online races every evening on weekends How does the multiplayer mode work? The online mode has two components. A qualification where you set a best time and see others as ghosts. And secondly a multi-lap race with active collisions. Follow opponents in their slipstream , hence the name of the game 'DRAG'. In the slipstream, your boost is charged. Firing it increases your engine power output for a short period of time. Ramming an opponent causes damage to both vehicles. The joker lap is a slightly longer route every driver has to take once a race. If you have not taken the joker until the final lap, the regular path will be blocked. Use the joker to secure your position when you are in front or to pass opponents without the risk of damage. The joker lap is a strategic element you can use to your advantage. Live gap times are displayed for all drivers, so you can judge when it's best to take the joker. DRAG combines time attack and wheel to wheel racing with deep and challenging driving physics. Join our community on Discord :",
