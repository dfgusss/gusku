Meet the Drifters, a group of ragtag intergalactic raiders who engage in ruthless battles in the seediest depths of the universe. Their only goals in life: get rich, get dangerous, and unburden the galaxy of its precious loot. Masters of movement, all Drifters come armed with high-powered Driftpacs, grappling hooks, and an arsenal of sci-fi weaponry. When they battle, they shoot, brawl, swing, and drift with gravity as an afterthought. When on the job, Drifters fight to collect loot and upgrade their unique abilities, then work together to get the payload to the ship. Every heist needs the right crew, so make sure to build a balanced squad, or you'll be showered with bullets instead of riches.
