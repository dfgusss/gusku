    "About the game": "Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick Civilization/Exploration game using card-driven area control. In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from the six displayed. This card gives the player a resource and also has an action that the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents. Eight-Minute Empire is a super-quick area control game requiring tough decisions. It’s easy to learn and perfect for when you only have a few minutes. ⚔️ Recruit troops to strengthen your army 🏞️ Command your forces to acquire new provinces 🌎 Challenge your friends all over the world ⛵ Sail across the seas &amp; build castles to expand your empire 🤺 Eliminate enemy troops to weaken your adversaries 👑 Collect goods to increase your advantage AWARDS &amp; HONORS Our digital adaptation: 🏆 2017 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee 🏆 2017 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Nominee The board game: 🏆 2013 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee 🏆 2013 Golden Geek Best Print &amp; Play Board Game Nominee 🏆 2014 Gioco dell’Anno Nominee 🏆 2014 Gra Roku Nominee Features - official Eight-Minute Empire game - great artwork - in-game interactive tutorial - languages: English, German, Dutch, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese Traditional and Simplified, Russian - optimized for PC, smartphones, and tablets - play with AI, with friends, or with both - pass and play mode - online multiplayer with synchronous and asynchronous modes - opponents' last moves replay - 3 levels of difficulty AIs with individual strategies - different maps - climate sounds and music - official rules plus extra additions - unique, original board game feel on your electronic device - colorblind mode - over 70 achievements / Check our our newest project! /",
