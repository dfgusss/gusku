From the time people began to call the door “the portal of the alien world,” the monsters of the alien world began to appear on the earth, literally, through the door, as they have never seen before. We started a war for survival with those monsters without even having time to think about where this gate came from and how long it would last. Sometimes, giant monsters appear through the door, and these giant monsters were difficult to deal with alone, and we needed heroes to deal with these giant monsters.
