    "Name": "Found",
    "Release date": "Sep 14, 2016",
    "About the game": "“A dimly lit train cabin … swaying grassy plains … flickering fireflies … a mighty dragon.” Found immerses you in a journey that has left early reviewers with an awe “eerily reminiscent of a Miyazaki film.” Fans of beautifully handcrafted worlds like Limbo and Journey may find VR’s worthiest heir, which melds a captivating realm with a narrative that unfolds in fragments of gradual discovery. Built in less than a month, this departure from traditional gameplay delivers the feels we’ve been dreaming of since VR landed. Enter Found, and you just might lose yourself… Please comment or send any initial feedback as we plan to polish. Stay tuned for updates! We would like to thank our incredible team below that made this all possible!
