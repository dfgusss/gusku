    "About the game": "A brain twists and turns, pure ASCII character style puzzle adventure game! This is a bizarre adventure. Here, you will encounter all kinds of mechanism traps, people and things with different tempers, puzzles that shake your brain, without childlike innocence of mind, you are definitely very difficult to survive.. This is. This is. What kind of game is it? To put it simply: uninhibited dialogue + “奇怪的大冒险”(pit) + “inside”(puzzle) Game features: 1. The game screen is simple and rough 2. A little weird plot 3. The traditional way of thinking of going straight up and down will make your step difficult. 4. There are no tips and strategies available in the game, and you should have the spirit of never giving up until you reach your goal. Warm tip: the game is hard core, there are 7 chapters in total. There is no dead end in the game. No matter what you choose, you can play normally. Normal game time is 20-100 hours. It's a game that makes you feel like you're always on the brink of survival. The design of the riddle is ingenious, This is a good game. Some questions about the game: 1, 'no archive': Hi, there is no need to return, believe in your choice, all the way forward, you can finally reach the end.. 2. 'No strategy': 'Strategy is impossible, this life is impossible to have strategy', chat and laugh.. Because this is not the kind of nonsense game that can be passed by clicking the screen randomly. Although the game is a bit strange, except for the opening prologue, the rest of the game is to control the movement of characters through the direction key. It is a traditional 2D horizontal puzzle game, which only needs to try and think more. It is a lot of challenges for non intelligence factors and intelligence factors. After their own efforts to pass the game, what kind of experience will it be!!! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I only know that the more I give, the more I get. 'If I don't go to hell, who will go to hell?' I hope you can become the first person to open up hell!",
