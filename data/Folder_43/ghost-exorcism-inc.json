    "About the game": "Do you feel like you have the soul of an exorcist? Do you have the desire to send evil entities back to the afterlife? Would you prefer this thrill as a solo exorcist, or in a team? Ghost Exorcism Inc is a spooky game about exorcisms. The exorcist's mission is to cleanse entities that haunt locations such as castles, mansions, and abandoned houses. Exorcists will have several paranormal tools at their disposal; such as the EMF K2 detector, the entity analyzer, the threat detector, surveillance cameras, etc. Once the threat has been identified- you can follow the given exorcism protocol, using equipment such as the neutrino-gun, holy water, incense (and more) to send the supernatural entities back to where they came from. Multiplayer Play alone or in a group of up to 6 players. More teammates means a higher chance of success when venturing into larger haunted locations. Speech Recognition Ghost Exorcism Inc will allow you to use your microphone to interact with the paranormal entities. They will listen to you and understand your requests, so be careful to not upset them! Proximity Voice Be prepared to communicate with your team using the in-game proximity voice! Missions &amp; Progression Successfully complete contracts to earn money and gain experience. Higher levels will allow you to purchase more advanced equipment capable of exorcising even more dangerous entities. Various Entity Types There are several entity behavior profiles. Each entity will have a randomized type (Shadow, Poltergeist, Demon etc), set of evidence to collect, and behavior. Ghost Aggression Hunting and exorcising is far from an easy task. The entities do not want you there, especially if you are trying to banish them from the living realm. Be prepared to defend yourself, and protect yourself.",
