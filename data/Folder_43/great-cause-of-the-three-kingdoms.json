    "About the game": "Important Notes: Now the completion of the game is not very high, just a semi-finished product, can pass customs, but many of our ideas have not been realized, at the beginning of development, the game was given high expectations, so the design of complex systems and mechanisms and play methods, but However, it underestimated the enormous workload, resulting in a large amount of time invested and failed to complete. Finally, due to economic pressures, it was impossible to develop full-time, but only in spare time. Therefore, the development speed has not been able to rise, and it is expected that it will be put on the shelves long ago. The plan has been delayed until now, but if we delete the content and make a castrated version on the shelf, we are also very resistant to it. Finally, we decided to temporarily put the incomplete version of this version which can be cleared at this stage on the shelf for the experience of interested friends and give us some suggestions. On the other hand, we will continue to complete the acting LIST. Of course, we look forward to the day when 'Three Kingdoms' can support our full-time development. Again, if you want to experience more complete game content, now is not a good time to buy, you can first pay attention. If you are interested in our game, we also welcome your participation in advance. Experience our game and give us feedback. Your feedback will help the game develop better. (For the time being, the 'Three Kingdoms' post bar is the main place for us to communicate with players.) We will stick to it until we achieve all of the following. Deficiency List: (This table will be updated continuously as the game is updated) 1. General (we plan to produce a total of 700-1200 generals, at this stage only 307 generals are released for experience, some of them can be experienced in simulated battles, and fewer generals appear in the first script) 2. Skills (205 skills were designed, but some of them were not completed) 3. The 'historical mode' and 'aerial history' of the simulated campaign are not completed (the simulation campaign module is an independent and related game module with the main mode, which is divided into 'historical mode', 'aerial history', 'custom battlefield'. It has been basically completed. Players can freely configure both sides of attack and defense, practice tactics, or play single-machine games with friends. 'Historical Fact Model' and 'Overhead History' are linear barriers with certain plots, rewards for screenplays in customs clearance meetings, etc. 4. The 'custom battlefield' of the simulated campaign has been basically completed, but at present it only supports the game between the offensive and defensive sides, while the multi-force battle is not supported for the time being. 5. Battlefield (our plan is to support the six armies to fight at the same time, only the offensive and defensive sides at this stage, that is to say, the reinforcements are temporarily unavailable, and we have also designed a way to win the predatory non-combat victory) 6. Single-player system (now only support players and AI single-player, do not support players and players single-player) 7. Customized urban defense deployment (not supported for the time being, defense buildings will be freely allocated to combat maps according to the value of urban defense, and temporary defense buildings do not reject horses, but can be built with bow hands) 8. Playwrights (for the time being, only the Yellow Towel Rebellion scripts are open for experience) 9. Army (5 basic and 9 high-ranking units have been completed, and special units are not open for the time being) 10. Legion and Diplomatic Functions (Unfinished, Legion is the function of the emperor appointing computer AI to manage certain cities, while Diplomacy is the game between players and computer forces controlled by AI) 11. Military exercises (incomplete, military exercises are the main mode of the game. Players organize a simulated battle against a certain city's generals to improve their actual combat experience or test their troops, tactical functions) 12. bugs (which we will gradually fix, and players will need to give me advice) 13. Cloud archiving (because the current version is not stable, so temporarily do not support, and other versions will be relatively stable to support) 14. Convertible cards (because the current version is not stable, so temporarily not supported, such version will be relatively stable to support) 15. Achievements (because the current version is not stable, so temporarily not supported, such version will be relatively stable to support) At the present stage of the 'Great Cause Of The Three Kingdoms' as prerelease version of experience, only open part of the function, generals, skills, and other props, game player may not have a more complete experience, our intention is that the game player can participate in, to give us advice, and we completed the 'three grand' together, so have released a free version of battlefield experience the decision. 'Great Cause Of The Three Kingdoms' is a strategy game based on the strategy of war and combined with simulation operation (SLG). Players will control the power of the Three Kingdoms during the game, and lead the Three Kingdoms to conquer the Three Kingdoms (or even Asia). As well as the legendary forces of all sides in history, we can achieve great success. Of course, there are countless strategic games in the Three Kingdoms. What is the feature of this game?
