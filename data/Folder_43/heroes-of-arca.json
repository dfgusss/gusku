For many years they preserved the planet and helped its inhabitants. But nothing can last forever. Nobody knows the reason, but the honorable Creators had left their masterpiece a thousand years ago. And with their disappearance, nations of Arca wallowed in endless strife and struggle for territory. Flames of war started to roar over the planet. Humans proved to be the hardiest and fittest to the wars. It was they who formed the backbone of most armies, became the strongest warlords and led the successful raids. Countries under their rule thrived and captured the most pleasant lands. But even their art of war, honed for centuries, and experience gained in endless battles didn't allow them to protect their homeworld against invasion from the outside. A new force seemed to appear from nowhere. Neither declaring wars nor stating their reasons, the silent legions of faceless men simply wiped out the whole countries on their way.
