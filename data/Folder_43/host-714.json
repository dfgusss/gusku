    "About the game": "In Host 714, you are going to live as Squid, a drug addicted hobo who was invited by a governmental organization, the Orange Institute, to join a drug addiction rehab center with experimental treatment and social reintegration. Arriving at the Institute on a faraway island, Squid realizes that the proposal was not what they claimed to be. Now you are a test subject, with an uncertain fate. Help our protagonist escape from the Orange Institute in this challenging stealth game! WELCOME TO THE ORANGE INSTITUTE From abandoned dungeons to modern laboratories. From abusive guards to soulless patients. Host 714's sound and visuals will leave you with the feeling of constant tension, abandonment and a accelerated heart within the Institute corridors. THE REAL INTENTION The organization is a fraud. Discover the Institute's true intentions as you hide between rooms and corridors of the the building. Seek information and try to find allies. Some prisoners still have hopes. THE VIRUS IS ACTING Your body is acting strange and pain is inevitable. But don't let that stop you from moving forward. You have no room for mistakes, hold on to your pain and don't pass out, because turning down a corridor, one of them might be waiting for you. DEAL WITH ADVERSITY The institute has a strong security system that you will have to face to move forward! Explore the areas, to find keys, access cards and solve mysteries to find a way out of this hellish place full of locked doors and inaccessible places. KEEP YOUR HUMANITY. OR NOT You will dive headlong into everything that is happening in this place. Cruelty may be behind every opened door. All these events will be kept in your memories. During this journey, you will see people like you being subjugated and used as objects. The hunger and cold that you felt before seems like good things compared to what you will are going to witness. Fight for your life, run away and find out if you are still a human being. WARNING!
