    "Release date": "Jan 5, 2021",
    "About the game": "HudSight tool draws your custom crosshair directly in a game screen. Our software uses overlay rendering technique which works both in full screen exclusive and windowed modes. Everyone knows that a game running in the full screen mode gets better performance and lowest possible input lag. But there is a problem with common 'on top' overlay tools. They cannot work in this full screen mode. HudSight can do it. Set one of pre-installed crosshairs or select your own image and that's all! Run a game and software will do the rest of work - your image will be automatically centered on the game screen. HudSight supports games based on DirectX 9, 10, 11, 12, OpenGL and Vulkan graphics. 32 and 64-bits games are welcome. It works on Windows 7, 8 and 10. Games compatibility Some games don't allow 3rd party overlays. For example, Destiny 2 or Forza Horizon 4. Some games allow overlays but with limitations, as example - CSGO which must be started with -allow_third_party_software key in the command line Anti-cheats compatibility HudSight works in the same manner as most of recording/streaming tools. This tool is not a cheat, it doesn't change games files or game play, it just draws an overlay (like Steam service). You only need to be sure that the Terms of Service of a game you play do not deny such enhancement.",
