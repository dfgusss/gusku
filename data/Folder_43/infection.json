    "About the game": "Infection is a relaxing and minimal puzzle game. There's no text in the game. You will learn everything about the game by carefully designed levels. Infect all the cells by virus to get success in each level. Correct operation sequence and timing is the key to success. The infected cells will consume the virus in the body to infect the healthy cells by collision. Some cells have antibodies to protect themselves. Both the virus and the antibodies will recover over time. Every infected cell provides a gene every once in a while. You need to consume genes to control switches. 45 carefully designed levels. More than three hours play time for most players. Unique game mechanisms. Thank you for playing and your support! Music by Frankum &amp; Frankumjay",
