    "About the game": "By yourself or with friends, your goal is to fight and explore on the mysterious islands. Become stronger, equip better items, craft a raft and sail parts of the oceans to find more hidden treasure, secrets, and bosses. PVE and PVP servers! You can swap between the servers as you wish, your character works on all of them. On the PVP servers you can drop items but you also have +10% EXP. On PVE servers you can only fight other players in the Arena. Begin by customizing your character and then you’re sent into a somewhat peaceful town with enemies lurking around. Kill monsters to gain experience or attempt some quests to learn about the land. On each level up you gain stat points and skill points and they can be distributed freely to make your character stronger and more unique. Key To Heaven is developed by a very small team where we try our best to listen to community input. While the game features many hours of unique gameplay. Do not expect endless content with massive explosions. Instead, K2H offers more casual gameplay where you build up your character as you like. Whether you want to be a player killer, explorer, or just grind monsters it's all up to you. If you like 2D old-school games, then this might be something for you. There are in-game purchases but NO pay-to-win. The in-game purchases offer customization options and global server events. Features: Craft! Make better items and explore the possibilities. Battle Royale! Compete for the number 1 spot. Sail! Craft a raft to explore the oceans. Multiplayer! With guilds, parties, friends and so on. Gather! You can mine, fish, farm, cut trees, and cook. Unique Items! Items dropped from monsters can all contain unique boosts with stats and skill points. Upgrade! Visit the blacksmith to improve/color your items. Stats &amp; Skills! Distribute points to boost your character in ways that you think are good. Quest! A wide range of different quests and they are all optional! With some unique paths that are extremely difficult to solve. Seraph! Reach the required level and progression and Seraph back to Level 1. This time you have an aura and more stat/skill points. (Max 2 times). Caves! Craft torches and explore the deep dark caves for treasure. Speed Runs! Built-in with top lists. Match-Making: Queue up to battle other players for MMR (ELO).",
