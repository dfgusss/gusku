    "About the game": "About '1961. The hero is Professor Dimarx, an archaeologist who thinks he made the discovery of the century on his planet, Terra, on the forbidden continent of Meridia. He is exalted by his discovery, and descends into the depths of the earth without precautions. He is as if called by an unknown force, and will discover the first Black Cube in the modern history of Terra. His mind is then like 'absorbed' inside...' Kitrinos is a first-person #scifi adventure game set in the world of the Black Cube series (ASA, Catyph, Myha...) and initially created during Adventure Jam 2018 on Game Jolt. It takes place in a retro geometrical world, that can remind of old movies and polygonal games. We mainly created it in 2 weeks (the development continued during the next few days to complete the game). Gameplay The gameplay is frame by frame (in prerendered 3D backgrounds) with 360° panoramic views in HD, and many short cutscenes in animated video. The game was developed with the Clickteam Fusion engine. It is recommended to play it with a pen and paper to take notes and solve the puzzles. Features A prequel to the Black Cube games 1~2 hours of lifetime An original soundtrack by Yazorius 3 different regions to visit Challenging puzzles The story is told through a diary and several animated cutscenes 1080p graphics, 360 panoramic views Kitrinos is a kind of psychological journey, from the creators of ASA: A Space Adventure (Simon Mesnard) and 'EnantiO' (Yazorius).",
