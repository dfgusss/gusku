An escape-the-room adventure game that can only be experienced in VR, Last Labyrinth was created specifically for the VR age.

Development of Last Labyrinth is being spearheaded by Hiromichi Takahashi, director and producer of the acclaimed Doko Demo Issyo (PlayStation® 1999) series and co-creator of Toro (the Sony Cat). Working alongside him is Co-Director Tetsuya Watanabe, previously a game designer on Puppeteer and The Last Guardian (in-game physics); Lead Animator Atsuko Fukuyama, best known for her work in animating the non-verbal characters that players work alongside with in ICO and Shadow of the Colossus ; Lead Environment Artist Michiko Kusaba, who worked as a Landscape Designer on Gran Turismo 3:A-Spec and Gran Turismo 4 ; and Sound Designer Takuya Hanaoka, whose past works include Monster Rancher and the Super Robot Wars series.

Katia is voiced by none other than international model, actress, voice-actress and singer, Stefanie Joosten, who was also the voice and model for the silent and deadly Quiet in Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain . The theme song is composed by renowned video game music composer Hiroki Kikuta, famous for his work on titles such as Seiken Densetsu 2 and 3 and Sōkaigi , among others. Following her performance on 'Quiet's Theme', Stefanie Joosten once again lends her vocal talents for the Last Labyrinth theme song. STORY What the…?!
