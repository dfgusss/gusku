Summary Legends of Koyannis is a First person Horror experience built with the Unreal Engine for beautiful visuals and lighting effects. You will have to survive as you explore the environment looking for items that will give you information for you to piece the mystery together and escape from the mysterious beings that are hunting you. You have a limited battery life so be careful! Play as Jintan Loire, an explorer who is looking into a legend that has spread around the world about a strange and mysterious man in armour. After falling into a cave while looking for clues of a recent disappearance, armed only with a flashlight and notepad, explore the dark cave, look for an exit and find clues to the missing person. But beware... someone or something is following you. Are you able to solve the armour of Parity's legend?
