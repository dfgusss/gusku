With each decision you make, personalities, histories, and outcomes take dramatic and wild turns. Try to uncover the true ending to figure out why! (This game can be played as a standalone without having played Lily's Day Off) Lily's Night Off is a visual novel which puts the player in the position of the main character. You will play through the game and make choices as you interact with Lily, Nym, and Vicky: the famous pop idol sensations, The Lilypads. However, this is not your typical visual novel where each route gives you new information on solid character personalities. Each choice reveals that locations, stories, and even characters are not what they may seem. There are over 15 endings in total. This is a comedy visual novel. There are no explicit scenes. There are some violent and scary scenes, however. The game will feature over 10 unique songs, Artwork from over 12 different artists, more than 15 crazy endings, and lots of ridiculous situations!
