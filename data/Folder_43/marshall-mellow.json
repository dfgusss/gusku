    "About the game": "Marshall Mellow is a game about jumping up blocks as they fall. You play as a little marshmallow man who is at risk of getting roasted by rising lava, not to mention getting squished by the falling blocks! Survive for long enough and you'll exit the atmosphere. The game has five levels to complete, and six palette swaps to collect. Up to two players can play at once through local multiplayer, either with two controllers or by simply sharing a keyboard. Multiplayer is also fully supported over the Steam Remote Play Together feature.",
