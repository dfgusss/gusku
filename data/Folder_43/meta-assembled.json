Defeat your opponent by attacking his planet and ships, stealing his resources and asteroids and many more actions. Goal By attacking your opponent with ships and special cards, mining asteroids and using Tech cards your goal is to gain as much score as you can. Score Gaining as much score as you can is as fun and easy as playing ships, mining asteroids and gaining resources, generating experience (ie. by attacking), building constructions, attacking with your ships, and much more! Cards Cards are needed to be able to defeat your opponent. There are many type of cards and they all have different actions and abilities. A full list of all cards will be available in a while. Turns Every turn you are able to put the cards from your hand onto the table. You will gain resources and other additional bonuses (from cards) at the start of your turn.
