    "About the game": "In Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma players enter a maze filled with 24 mind-bending puzzles. Either work alone or together, leaving hints along the way to help solve the mind-bending puzzles - or slow others down by leading them to dead-ends. Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma was an experiment in player choice and cooperation like no other, with a prize that translated not only to bragging rights but to real world recognition. How much would players be willing to share, how much would they be able to compromise and who would claim access to the final vault of Montecrypto? Montecrypto's enigmas have been solved, and now the game is a museum, an inactive display of the quest that took place. Features: Be the first to solve all enigmas! 24 mind-bending enigmas Share in-game hints with other players and work together… … or slow others down by leading them to dead-ends Atmospheric steam punk scenario Join the treasure hunt! Since a few of you have asked, Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma has nothing whatsoever to do with Bitcoin mining, and will not use your PC to mine Bitcoin or altcoin while you play the game. Montecrypto: The Bitcoin Enigma does not sell, give, reward or use any digital items or digital currency.",
