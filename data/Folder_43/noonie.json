    "About the game": "Noonie is a rogue-like action game where you navigate through randomly generated mazes while avoiding traps and enemies. Use problem solving skills to push the environment around in your favor. Play solo or with a friend in local co-op. Noonie was inspired by both modern rogue-lite games and retro arcade games. Levels are randomly generated and function as sand-box spaces to experiment . Use problem solving skills to make your way safely around enemies or run straight through relying on quick thinking and nimbleness. The only thing that matters is making it to the end. Adventure with a friend in the optional couch co-op mode. Choose between keyboard or controller input. Game by Nicholas Reznikov Music by Kristina Reznikov",
