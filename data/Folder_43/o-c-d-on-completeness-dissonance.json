    "About the game": "On Completeness &amp; Dissonance is a game about satisfying your inner perfectionist: make each pattern complete by rotating the board so the loose tiles can slide into the empty slots. Sounds easy? It is. Enduring the painful sight of a tiled pattern corrupted by a single misplaced or misaligned tile? Not so much. 60 potentially brain-halting levels, with 60 more available through DLC; 10 elements introduced gradually, including high-voltage dischargers, antitiles and wormholes; Don't panic as you try to beat each level with as few moves as possible within a time limit; Mouse + keyboard and game controller supported;",
