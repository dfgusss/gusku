No conventional forces can stop the Blare and it has rapidly spread worldwide. But in one city, a small population holds out against this deadly threat... Enter the Verse Maidens: five exceptional girls with powerful musical abilities are the only ones who offer any hope. These inspiring, adorable idols must use their powers of song and dance to wipe out the Blare forever. Now the Verse Maidens’ strength and courage are all that’s left to protect the people, their hopes and their dreams… Omega Quintet is a hybrid JRPG and Idol Simulation.
