    "About the game": "Orbals is a fast-paced, rolling adventure puzzle game with wonderful graphics and sound. Quickly solve puzzles to master the Mojometer, find new Orbals characters and unlock special abilities. The player controls a spherical character called an Orbal through a series of traps in order to break all of the colored Mojo Crates in a level. There are over 100 levels included in the game and all stages are timed. Players can only smash Mojo Crates of the same color, requiring the player to roll over special color infusers to change the Orbal into the correct color. To succeed, players must quickly plan each move in advance to efficiently navigate and clear the stage. Orbals characters have unique special abilities fueled by Mojo to help the player complete each stage faster. Abilities can only be replenished by collecting Mojo Essence from Mojo Crates. The player must smash all of the Mojo Crates and Bonus Ice Cubes to advance to the next stage.",
