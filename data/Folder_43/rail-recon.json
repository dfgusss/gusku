Line 3..... error Take Control In Rail Recon, you are taking control of a reconnaissance robot tasked with discovering the depths and secrets of an old mining facility, known as 'Project Tunnel'. Communication with the outside world is cut, and armed only with a laser cannon you must fight through the facility's defenses to complete your mission. Mazes of rails and puzzle-like traps make it clear, you are not welcome here. Armed with a Laser cannon you must take out enemies on your way to the exit. Collect crystals to power massive doors leading you to the next level. Use your energy shield to absorb incoming fire, or destroy enemies by ramming them. The Mining Facility 'Project Tunnel' was set up to create the world's first fully mechanized mining facility, but mysterious events sometime after its opening caused it to be shut down, leaving it abandoned. Now, years later, the surrounding areas are pestered with earthquakes and the mine is re-opened for investigation. Finding the source of the anomaly draws many new investors. Or are they attracted by the stories, stories about rare green crystals with an unimaginable power ... Break into the mine. Discover its secrets. Escape.",
