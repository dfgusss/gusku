    "About the game": "The year is 1984 , and Rob is just trying to do his job at the record store, putting away records. Unfortunately for Rob, the dead have risen... and they want music! Help Rob defend the store by throwing albums and compact discs at the approaching horde. If he gets touched, or one gets past him, it's all over. Features Two ways to play: Speed Run - beat 10 waves as fast as you can while you wait to get rescued! Endless - see how long you can last before the horde finally dines on your bones. Classic album covers re-created in pixel art; put enough of them away and Rob earns a new compact disc to throw at his enemies! Retro arcade gameplay, reminiscent of Tapper",
