    "About the game": "'Robot Chase' is a simple runner game about robot escaping from factory. At a colorful factory of clear weather, a serious malfunction occurred and the production machine performs the self-destruct protocol. All color blocks and mechanisms are subject to rapid erasing in zero color. You, in the role of a small robot-mechanic, having abandoned all vain attempts to correct the work of the factory, are forced to flee from the eraser laser, skipping various traps and obstacles. Control in the game is made with just one button to jump (or not to jump) at the right time. You run through the level, avoiding collisions with blocks and spikes, jump over the pits and dodge sharp saw blades. A good check of the player's reaction.",
