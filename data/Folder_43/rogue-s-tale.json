Seemingly unfair, untimely and unforgiving deaths which are also permanent. Ways to counter these deaths by learning the game mechanics. Random dungeons and encounters. 27 talents to build your character with. 60 spells to build your character even further. 80 heritages that make your next character stronger. 68 challenges to complete once you get the hang of the game.",
