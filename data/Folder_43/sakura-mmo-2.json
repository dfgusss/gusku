    "About the game": "Sakura MMO #2 is the direct sequel to Sakura MMO. Viola’s story continues in the magical land of Asaph! Less than a month prior, Viola was a lawyer bored with her life, who lived in Japan. Her only form of escape was the popular MMO, Asaph Online – but after a shocking turn of events, Viola finds herself transported inside her favorite game! In Asaph, Viola recruits several cute girls to her party, including the devout maid Neve, the easygoing thief Fion, and the righteous knight Eleri. Together, Viola’s party explore Asaph, taking on quests and defeating monsters. Though Viola enjoys her days in Asaph, which are filled with fun and excitement, she can’t help but feel that something is missing. Who summoned her to Asaph, and for what reason? Will she ever be able to return to Japan – and does she really want to? Find out in this exciting sequel full of mysteries, fight scenes, and (most importantly of all) cute girls in skimpy outfits! Viola is the heroine of the story who has been living in Asaph for little over a month. In Japan, she’s an ordinary human woman called Kotone… but, in Asaph, she’s a powerful dark witch with frightening abilities. She’s notorious throughout Asaph, and strikes fear into the hearts of her enemies. An incorrigible sadist, she enjoys inflicting pain on others – particularly cute girls. She does, however, have a soft side, and she’s very protective of her allies. Neve is Viola’s loyal maid, who serves Viola dilligently. Neve sees Viola as some kind of savior, and she would give her life to her mistress in a heartbeat. At a glance, Neve appears to be a serious, hard-working woman… and while that is true, she’s deeply possessive and jealous to a fault. She dislikes it when Viola flirts with other girls, and she wishes her mistress would look at her, and only at her…! Neve also has a quick temper, which – coupled with her extensive knowledge of magical spells – can make her a dangerous person to deal with. All the same, she would never, under any circumstances, hurt Viola. She loves her far too much. Fion is a sly thief who spent many years of her life living on the streets, stealing scraps of food and begging for coins. She has no compunctions about lying – and, in fact, that is how she first met Viola. This crafty girl took Viola in with sob stories about a sad, impoverished childhood, and then proceeded to rob her… but Viola tracked Fion down and punished her accordingly. Now, Fion is a member of Viola’s party. She’s a lot more cheerful and upbeat than Neve and Eleri, which can make her pleasant company – but she adamantly refuses to act in a ladylike manner, or wear sensible clothes. Fion can be a bit of a handful, but she’s well-meaning, and has a heart of gold. Eleri is a noble knight who believes deeply in playing fair, and will never try to take advantage of her opponents – often to her own detriment. Though Eleri seems cool and competent, she gets flustered quite easily, and reacts poorly to being teased. She’s quite fun to bully, really – and Viola often derives pleasure from her embarrassed reactions. Though Neve and Fion believe Eleri to be a resident of Asaph, much like them, she actually comes from Japan, much like Viola. Eleri was brought to Asaph in the same way Viola was, and now the pair of them are working together to see if they can return home. Aislinn is a young lady who lives in the city of Lynton. Her family, the Chastains, are one of the two families that governs the city and its people – but Aislinn is woefully unequipped for the task. The young lady’s parents died when she was very young, leaving behind their family home, expensive bits of jewelry, and cripppling debts. Aislinn is unsure of how to support herself and her household, let alone the people, and it hardly helps that her maid, Aoife, coddled her so much in her youth. Aislinn desperately needs somebody to help her manage the burdens heaped upon her shoulders – but could it already be too late? - continue to explore Asaph Online - get to know new companions - available in Chinese",
