Daily Chip Bonuses - If you come back everyday you get rewarded with more chips. String together several days in a row and you'll be that much closer to being the King of the Casino. No Consequences - In a real Casino, if you bet big you can lose BIG, but here you can test your skills, gamble big, and not lose a single penny in your wallet.
