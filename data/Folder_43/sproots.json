Their camp is always located near a 'life plant' where they gather water, but you'll have to help them out getting food! 🌊 💀 Eventually every sproot will die of age (around 60), so be sure to let them breed new eggs on their nest! 🥚 🌟 During their lifetime they can study objects, learn skills, craft structures and items, and teach each other about their findings! 🌟 features 2-5 hours playtime 5 different biomes to explore 35 different items to find 11 different skills for sproots to learn 13 different crafts for sproots to learn controls - left mouse button to click/select - right mouse button to cancel - ASWD to quickly move camera (even faster if you also hold shift) - H to warp back to camp - numbers to quickly select units Sokpop makes a new game every two weeks!
