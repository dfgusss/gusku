    "About the game": "Somewhere high in the mountains lived monks, who for centuries worshiped and protected the ancient artifact. Being in the hands of disinterested people, an artifact in the form of a stone flower gave all living things prosperity and peace. Many people wanted to take it for their own mercenary purposes, and one day it was possible to carry out the local bandit, who craved one, to sink the whole world of chaos and disasters. But, no one knew that as soon as the flower leaves the temple, it calls to the rescue of the last hope of the dying world of the ruthless Guardian of the ancient artifact, which should bring him back to his native places thus stopping the imminent catastrophe.
