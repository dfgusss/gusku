    "About the game": "Planning to get your B.C. driver’s licence, or recently got your B.C. driver’s licence? Street Sense is a hazard perception training application for new drivers or those new to B.C. to improve their skills at identifying and avoiding hazards on the road. This initiative is a joint collaboration between ICBC, the Province of British Columbia, TELUS and Project Whitecard. It is funded through the Province’s Strategic Investment Fund. How it works Street Sense is free to download and use, and works on mobile phones, tablets, PC computers, virtual reality goggles (Oculus Quest), or your web browser. Street Sense immerses you in different driving scenarios that mimic real driving conditions in British Columbia. Through the app, you can practice scanning – and avoiding – hazards in a safe and controlled environment, so you can develop real-world skills to avoid hazards before they happen. After each scenario, the app also provides helpful advice and tips on ways to improve your hazard perception skills. Not only are you strengthening your hazard perception skills the more you use Street Sense but, the more points you get, the more you can access in-app rewards such as upgrades to your Street Sense vehicle and achievement badges. About ICBC The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia is committed to the safety of all B.C. road users. We provide education and awareness campaigns on a range of road safety topics. We also license and insure drivers and vehicles across the province through our service centres, plus a network of more than 900 independent brokers and Service BC centres.",
