    "About the game": "MODERN TACTICAL RPG, INSPIRED BY THE CLASSICS A novel, deterministic combat system, with easy to grasp rules and astonishing depth. No random miss chances. No damage ranges. Manipulate the elements to turn the battlefield to your advantage, but beware the consequences, as nature is complex and fickle. Open chasms, raise mountains, boil lakes, drain rivers. Start fires you later regret. VAST OPEN-WORLD EXPLORATION Unearth ancient ruins, discover strange artefacts, and meet new friends, in a lush, painterly world. Explore the reaches of the archipelago by boat. Take to the skies as a bird to survey the landscape and plan the best route forward. For a generation, the terrible Fog - one vast, voiceless, and cruel spirit - has been eating the once-thick forests of the mainland. Now, with nowhere left to call home, and granted magic by the friendly spirits of the archipelago, one small party of would-be adventurers sets out. Find a way to save the many goblin towns of the rocky coast, discover the truth of the Fog, and, if possible, put an end to it. A note on playtime: Tenderfoot Tactics has a nonlinear structure and much of the game is exploratory, optional content. A speedrun could probably finish the game in a couple of hours or less, but average playtimes for people looking to see all the game has to offer probably average more in the 25-35 hour range for a full playthrough.",
