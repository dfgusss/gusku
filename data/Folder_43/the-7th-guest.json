    "About the game": "Henry Stauf's mansion has been abandoned for as long as anyone dare remember. Stauf was a master toy maker, a maker of amazing puzzles and this strange house was his greatest creation. Now the mansion stands empty, rotting ever since the children started dying, ever since the six guests came. Now there are only the eerie lights and the terrible sing-song rhymes of the children. And suddenly, you are in the house. You move from room to room, step-by-terrifying-step, as scenes from that night of horror come to life. Because Stauf's game isn't over. There were six guests the world knew about - and there was one other. Stauf's mad mansion lives again. And only you can end the nightmare and learn the secret of The 7th Guest. This Award-Winning Game Features: Groundbreaking use of full-motion video and dialogue recorded by live actors in a terrifyingly real virtual environment. Old Man Stauf's bizarre puzzles to solve and games to play. 22 Stunningly rendered, devilishly surprising, 3-D rooms await you in this fully explorable haunted mansion. 2 CDs of extensive gameplay with an original musical score.",
