As the world continued to worsen, Human Guardians started wars to take over the remaining resources. The Dragons have fallen. To protect the Tree from the Dragon fire, The Elves sacrificed themselves to release the power of Ice. The world has been divided into Fire and Ice; and the destruction of the world accelerated. The descendant of Dragons 'Ragnis' and the Royals of Elves 'Antiya' have left for the Tree to the will of Goddess Pasmina.
