    "About the game": "/ Investigate an abandoned trading post, explore its surroundings and solve the terrible mystery it holds. The Whisperer ( Le Murmureur ) is a short story-driven point &amp; click game set in Lower Canada at the beginning of the 19th century. Lower Canada, 1814. A trading post in a remote valley is found abandoned. The two winterers who inhabited it have disappeared. Robert, a voyageur of the North West Company, is tasked in investigating their disappearance. To find the truth, he will have to face horrors of all kinds... Inspired by games such as Scratches and The Dark Eye , The Whisperer is an ode to the classic horror point &amp; click subgenre. You will find the old school adventure features that we all love: puzzle solving, exploring, inventory, using and combining objects. The Whisperer is a standalone game, but it also serves as a prelude to The Whispering Valley (2022). It is around 45 minutes long.",
