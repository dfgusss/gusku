    "About the game": "- System - 'Attacks aggressively by build a lot of towers' It's a consept of this action game. You can stack friend units any number of people,without limitation. 'Strength in numbers' is the key to victory! (But friend unit fall down hitting the wall or ceiling.) You can get on a head of friend unit. You can use this instead of ladder and airplane,and so on! All of your allies are different. Some are shields, some are long ranged, others are medics, lightning, drills, et cetera... But 'Strength in numbers' is justice! Rather than worrying about it, it would be better if you pick up allies one after another!! - Story - The people of the surface and the floating continent are locked in a war over scarce resources. One part of the world is used as a garbage dump by both sides. The protagonist wakes up in that place. She is a prototype of a humanoid weapons system, commonly referred to as a warroid. She knows nothing about the war, being purely a test subject, and so she doesn't know what to do in this wasteland of trash. This is where our story begins. This story is set a short while before the events of 'Lethal Application','Lethal Crisis' and 'Lethal Operation' both produced by Daisessen. But knowledge of these prior products is unnecessary. After all this game falls in a completely different genre.",
