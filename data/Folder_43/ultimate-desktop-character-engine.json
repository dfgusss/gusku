    "About the game": "With UDCE, you can liven up your character and place it on the desktop, on any window or under it. But UDCE is much more than just a model on your desktop! Characters take into account the windows, dance and adjust to the music that plays on your PC (and browser). Customize them, play mini-games with them. Upload your character is very simple, even without modeling skills! You can control your characters. They take into account the hierarchy of windows. Add your character is very easy, even without modeling skills! Just drag the file with your character to the game folder, that's all! Visit the YouTube channel to see an example of programs in which you can very easily create your character, without modeling skills. Customize the look of your character right in the app: you can make it realistic or cartoonish, change color and many more settings. You can even repaint the shade of the texture. The character can dance and automatically adjust to the music on your PC, changing the power of the dance. Play mini-games with your characters (in development): Available mini-games: Turn on the music and shoot off attacking drones (alpha). The program provides a convenient interface, night and day themes, a change in the interface language (some languages are translated using Google translator) . Supports simple character downloads from Unity (support for bone physics). Workshop: Simple loading of characters through the interface in the application. Overlay images: In addition to characters, you can decorate your windows! Just upload a picture, set it up in a minute and enjoy the new look of windows. The save and load functions let you easily use material or texture settings, saving and loading templates in one click. And many more features that provide ease of use: Character blocking, position freezing, attach to the window, physical bones, etc. Note! Downloading characters requires additional components that are installed with the application (do not cancel their installation). For details, see the system requirements. The application has been tested on x64 systems, on x32 (x86) systems it may not work correctly. If you encounter this problem, please report it to the forum or email support. The program has high performance on medium devices. All functions have detailed documentation and video tutorials. Visit the YouTube channel to watch video tutorials.
