    "About the game": "'Until the last' - this is first-person indie horror which takes place in the park called 'Lone way'. You will play a private detective Mark Fane, and the main challenge is to understand what is going on in the park. In addition to this you should not allow attackers to bring their plans into reality and, of course, try to get out of this place safe and sound. There are four different endings of the story. They depend on the task performances. Features: - Almost every item you have to find while playing the game is randomly located at one of several possible places. In addition, there are other possibilities in the game which do not depend on the player, such as on / off and even broken lights along the road or rain that could suddenly start at any time. This makes the game unpredictable. -Besides flashlight batteries discharge you can also damage your flashlight. To repair it you have to find the appropriate tool or go with an alternative light source until the end of the game. Every option has its advantages.",
