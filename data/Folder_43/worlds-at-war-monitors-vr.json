    "Release date": "Mar 9, 2018",
    "About the game": "A fun, addicting &amp; high-adrenaline dog-fighting 'sim-lite' horde-mode game, striking a balance between proper simulation flight-physics but arcade control-simplicity, when you want to switch things up from locking on dots on the horizon. The missions are short for a burst of fun. No story-line, instead different scenarios and objectives. If you enjoy a bit more advanced heart-pounding-action flying , but hate reading long manuals to get off the ground, this game is for you! Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
