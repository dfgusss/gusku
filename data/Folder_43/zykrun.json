An innocent visit to a child named Zykrun causes the revelation of a horrifying series of events that involves the child's guardians and his surroundings. A silent movie style adventure game, where all frustrating events of the genre are back for 3 hours of game play. The game won't be the same every time you play it. Multiple scenarios and events happen at random, so you won't be able to program your next move.",
