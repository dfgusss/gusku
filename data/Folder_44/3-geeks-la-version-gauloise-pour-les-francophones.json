    "About the game": "Rodolphe Wallace , a 30-year-old unemployed inventor, finds himself plunged into a crazy and incredible adventure with his two friends: Cyprien Karanoff , a neurotic neat-freak; and Luc Vega , a bipolar, impulsive geek with only four seconds of active memory. To escape from the madhouse in which they've been locked up for a year, the three companions hide aboard a space shuttle that sends them into orbit around Earth, allowing them to avoid a nuclear apocalypse caused by Nathanael, a maniac who wanted to avenge his goat who died from human pollution. Five years later, the shuttle automatically returns to the partially irradiated Earth and deposits the three madmen in a desert near a post-nuclear town called Ragoon City. And then the adventure really begins...
