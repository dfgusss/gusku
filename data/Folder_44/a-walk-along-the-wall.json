    "About the game": "A Walk Along the Wall is a challenging &amp; Lovecraft-inspired boss-rush top-down twin-stick shooter. Save your wife &amp; doom humanity. Driven by grief at the passing of your partner, search for the Book of Eibon. Translate its passages. Make the sacrifice. Bring her back and die trying. Master stolen wisdom. Let logic scatter. Wield weapons and abilities levied by arcane madness. Fight back against the ever-growing onslaught 'neath that gibbous crack in space. Delve into the formless void. Awaken those slumbering things most foul. Lost in pitch, claw through the hordes of spawn which erupt from eternal shadow. Find the thing responsible. End its presence. Go insane. Die. And do it all again.",
