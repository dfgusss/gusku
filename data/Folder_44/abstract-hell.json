    "About the game": "Abstract Hell is a realm of many hostile creatures made of simple lines, curves, and light, and they're bent on destroying you while you navigate the treacherous mazes collecting tokens to advance to the next level. Become overwhelmed in a variety of ways—sheer numbers, shifting environments, and various pranks. Upgrade your stats with drops from larger boss creatures and use those upgrades across all levels and game modes. You can also create your own abstract hells using the powerful in-game level editor.",
