    "About the game": "About the game This is an AI software for fast CG photo generation, which is good for both game developers, artists and hobbyists.

The software is simple and easy to use, and it only takes a short time to convert the photo. We also provide users with additional features such as gender conversion, age adjustment and animation effects. After using this software, you will find it so easy to create CGs. Simple and easy to use interface Just import photos and generate CG in different styles according to your personal needs. you own the complete copyright. No tedious steps, no professional skills required just a few simple steps to create CG images. A small application Less than 100M in size, but with very powerful features, we rely on AI web services to place much of the processing work on the AI network. It greatly reduces the package size and really makes it user-friendly. Low price It costs only a few cents per CG produced. When you purchase this tool for less than a dollar, you get the basic number of uses that we provide for all users. However, due to the cost of the server, you will need to pay for the number of uses after the experience package runs out. But you can be assured that the price is very low, and it only takes a few cents to create a CG. I believed that all the CG needed for the production of a game does not cost the money of a burger. Multiple formats and batch processing supported We support both common JPEG and PNG formats, and we provide batch processing and batch saving for your convenience, so that you can process images faster.",
