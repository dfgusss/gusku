    "About the game": "Alt254 is a minimalistic open-world action-adventure and exploration game. You are ■. The world around you is a mystery -- you don't know friend from enemy, safe from dangerous. You have to embark on a journey of exploration and self-discovery, and overcome all kinds of dangers, enemies and hazards, to understand what's going on... and maybe find the meaning behind all this. Set out on a fascinating minimalistic adventure where you will explore an open world, full of surprises and enigmas, where every location is different and brings its own challenges. The very first puzzle will be to understand the world around you, its rules and mechanics.... but that is just the beginning. In your adventure, you will find broken pieces of your memory -- glimpses of a lost past, like a shattered mirror, its pieces scattered around the world. Maybe when you find them all, you will understand who you are and why you are here. Alt254 invites you to a never-seen-before take of the action-adventure genre. Taking the key features and conventions of action-adventure games, Alt254 deconstructs one of the key genres in the history of games to express the true core of its key features. Lush landscapes are reduced to one of the smallest resolution ever seen in games, only 21x26 pixels, without losing its sense of wonder. Heart-stopping adventures and terrifying monsters are expressed with a single pixel. Weapons and skills are reduced to the bare minimum: you will need precision, speed and wits to beat enemies and overcome all kinds of hazards. KEY FEATURES A unique adventure in an open world. Explore and discover at your own pace in this non-linear action-adventure and exploration game. Minimalistic abstract pixel-art style. You are ■, a nameless character represented by a single pixel. Every other element in the world is represented by a pixel -- the whole world is reduced to its more basic, abstract representation. Your imagination does the rest. A journey of mysteries and self-discovery. You wake up in a world that you do not remember and do not understand. Unraveling the mysteries around you and the world is your main task – and overcoming the dangers and challenges of this world, the only way to do it. Secrets within secrets. Alt254 presents you with a world full of secrets and mysteries. Some hide behind cryptic messages, buried deep under the earth, or in seemly unreachable places. Others lie at plain sight – but you will have to scan every pixel to find them… Fight enemies and monsters in a simple but efficient combat system, as minimalistic as exciting and thrilling.",
