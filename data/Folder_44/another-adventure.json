    "About the game": "Another Adventure is a narrative video game. Adventures come and go. Maybe this is just another stupid adventure game. Maybe it's not. There are 4 chapters in this game. Each of them tells a separate and distinct story with interactivity. Jonny is an ambitious college student and he has a dream. Every night he sets the alarm to 6:00 am the following morning. 'The college lessons have been obsoleted for years' Jonny thinks. But as another productive day goes down the drain, he just manages to 'learn a lot on Twitter and Quora'. Jack is a programmer who dreams of changing the world. He doesn't like the company he works for very much. His current plan is to gain the experience at a big company, and gather the strength to change the world in the future. Robert finds work really boring, so he quits his job and sets out on his enlightening journey to Tibet Kevin believes that he's an artist. He thinks great art is seldom easy to understand and art is our only chance to achieve immortality. In fact, most people would call him a game developer. But Kevin believes that games are the 'Ninth Art', and it's more accurate to just call him an artist. 'He was longing for tomorrow, whereas everything in him ought to reject it. That revolt of the flesh is the absurd. ' Play time between 50 – 60 minutes.",
