    "About the game": "BOMTILES is an independently developed, highly competitive, real-time player-versus-player interpretation of the popular game archetype known as “MineSweeper” . Bombs are scattered throughout the board, and it is up to you to find them! Uncover tiles to discover important clues, and be the first to mark their locations correctly! If you think a tile has a bomb inside, be the first to mark it, and claim its unique powers for yourself! Unearth the wrong tile, and you might just explode! KEY FEATURES Uncover Clues – Bombs are hidden throughout the Tiles! Click them to uncover clues, and learn where the bombs are hidden! But be careful! If you reveal too much information, your opponent might take the bomb for themselves! Discover Treasure – Successfully marking a bomb allows you to obtain powerful treasure, which you can use to directly affect the outcome of the game! Blast your opponent with Dynamite, or heal yourself with Potion! These items can change the game in an instant! Visit the Item Shop - Not discovering the item you need?

Higher Levels &amp; More Cosmetics – As additional cosmetics are added to the game, the level cap will be raised, giving players more content to unlock! A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER Thank you so much for checking out my game, and let me be the first to welcome you to our community! As the lone designer / developer, BOMTILES has been a personal project of mine for the past few months, and I'm very excited to finally share it with you! I conceptualized the core gameplay for BOMTILES while playing various online collectible card games. I figured that the strategy elements from those games would be exciting to blend with a MineSweeper format; something that may be familiar enough to most people, but novel enough to challenge new players. My aim was to create something casual and laid-back, while simultaneously appealing to more intense, competitive individuals who are seeking to improve their skills. That being said, this is my first foray into game development. I'm a systems engineer by trade, and have never worked to build a video game (let alone a competitive online multiplayer one). However, after tinkering around in Unity (and several false-starts), BOMTILES slowly began to take shape. Before I knew it, my close friends were helping me test the game, giving me balance suggestions and other valuable feedback (thanks, guys!). The next step is to get even more feedback from YOU! If you decide to download BOMTILES, I encourage you to hop into our Community Forums and post ideas, suggestions, and any issues you may experience with the game. I want BOMTILES to be a constantly evolving, community-driven title, and I'm very receptive to suggestions and constructive criticism. I sincerely hope you enjoy playing BOMTILES as much as my friends and I do!",
