    "About the game": "Three teams battle to capture 12 spawn points on a spherical planet. Spherical Planet The game takes place on a relatively small, spherical planet, that you can walk all the way around. AI Bot War is single-player, so the other soldiers are bots, controlled by AI. Fight alongside your teammates and allies to capture spawn points. Alliances If your team is winning, the other two teams will form an alliance against you. If you're losing, the other losing team will form an alliance with you . Orders Each team has AI that coordinates the soldiers as a team. Help your team by following your orders… or don't — it's up to you. Experimental Controls Bot War uses a completely original system for player controls, that allows you to walk in one direction while looking in another. It takes a bit of getting used to, but you'll soon get the hang of it. Energy Simulation The more you run, the more tired you'll be, so use your energy wisely, and save it for when you really need it. Slow Bullets Bullets are slow enough to see and hear as they whizz past your head, but not quite slow enough to avoid… unless you have incredibly good reactions. One Shot Kills If one bullet hits you, then you die and respawn, so make sure you don't get hit.",
