    "About the game": "WARNING: You can get caught playing this game for hours without a break... Zombie apocalypse top down shooter...classic? Not really. You play brave cowboy who fights zombies. Story goes something like this: there was a mad scientist who experimented with human genes. He was so sure in himself that he tested his projects on himself. Almost get him dead... Last project actually made him almost immortal. ALMOST! It made him a zombie. But wait, there is a catch. If he bites someone, that person becomes a zombie. You are one of the survivors, and your goal is to eliminate all the zombies, without getting killed. There comes in handy part with 'almost immortal'. Your bullets can kill them. Also, I should mention that there are 6 types of zombies. And, yeah, you do not have any help because the rest of survivors are in a safe house long distanced from you. So, good luck... Controls are basic: use your mouse to shoot, w a s d to move and r to reload. Everything else that you need to know, you will learn through playing.",
