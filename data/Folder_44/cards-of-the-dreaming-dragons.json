    "About the game": "How well do you know your friends? Cards of the Dreaming Dragons is the ultimate tabletop game you can play with your friends and family and tests your understanding of how they think. In this world of fantasy, you must figure out what dreams other people had and accumulate more points than any other in order to win. This is an amazing experience with friends, because you want to figure out what they are thinking, all while trying to win. It’s a game of trust, but also of deceit and with its fair share of challenges. How do you play Cards of the Dreaming Dragons? Each turn, a player is assigned the role of the 'dreaming dragon'. The dreaming dragon selects a single card from their hand. This becomes their 'dream'. They will provide a phrase which describes their dream. Then each other player selects a card from their hand which best matches the phrase given by the dreaming dragon. Once all players have selected a card, each player (except the 'dreaming dragon') will guess the 'dream' from all the cards. How do you win Cards of the Dreaming Dragons? If all players correctly guess the 'dream', then every player (except the 'dreaming dragon') scores 2 points. If no player correctly guesses the 'dream', then every player (except the 'dreaming dragon') scores 2 points. If at least 1 player, but not all players, correctly guess the dream, then the 'dreaming dragon' and any player which correctly guessed scores 3 points. If a player guesses a card that is not the 'dream', then the player who put down that card scores 1 point. Once all points are scored, this ends the turn and the next player takes the role of the 'dreaming dragon'. In order to win Cards of the Dreaming Dragons, you will need to reach the end of the game board first. Each point you receive will allow you to move upward on the game board. You are represented by a cute dragon on the board as you move through this fantasy world until the end, trying to win and surpass the enemies. Intense, exciting card game and board game experience Cards of the Dreaming Dragons is an exciting combination between a multiplayer board game, card game and fantasy tabletop. It’s also an immersive multiplayer game to play with the entire family or friends. It adds a lot of competition, fun, excitement and it also encourages you to strategize in order to win. Test out your skills, strategize and see if you have what it takes to defeat your friends and become the ultimate dragon!",
