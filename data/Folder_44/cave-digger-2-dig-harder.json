    "About the game": "Cave Digger 2: Dig Harder Cave Digger 2: Dig Harder is a 1-4 player VR adventure game in an alternative western dieselpunk frontier. The player is a prospector who begins their adventure in a seemingly abandoned camp with a goal to extract valuables from the caves, to trade them for new tools, upgrades, and locations in order to advance their frontier exploration. To unveil the secrets of the Valley, the player follows the breadcrumbs left by a previous explorer known only as Clayton. Tools and Progression Gear up with the tools you like and explore the ever-shifting caves ahead. Exchange your loot for money to buy equipment. With new gadgets and upgrades, you’ll be ready to go to new locations and dig deeper into the mountains than any adventurer before. Or at least that's what the Merchant Trading Company would tell when selling you their gear... But beware! You’re not alone. It’s also good to keep a six-shooter close just in case. Story The frontier has its mysteries and it hides them well. Follow in the footsteps of the treasure hunter Clayton and discover the strange history of the Valley and the caves below. Explore old mines, nautical caves, ruins of an ancient civilization and find the pages to a tale of greed, eldritch power and secrets beyond space &amp; time. Who the mysterious Clayton was and what he did in the Valley becomes clear in the end, but is it really the end? The story of Clayton’s exploration of the Valley is told in comic book form inside the game. Cave Digger 2 has many hidden endings, each revealing a new side to the story.
