    "About the game": "Welcome to Chronophbobia! A collection of wars and time altering discoveries has prompted a newer, deadlier tech-arms race than any other in history. The experiments were negligent, unpredictable, and have impacted the time-lines irreparably. During a military withdraw you are quickly swept away into a nightmarish hellscape that is, The Void . Death is a cycle here, and the abominations will hunt you until the end of time unless you can escape. But you aren't defensless, you're a trained soldier in a battlefield full of unique weapons and equipment, just waiting to be used! Be careful, explosive ammunition hurts both of you... Rebuild your Galileo Device with the help of the built in AI, and heal yourself, locate nearby enemies, or just drop some artillery on their unsuspecting heads with the Device's built in power-ups! Execute every ungodly creature in your way or sneak through the bloody rat infested trenches undetected to unravel the secrets of The Void . Return to reality or surrender to the abominations in this single player horror FPS campaign.",
