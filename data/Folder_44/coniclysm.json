    "About the game": "Coniclysm is an abstract third person shooter where the player assumes the role of an intelligence adapting for survival in a strange new universe. Key Features This isn’t your typical shooter--you will need much more than quick reflexes! Explore the strange universe where everything has a purpose. Unlock its mysteries and use your knowledge to your advantage! Steal abilities from your enemies and use them back at them! Absorb and level up each ability to get closer to universal domination! Brutally hardcore gameplay! Not for the faint of heart... we're really not kidding! Competitive single player. Can you take over the universe from the previous master? Compare your statistics to others on the online leaderboards! Vibrant out-of-this-world graphics. Featuring Miguel Kertsman’s Time What’s Time orchestra-meets-electronica album! (Point of clarity: Coniclysm Achievements are not Steam Achievements. They are a way to diversify play-throughs, giving another way to compare players on the leaderboards! We're sorry for the confusion!)",
