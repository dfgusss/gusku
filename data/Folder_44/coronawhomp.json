    "About the game": "The Virus Is Invading Your Base! If the virus gets through one of your base's holes, you lose! Luckily your defenses are awesome: viral cannons, whompers, super whompers, and in the PAID version, Ultra Mega Super Whompers! Stay alive for sixty seconds to win and help flatten the curve. Important Information Level 1 is free. Only the PAID version contains levels 2 and 3. 50% of our proceeds go to coronavirus relief. Warning: this game has no educational or social value. MAC USERS TAKE NOTE: Please play with a mouse, trackpad action does not work for CoronaWhomp! Ready...set...whomp! Designer's note Hi everyone, this is Chris Hart, maker of CoronaWhomp! Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you have fun playing. In our house, our standard way to play is with two people on one computer. A grown up relaxes in a chair and controls the base. A child stands and operates the whompers and the cannons. About 15 minutes of whomping every other day or so seems to help chase away some of the current blues. Please let me know what you think of the game, and thanks for whomping!",
