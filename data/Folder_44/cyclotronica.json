    "About the game": "Part Racing, part Shoot 'Em Up, part Puzzles, all Nuclear Physics! In Cyclotronica , players race through a series of experimental reactors and particle accelerators as 'Mr. Big', the ironically tiny rider of an ultra-high tech monowheel cycle, collecting subatomic particles, conducting experiments, dodging and doing battle with antimatter and radioactive isotopes using the patented S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Gun, solving puzzles, and discovering the Periodic Table of the Elements in the process. Cyclotronica 's single player campaign puts you at the epicenter of a novel research venture using the Mr. Big probe to run nuclear experiments from the inside, up close and personal - in places where humans simply cannot go on their own. 6 Campaign Levels: Ionization Accelerator Tunnel By Prescription Only Pop Nihilism Mobile Chernobyl The Rent-A-Tron A Naked Singularity, A Planck Star More Campaign Levels coming soon, with ongoing periodic new releases. This is a Father-and-Son project with just the two devs Randy and Jason, this was our art project for quarantine! All of your support is so appreciated and if you're having fun, we are too. NEW IN VERSION 1.0.2 Cyclotron Track Builder We've added a brand new Track Builder with well over 300+ Track Section Prefabs with which you can now construct YOUR VERY OWN PARTICLE ACCELERATOR -- and of course the ability to Save and Load your own Tracks. Right now everything's in Single Player BUT this will also be a jump-off point for Players to host their own Cyclotron Races and Crucible Battles later. There's a Materials Selector and a selection of different series of Accelerator Tunnel Prefab parts... Coils, Curves, and Straightaways, Gates and Ramps, Hazards, Particle Emitters, etc. I'm just cracking into designs for the tracks myself and will be releasing lots more parts and deeper Series Prefabs. Right now most Prefabs go up to about Mark V or VI. I could easily see them going up to XIII. The speeds you can attain are really something. Remember: There is no cap on the speed boost you can obtain from Electrons in Cyclotronica, and we pledge that there never will be. Stay negatively charged, Friends! Isotope Chamber Minigame The Isotope Chamber Minigame is in full service, less the online Leaderboard Stats [which we plan on doing for sure, and we'll sync all top scores when that happens]. The Isotope Chamber is a simple Clicker Minigame where you fire subatomic particles and antiparticles at Atoms you have created to try to discover as many different Isotopes as you can. We already had it out with version 1.0.1, but our Atom system wasn't fully fleshed out and we only had a measly 1,200 out of the now nearly 3,200 Isotopes known to Science. (I hit the books and made sure we had every Isotope discovered). Now that the Isotope Data Set is COMPLETE, you can start from a simple Hydrogen Atom and bombard it with Neutrons until it becomes Helium, then Lithium and so on up to the very heaviest elements, or go from the heaviest elements and get chain fission reactions and mayhem in the chamber that would absolutely kill you dead in Campaign Mode. Chip away at Atoms a bit at a time and watch them fall to pieces or detonate with the Antiproton and Antineutrons. All of the Isotopes have real half-lives calculated in real time, so theoretically you could leave the game running for millions of years and never get some Isotopes to decay unless you shoot them. Isotope Chamber now keeps track of your stats, showing: How many unique Isotopes you've Discovered, The number of Atoms you manually Created, The number of Particles/Antiparticles you Emitted in the Chamber, and Elapsed Time. Top Ten Scores as you continue playing. It weights scores by Discovered Isotopes over Time, with a minor portion being from Atom and Particle Spawns. We have more ideas on score weighting and future plans for how the Isotope Chamber works. Meanwhile... Improvements: Upgrades: Atom Catalog has been overhauled to work more with our vision going forward where it will be a sort of Atomic Spellbook. Atoms to be awarded to the Player through mission interactions stack up in Queue and are issued when a Player beats a level if so, and then Players can choose to exchange their spare Particle Inventory for additional new Atoms. General UI Upgrades everywhere as we march through and refactor bits of code and optimize it going forward. Lots of basic things like text highlights and colors for selected or unselected interface objects, tightening up copy editing throughout the UI, implementing beta tester feedback. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Gun Interface updated with better messaging and priority functions as you gather enough particles to use the gun, or after you've exhausted your ammo. Players get HUD messages and button instructions for switching Weapons when they first get enough Particle ammo as well. Messages happen once for each, etc. Weapon switching priority likely optimized - I know people have opinions about that stuff. I made it so that if you had a weapon selected and run out of Particles, when you get enough Particles again, you'll automatically switch back to your last used Weapon. Player Weapons updated with tracers. Weapon burst code updated for Neutron Salvo and Gamma Ray Burst. Neutrons now add +1 to maximum cycle damage [although they don't repair damage], in addition to their mass and use as 'ammo'. Antimatter upgraded with its own Chemical Symbol notation similar to Atoms, showing you a rough idea of its 'Hit Points' i.e. Antiparticle Score you're trying to zero out with the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Gun in order to destroy them. The notation also shows ionization charge as well so you know how many Positrons it may spawn when destroyed. Downstream Interactions like collisions with Alpha Particles now result in the creation of a deionized Helium-4 Atom [after they damage your GyroCycle and remove some of your Electrons, that is], which floats away innocently, mocking you. Things like that are necessary as I head toward implementing Fusion. Spare change has to be able to turn into Atoms and vice versa. Campaign Levels 1-6 have all received various upgrades: Level 1 - Upgraded hazards, adjusted ramp mix of particle types, improved the Inset messages. Awards Hydrogen to Player on Completion. Level 2 - Implemented full Isotope system on the Fluorine Atoms spawning. Lithium Bullet visual adjustments. Awards Fluorine-19 on completion. Careful with the Neutrons... Level 3 - Boss fight containment improvements. Antimatter Boss firing rate nerfed (still hurls dangerous three round Antiparticle bursts from both sides, often). Players are locked in the boss room after Entry. Separate Chamber from which the Antimatter Boss enters. Boss floats in before beginning attack. Level 4 - Isotope System fully implemented on all Atoms in Mobile Chernobyl. Awards Uranium-238 on Completion. Fission Blast damage radius adjusted. (Still balancing...) Level 5 - Z Align on all Sector Placards with Game Camera. X-Ray Flash stats updated. Level 6 - Gamma Ray Burst adjustments. Bug Fixes: Bulkhead Doors not opening in Level 3. Shader Opacity Persistence on Particle FX bug on MacOS/HDR issue. Weapon Controller deselect errors fixed. Stuck Key inputs now Scrubbed by any GetKeyUp event of the same type. Fix New Game function not zeroing out all parameters.",
