    "About the game": "HECTIC KITCHEN ACTION Diner Bros is a frantic cooking and restaurant management game where you must cook and serve meals to your customers before they get too hungry. You just opened your diner. As the first customers take their seats, you rush to the kitchen. One customer doesn’t want tomato in his burger, while the other one wants a drink. Those tables won’t clean up themselves either… If you take too long, your customers will leave angry and hungry, and you’ll soon go out of business! UPGRADE YOUR RESTAURANT Start off small, cooking burgers and serving drinks to a few curious customers. By upgrading your restaurant with new recipes, expanding the dining area, hiring staff, and impressing your customers, your diner may quickly become a bustling hot spot. With many different equipment to get and recipe types to learn, can your business earn the coveted 3-star award? KNOW YOUR CUSTOMERS You have your everyday patrons, but special customers with specific quirks and fixations will also visit. You have the construction workers, for instance: they’re always hungry and will order 2 courses. Or the runner, always in a hurry, who usually orders a salad. Keep an eye on any punks or thiefs: they will try to sneak away without paying, or will outright try to rob you! Then you have the divas, hipsters, lumberjacks... it takes all sorts to make a world, as they say! And finally, the most feared (and revered) of all: the food critic… NEED MORE STAFF? HIRE YOUR FRIENDS! Your restaurant will soon be too much for you to manage alone, so hire staff to help you serve your impatient customers… or even better: call your friends to help you out! Hire servers in the single-player mode or grab a friend to help you finish the wild 2-4 player local co-op campaigns. Call orders out, stay organized, and rush to your tables in this crazy, hilarious co-op! KEY FEATURES Cook and serve meals as fast as you can to keep your customers happy! Manage and upgrade your restaurant until you’ve earned the coveted 3-star award Get new equipment and learn recipes to offer new main courses and side dishes Serve drinks to your thirsty customers Attend different special customers such as the runners, construction workers, punks, and food critics... ...and beware the dishonest customers who try to rob you or get food for free!
