    "About the game": "Doll is a visual novel of horror and exploration. With the Jeudille doll, you will be free to explore the city of Lorgna. Talk to the inhabitants, and compare their speeches to succeed in answering the questions raised by this experience. There is no 'jump scare,' nor is there any stressful situation per se. The horror is in the very existence of the people of Lorgna. Some characters have several dialogues. These new dialogues are only available after an event and if the character is involved. If a resident gives you information as certain, it is probably verifiable... Carefully observe the places you visit. You may find useful clues.",
