    "About the game": "The universe is under attack from the most evil creatures in existence: geese! It's up to Captain Quackers and his trusty laser gun to stop the relentless march of Overlord Stumpy and the Evil Goose Empire. Jump your way across alien worlds, pick up powerups, and defeat bosses to drive back the enemy. Gravity will be different depending on the area, so sometimes your jumps will take you farther. There are 40 levels, and things start out fairly easy. The game becomes more difficult as you progress and new enemies and features are introduced. The true challenges lie off the beaten path in the optional levels which are labeled with letters rather than numbers. The most brutal challenge is level 4-C, affectionately referred to as 'The Troll Level.' Defeat every enemy and collect every coin in every level to unlock something special!",
