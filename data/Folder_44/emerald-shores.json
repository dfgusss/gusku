    "About the game": "Emerald Shores is a challenging SNES-inspired platformer with a bunch of twists. Level up, take on rewarding sidequests, play unique minigames, unlock secret levels, raise a pet monster, fight an optional mega-leveled beast of a boss, and more! Travel across a huge world map as you find your way to the floating island of Emerald Shores and liberate it from the invading monsters. When you've completed the main storyline, take on Remix Mode, which rearranges each of the game's levels to be even more brutal.",
