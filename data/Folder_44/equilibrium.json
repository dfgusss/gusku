    "About the game": "Equilibrium combines god-game, resource management, and planetary simulation into a cute, thoughtful game for Windows. Ensure that your procedurally generated planets remain habitable while keeping the population in the manner to which they have become accustomed. Minimise atmospheric pollutants, and keep global temperatures hospitable for human life. Or let dirty industry run rampant and produce a blazing hot tomb world. We're not your boss, it's up to you. Equilibrium is a planet simulator with an environmentalist twist – you manage procedurally generated worlds, trying to keep conditions suitable for human habitation. Manage the happiness of your global human population by providing a clean, liveable environment. Manage global atmospheric conditions by minimising pollution and encouraging the use of renewable energy and reduced consumption. Manage global average temperature to ensure ecosystem survival.",
