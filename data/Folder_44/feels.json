    "About the game": "Who are you and why did you come to this land? This is a dark age and not a place to be. Peasants do not leave their houses, lords stay in their castles. We're at the edge of the realm and unpleasant things are hiding out there. Do not take the current silence for granted. The fragile balance had been disrupted and terrible events are about to happen. If you're bold enough, you might be able to change this place's fate. But act wisely and remember, there will be no second chance. What if you could see all the possibilities? And experience each one of them? Feels is trying to push non linear stories to their limits. Using the strengths of both games and books, this Text-Based adventure aims to deliver as many endings as possible. What is this game? Feels is an ASCII and Text-Based RPG that runs on the command prompt. In this game you can play the way you want. Every one of your decisions, actions and non-actions can influence the world in which you evolve. Because Feels is not limited by advanced graphics, it will offer many ways to play, as well as a profound depth for the path you're choosing. Main Features: Multiple Endings Complete Soundtrack Turn-based Combat High Difficulty Genuine Characters How to play? Feels doesn’t give you much instruction and finding out how to play is part of the challenge. After choosing one of four gods, you arrive at a small village. The fate of the place is between your hands. If you do nothing it will fall to the disease. If you act things will change, but not always in the intended way. The goal of the game is to find all the endings. Each play-through is different and you’ll have to create different characters to find out everything.",
