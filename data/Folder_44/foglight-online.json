AI can be turned on for Farberto and human bots if players want a real challenge or wish to play by themselves. Track and chase your friends! Scent plays a key role in Foglight Online. Every player gives off a scent that Farberto can smell. But you can use this to your advantage. Create distractions or plan traps by throwing scented bottles of urine decoys. Hide or Fight!
