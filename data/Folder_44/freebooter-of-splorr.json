    "About the game": "Freebooter of SPLORR!! is a minimalist dungeon crawler where you take the role of the freebooter. A freebooter is a 'lawless adventurer'. SPLORR!! is a rough place. After an all night binge drinking session, you awaken in a dungeon maze filled with monsters. But at least you still have yer trousers. In order to leave this dungeon, you will need to combat all of its denizens. These can be anything from the introductory Evil Bat all the way up to the might Wyvern. Is this dungeon maze real, or is it all in yer head? I leave that to the interpretation of the player. To combat the monster, be they real or imagined, it is not a matter of melee prowess, but a matter of... successfully predicting whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the previous. Along the way, you'll get hungry. You'll need food. You will need courage and alertness in order to better combat yer foes! Fortunately, the dungeon is filled with helpful items like beer and wine, to help you be courageous. Coffee to help keep you alert. And above all else, there are Jools Galore! Defeat all of the enemies, and emerge victoriously with your hard-won Jools! Get defeated, and the grim reaper will mock you. In either case, try to keep yer trousers on, and for all our sakes, try not to soil them!",
