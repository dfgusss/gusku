    "About the game": "Goblin Tag: Try to escape into the Goblin Warrens without being caught. Completing each round gives you a choice in upgrades for your runner. Allowing you to be faster, smaller, jump higher or drop deployables. Those who are too slow and are tagged join the opposite team. They now help take down any survivors using whatever upgrades they have already attained. Single player speed run challenges These are tests of skill and precision that allow you to unlock cosmetic upgrades for your goblin and most importantly, bragging rights. Times are recorded in game and are shown off in the discord for the top runner. All the power-ups you gain are multiplicative and last throughout the game. Each mini game has it own reward factor that allows you to add another upgrade to your stack! If you decided to be a full throttle speed goblin you will really feel the power as you apply more and more of the same upgrade. Like to jump? Be like a flea! Stack hopping powers to bound over obstacles and go where no rival goblin can follow you.",
