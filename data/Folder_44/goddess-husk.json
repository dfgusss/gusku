    "About the game": "Story Goddess Husk is a macrophilia fetish, turn based RPG that is set in a gorgeously detailed pre-rendered world filled with warped, blood-thirsty mortals and lusty Goddesses. Assuming the role of a mute knight who has fallen from grace, you must guide your blind Mistress, the Awaker, through perilous lands in her quest to rouse the slumbering Goddesses of old with whom the fate of the future rests upon. Content Immerse yourself in a tale of dark fantasy full of love, lust and lore as you travel Vaelon in search of the Goddesses. The twisted mortals and beasts of the Scourge will doggedly hamper your every tentative step through these vicious lands but as the Awaker, you find you have friends in high places. Very high places... Gameplay Awaken and assume the forms of these beautiful and mythical Goddesses and turn the tables. Once fearsome foes will cower under the Goddess' feet and she can dispose of them any which way she sees fit. It's one giantess step towards saving mankind in the end... Features Turn based combat that utilises QTE and 4 directional input to chain combination attacks and defence mechanics. Custom ability tree that gives the player complete control over the levelling up and character building process. Beautifully rendered backdrops and painstakingly detailed character sprites. Play portions of the game as a Giantess, free to dismantle enemies at the mercy of your imagination. Epic campaign with typically 20+ hours game play. Fans of giantess and size fetish can enjoy content such as femdom, sizedom, footplay, breast crushing, ass crushing, vore, muscle worship and much more! Full game arriving on Steam ETA late 2021.
