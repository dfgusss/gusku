    "About the game": "Gravels of Endless War is a new online turn-based strategy game. There are 1v1 battles like in chess. Each gravel represents one unit. You have to create at least one team to start the online battles (but you can save different presets). Build your uniqe team! There are 18 available units but you can choose maximum 12. Each unit has a cost and you will have a budget so you have to optimize your selection. The unit's cost is very important because it determines how much you can move during the battles. The units are divided into 4 groups: Human Fantasy Mythical Spooky Unit types: Each unit has a type (Melee, LongRange, Magic). But be careful of the relation between the types. One type could be stronger than the other as you can see on the picture below. Each unit has the following properties: Damage Defense HP Visibility Luck Special abilities: Each unit has a special ability like Banshee's curse or Gashadokuro's movement restriction . Summon an elemental! The elemental summoning is the Peasant's special ability. If the peasant can go through the table and reaches the last row it will be able to summon an elemental. There are six elementals (Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Light, Dark). The elementals are not included in the 18 available units so they can be only summoned by the Peasant. The elementals are much stronger than the other units. Wall You can add Wall to your team. The Wall has very high defense and it has no cost. But use it wisely because you can place maximum 5 walls in one battle. Fight for the War Relics There are 3 war relics in the game. In the beginning the 3 best player will be the relic holders. The relics will be allocated after the first week. If a relic holder looses a battle than the winner gains the relic. A relic holder has to play at least 5 matches in one day or he/she will loose the relic. The relics won't provide any in-game advantage for the relic holders. About Pricing The game is free to play.
