    "About the game": "Pyramids are the tombs of the pharaohs. This is what most people believe. But more and more studies raise doubts about this thesis. Scientists found indications for ancient egypt being far more technologized than we can imagine. Hourglass is set in a scenario in which those assumptions are actually true.. Besides offering an ancient world to explore, Hourglass is mostly about solving various puzzles with a unique core-mechanic. Your ability allows you to record your actings for a certain amount of time. After that, time winds back to the beginning of the recording and a time-clone of yourself appears, repeating the actions. On your adventure, you will have to use this ability in creative ways to get through various areas filled with difficult puzzles. Your journey leads you to a remote temple where you encounter undiscovered egyptian technologies and portals to a foreign world. Only by unraveling the secrets of these long lost technologies, you are able to solve all puzzles on your quest and eventually find your father.",
