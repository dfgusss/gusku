    "About the game": "Let's step inside a new VR world in where there is no gravity but centrifugal force. Tisafolians are a peaceful and curious alien race, and they live far, far away from the earth. They collect samples from all over the known galaxies to compare improvements of each generation. They kidnapped Andy as a sample from our world and put him with other samples into a station to test some skills that are observation, analytical intelligence, eye hand coordination, weakness, etc. Andy will meet a friendly robot here, and they will be sidekicks. The station is in the middle of a black hole and consisting of connected cubes. You can go up which is down. But the VR headset always corrects the angle of view. In the game your choices matter and you will have a chance to try so many VR interactions and experiences. Space time dilation, gravity-free environment, a robot friend, tough decisions and so many surprises will be in the full version of the game. Save Andy! And do not provoke Tisafolians! The following screenshots are from the new release coming soon.",
