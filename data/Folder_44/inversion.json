    "About the game": "Don't just defy gravity. Command it. Take on the role of a young father and husband, Davis Russell, who finds himself thrust into war when his peaceful city is invaded by an unknown enemy. With his daughter missing and conventional weapons and tactics all but useless, this ordinary cop and his partner Leo Delgado will rise up to heed the call of duty, master the fundamental forces of gravity and save the world. Breakthrough Gravity-Defying Gameplay Learn to maneuver and shoot in an ever-changing state of global gravity, including weightless gameplay in zero gravity. Control gravitational forces using your Gravlink device to either increase or decrease the amount of gravity on a given target. Command gravity to crush objects in your way, float enemies into range or even pick up cars to use them as mobile cover. Pervasive Environmental Destruction INVERSION has been specifically designed to allow for maximum destructibility using the 'Havok Destruction' module. Blast through the environments, target your enemies' cover blasting it to bits or even knock down overhead objects to crush the enemy below. Innovative Cover System With bullets flying, seek cover objects in the environment or manipulate objects to create cover for yourself. Multiplayer Options Play through the compelling story on your own or with others in either co-op or competitive modes Battle with up to 11 friends in gravity defying multiplayer maps and modes.",
