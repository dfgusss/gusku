    "About the game": "Imagine yourself in a world with mighty battles and powerful magic, where deadly fireballs fly over your head burning everything to a complete hell. Where drakkars full of soldiers attack from the sea, giant trebuchets destroy castle walls, burying many warriors under the debris. All of that while the are simple soldiers, going through mud, fire, blood, trying to fight, survive and even win the battle. You are one of those soldiers. That’s what the Kingdomfall is about. One of the most advanced player-skill based combat system which consists of simple attacks, strong attacks, dodges, counter-attacks, shield strikes, many types of melee and ranged weapons, from bows to deadly magic - it is designed to not limit you in any possible way, if you're skilled enough you will have you're chance to win. IMPORTANT NOTE The game right now is in early access and will include only part of the future features to ensure everything works as expected. You can take a look at how most of the upcoming features may potentially work on the official YouTube page. They will be moved to the release version one by one when ready. Because of that the game will be available here at half price until full release.",
