    "About the game": "You are inside a multi-level dream. No one knows when it is over and you wake up in reality. Observe your surroundings and inspect everything. All around you is just a dream if you spot something strange. This is the only way to wake up. If you think that everything around you is the reality then try to survive until the time-out. However, if it's timeout inside a dream then you will die in reality. The goal of the game is to reach reality. You must be careful. Any awakening can be the final one inside reality. Don't get yourself killed in there. I was always curious how Dominic Cobb would feel in Nolan’s “Inception”. Or Doctor from “Doctor Who” when he was under the influence of dream crabs. Or Rick and Morty in the imitation chamber of alien reality. This is exactly why I made this game that is gamification of these situations. Knock Harder: Useless - this is the free version of the game, which includes only an easy level of difficulty Feature of game: Unique gameplay where a player makes a decision that can be fatal without any hints provided. An uncommon combination of two graphical styles. Great music 'Mistland Prattlers' by Lex-O-Lantern",
