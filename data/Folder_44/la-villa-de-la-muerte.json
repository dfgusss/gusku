    "About the game": "One villa. One family. One truth. La Villa de la Muerte is a looping psychological horror game inspired by the chilling tale of La Llorona. Explore an elegant villa filled with fragments from a family who mysteriously vanished. Explore the villa and solve puzzles to slowly reveal the truth behind what happened to the family, where they went, and who they became. Looping Environment Explore the villa as it changes alongside your knowledge of what truly transpired here. Puzzles Tour the environment to solve a puzzle in each loop to progress further toward the truth. AI/Stealth We lovingly call her Ghost Lady, she's pretty spooky. Hide in wardrobes, sneak under tables, or just run for it to avoid her. She will do whatever it takes to make sure you don't discover what happened. About Ottercide Studio Ottercide Studio is comprised of graduate game dev students at the University of Utah . Our game, La Villa de la Muerte , is the product of two semesters of hard work resulting in a 20-30 minute experience. Additionally, we owe a huge thank you to Berklee College of Music for contributing their time and talent to our game. FAQ Why Ottercide? Our team grew particularly attached to an adorable live otter stream that kept us peaceful while developing this horror game. Thus, we ended up with the play on words, Ottercide Studio as our development team name. Is this game a retelling of La Llorona? While the team pulled inspiration from the tale, this game is not a retelling of La Llorona. Instead, we drew from the lore to have something to ground us while also prioritizing remaining respectful to the story's origins. Folktales are a great way to keep culture and story alive while paving the way for new tales. We hope you enjoy our game as much as we loved developing it. Will the game be playable in Spanish? We had hoped to fit in localization during development, but it, unfortunately, did not end up falling within our final scope.",
