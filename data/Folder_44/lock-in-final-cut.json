    "About the game": "You're inside a strange house alone. You don't know why. You don't know how. You need to get out. Originally created for a 2-day game jam, Lock; In Final Cut is a point and click puzzle game where you must search through various rooms to escape, and maybe uncover what's going on in the process. You'll have to use your wit, items, and a few playthroughs to get to the bottom of this mystery. This small atmospheric game comes packed with new content that expands on the original game jam version of the game. Explore a house now doubled in size, search rooms now filled with interesting quirks and interactions, do it all in style with the new customization options you can unlock during your playthrough.",
