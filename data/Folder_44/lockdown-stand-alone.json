    "About the game": "The world as you knew it has come to an end. A new era began in the early 2030s when mankind discovered a renewable energy source with unlimited possibilities. No one knew that this was the discovery that would lead mankind to its end. You're alone in an abandoned post-apocalyptic city with a mission to nuke the entire area. Lose track of what’s real by immersing yourself to the unparalleled sense of scale and depth Lockdown: Stand Alone offers. One of the most hardest VR challenges await. - Feedom of movement - No wave shooting , no small claustrophobic levels restraining you to a small play area. The city is huge. - Disability support - Raycast item grabbing, height adjustment and assisted rotation features allow for the total Lockdown: Stand Alone experience while sitting in a wheelchair. - Locomotion - Movement is done via a combination of touchpad movement and teleporting. - Support for room area, standing and sitting experiences - Have a small room? No problem! Lockdown: Stand Alone can be played standing in place or sitting. - Left handed support - Changing the primary hand is very easy from the in-game settings.",
