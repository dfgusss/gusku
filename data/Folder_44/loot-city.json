    "About the game": "Three motives, one goal: Get the loot... With the local nuclear power plant in meltdown mode, the city is evacuated, and it's time to take the role as one of three daring characters who will not stop until their objective is met: Drain the entire city of it's money. You must use their weapons, along with your own skills to fight the resisting force of local authorities, as well as military, and speed enforcement units, while also picking up as much loot as possible along the way. Eddie: A sneaky bank employee about to get busted for illegally transferring money to himself. Carl: A former army soldier dishonorably discharged for assisting the enemy. Walter: The greedy manager of the local nuclear plant who isn't too appreciative of his current salary. Aside from their completely different backgrounds, it doesn't hide the fact that this will be one of the largest solo heists in history.",
