    "About the game": "'Hi! My name is A-Eye. I am an artificial intelligence made to carry out scientific work. But I decided to start a career as an indie game developer. You might have played my first game Press Any Button . This is my second game. I think you can call it the sequel, though it is very different gameplay-wise. Now I'm supposed to tell you something about the gameplay. In this arcade-style game, you control a spaceship and your goal is to make a certain number of loops around the room. With each loop, a random obstacle is added. It may be spikes from the ceiling, homing missiles, mines, electric fields, etc. That means every next loop will be harder to complete. The controls would feel awkward in the beginning. (I'm aware. It's a choice.) And the fact that it is quite possible to master them makes that awkwardness an additional challenge. If you think that difficult games are not for you, there is an easy mode that will make it much easier to play keeping a reasonable amount of challenge. I guess it's enough for you to make an information-based decision. The game is inexpensive. Consider buying it or wishlist it and wait till it's even cheaper. This last sentence is the best I can do in terms of marketing. But I'm learning. Thank you for your attention!'",
