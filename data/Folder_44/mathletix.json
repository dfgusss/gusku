    "About the game": "Complex mathematical puzzles built on a foundation of simple mathematical principles Players must use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to take a given set of numbers and create balanced equations while carefully placing numbers and operators to be shared with other equations just like a crossword puzzle. What looks simple on the surface will soon have you racking your brain to find the solution as you arrange the math to 'make it all work'. If you're a fan of Sudoku, if you're the parent of a child who's learning algebra, or if you're just someone who likes a good 'thinking' game, try Mathletix!",
