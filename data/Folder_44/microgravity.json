    "About the game": "Greetings potential test subject I'm a friendly astronaut studying the Hum species' and its ability to reverse gravity. Instead of jumping, it switches the direction of gravity to fall from the floor to the ceiling. Interestingly, it can only do this when it is standing on a surface or has just ran off one. To conduct my studies, I've formulated cookies that are both irresistible to a Hum and teleport it to the next experiment. I've also created nanobots to test the subject's intelligence. These are basic obstacles like a patrolling blade, a falling box, or a quad-directional laser blaster. If you can clear all of my experiments, there will be a great reward. P.S. If you see any hexagonal chips, don't eat them. Because um... The cookies taste much better!",
