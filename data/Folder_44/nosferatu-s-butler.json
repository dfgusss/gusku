Currently, it is still heavy ( the FPS is low . We believe it is due to the fact that all stages of the game are on a single level. We are correcting this). Development in progress. USE the KEYBOARD to PLAY A surveyor breaks into a mysterious and sinister Mansion on Pleasant Street in order to find his missing sister. She was last seen being interviewed by the mansion's young and mysterious Butler. This man, by the way, is nicknamed by the neighborhood “the butler of Nosferatu”. Because those who saw the mansion's owner say that his sinister appearance resembles that of actor Klaus Kinski — famous for playing the vampire Nosferatu in the cinema. This man — a doctor — is called Grigori and rarely appears in the mansion. It is said that he lives and lives most of the time in a real castle in Transylvania. This detail further intensified the myths and fake news that the doctor is actually a vampire. Some even believe it to be Dracula himself! The neighborhood is terrified of the mansion they consider cursed. However, during the day they attend the “public” library at Pleasant Mansion. The most bizarre: this girl is not the only one missing from the city. Your main objective is to find your missing sister. She was probably kidnapped by the Mansion Butler on Pleasant Street. Caution! The place is full of monsters: Vampires, Zombies, and other terrible creatures. Try using all resources to survive and achieve your goal: Save your sister from the clutches of the dangerous Nosferatu Butler. But, who really is Butler's boss? Of course, he is not Dracula.
