    "About the game": "Outpost brings the perfect mix between survival and roguelike gameplay. Start the game in a randomly generated environment and try to make it through as many nights as possible. How long can you survive? Each playthrough starts in a different season, forcing you to adapt even more. Spend you time wisely during the short winter days, or go the extra mile during summer! As the game progresses, you will unlock extra features for each of the four seasons . Every season has its own set of features, so you'll have to rethink your strategy! Every time you finish a playthrough, you gain experience that can be spent on upgrading your survival talents. Strategically choose your next move from 100+ upgrades . You'll also receive new items to wield , granting you extra bonuses and stats. Create your perfect set of gear , tailored to your favorite strategy! Defending your base can be done in different ways. Gather resources and create static defenses such as Turrets and Campfires , Cannons and Magic Crystals or even Snowman Cannons (what?!). You can also craft yourself a bow and join the fight yourself. With every season having different features, you'll have to figure out the best plan for each playthough! Everyone is competing to become the best. Are you capable of beating all your friends? Perhaps you even have a secret strategy that allows you to become Number 1 on the Global Leaderboards !",
