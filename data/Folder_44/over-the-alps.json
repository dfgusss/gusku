    "About the game": "Agent, we have a mission for you: we need you in the Alps. Go undercover, evade the police, discern friend from foe. Experience two thrilling stories from the minds of Jon Ingold ( 80 DAYS, HEAVEN'S VAULT ) and Harry Tuffs ( SUNLESS SKIES, HOUSE OF MANY DOORS ), which will see you step back in time to WWII Switzerland’s awe-inspiring Alpine countryside inspired by vintage travel posters to complete your mission. From a team with a pedigree of experience ( FAILBETTER GAMES, INKLE STUDIOS ), OVER THE ALPS features two independent stories with an additional third story coming soon. In addition to these free expansions, the new mechanical update, A Test of Character, adds an additional layer of intricacy to the police-pursuit mechanic, offering new ways to talk your way out of tricky situations along the road, depending on the traits you have developed during gameplay. OVER THE ALPS is available in 15 languages including Chinese (Simplified &amp; Traditional), German, Russian, French and Arabic; features controller support; and is available for both PC and Mac. Key Features A Truly Branching Narrative: Discover replayable stories that change as you make decisions, with multiple endings and secret stamps to be discovered. Stunning Vistas to Explore: Inspired by vintage travel posters, discover sweeping landscapes of beautifully-rendered Swiss scenery. A Race Against the Law: The police are hot on your heels. Stay on the move to remain one step ahead of the law. Stay Undercover and Trust No One: Struggle to determine friend from foe as you're plunged into the treacherous world of 20th-century espionage. Meet, befriend, and double-cross a colourful cast of characters. Upcoming Content! Plenty to Enjoy, More to Come: There are already two full-sized, self-contained stories for you to play and replay - and with one more to come at no extra cost, we hope your espionage skills are razor-sharp!
