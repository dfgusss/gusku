    "About the game": "Hi Gamers! We want to introduce You to our new project, inspired by an old classic video game but in a completely new truly 3D environment. We want to change it and move the challenge to a new level. Train Your spatial imagination with our 3D Game!. This is a maze game, where player needs to collect food from the whole maze and at the same time run away from creatures who want to capture You. You might remember very popular games like that ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). Unlike them, we’re sure You have never played in a truly 3D maze which made the game really challenging and required spatial imagination to find a way. In our game, the player doesn’t see the whole maze and therefore can be surprised by demons suddenly blocking the way. This can train your brain in quick reactions and planning ahead. We hope that this game can bring you as much joy and excitement as it did to us. Bonus We've discovered one more [un]expected positive thing from playing this game. Sometimes we asked friends for opinions about games or help with testing. I don't know how many hours he plays but one feedback is very important for us: 'I've never like shopping centers, I always missed there the orientation, but now it's easier for me to understand building structure and make a map in my head. I know where I am, I'm able to imagine that. It can not be the due of pandemics, the Demons Hunter learn me that'. It wasn't our target, but messages like that make us happy because we made something useful not entertainment only.",
