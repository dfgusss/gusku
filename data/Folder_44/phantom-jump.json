    "About the game": "You only have 4 seconds to live. Rhythm events called phantom jumps restore your life and allow you to move across levels in fun and innovative ways. Phantom Jump is a game about thinking one step ahead to go through levels as quickly as possible. Each level was carefully designed to allow maximum speed if played optimally. 5 worlds with their own fun and challenging features that will change the way you traverse each level. Once you reach 80% level completion in a world, a boss fight awaits you in order to unlock the next world. Leaderboards let you compare your times with your friends, nearby players, and anyone else globally. Can you push the limits of the game and achieve world record times? Online multiplayer allows you to challenge your friends to a race to see who can traverse levels the fastest. Select a world and race in randomly chosen levels. Once you have mastered everything phantom jump has to offer, try out speed run mode to really put your skills to the test. Once started, a timer will appear and your goal is to complete all the worlds and defeat the final boss as quickly as possible. Many extras such as replays, achievements, rewards, secrets levels, and easter eggs make for a highly replayable game.",
