After 43 years of war, the Onix triumphed and defeated the humans. The victory came at a cost of destruction to their planet and orbital stations.

Key Features Hack computers to rewire electronics to make them work the way you want Travel through twenty different stations to help Maria escape from the Onix Enjoy a vast amount of electronics and an armory of weapons to stealthily, or violently, get passed the Onix Guards Experience the unique cloning system where you can never lose in a level Earn upgrades that allow you to hack with more efficiency Collect different hats to take down the Onix in style Enjoy an immersive soundtrack created by Liz Rainsberry",
