    "About the game": "Safe and Sound is a 2D survival game, made completely by one person. You are on a huge island, full of biomes and places to explore. Your goal is not just to survive but also to thrive and live the story the game tells you as you play. Each biome on the island has a safe area where you can build your base, store resources and craft tools, but be careful, as over time, hordes of monsters will come and try to destroy everything. When you're not in a safe area, you'll be able to find many more resources, story-telling events, new monsters, animals, and even protective bosses in the region. Explore this big world, manage your resources, tools and weapons, protect your base and be safe and sound.",
