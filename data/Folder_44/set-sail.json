    "About the game": "Set Sail is a western visual novel set in the modern day where the Golden Age of Pirating never properly ended. The player takes the role of a young pirate who has lived their entire life sheltered on a famous pirate ship known as The Red Plague, captained by The Demonic Pirate Ricardo. Through a first person perspective, you meet and engage with colorful characters on your pirate ship, the odd members of the Pirate Culture Club, and people you regret interacting with in the first place. You make the decisions on where to go and who to interact with, these choices impact dialogue, relationships, and future events of the game. What you download is a stand alone experience, but with more downloads and support a full game could get made.",
