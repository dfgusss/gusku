    "About the game": "***Steam community: Since I'm working on Solar Fighters alone using my own efforts, it's taking more time then I've thought but i'm still working on this, fighting games are really hard to do, several details and tests. Doing my best to leave Early Access as soon as possible! '-' Help Gaia fight battles to protect her prestige given by the Sun. Gaia is the most lucky among the others 4 personas in the Solar System, this leads to a rebellion intended to stole the Gaia's glory. These first 5 characters are the start of a solar battle in our system, but this can be much bigger as the way through this goes. Fight against other planet personifications with the help of Luna or defeat Gaia and her life-mate to reach a great glory.",
