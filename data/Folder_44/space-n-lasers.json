    "About the game": "Welcome to Space 'n Lasers! Do you like space? Do you like lasers? Do you like puzzles? Well, space is cold and devoid of oxygen, and lasers will burn your eyes out. But puzzles...puzzles are good, safe, clean fun, and you should do more of those because your mom says so, and we can provide you with 1 of 3 things that you enjoy. To make up for not being able to eject you into space, we made sure to include an awesome soundtrack! We've got all your favorite toys! Mirrors, walls, wormholes, beam splitters, color splitters, combiners, filters, switches, locks / barriers, and even explosives, they're all here. Better call the bomb squad, because there are a lot of explosives. Fun! Work your way through 70 mind-bending, space themed challenges; you won't even need to hold your breath. Puzzles increase in difficulty as you progress. Slide, flip and rotate the tiles. Combine them in creative ways to unlock the targets and get that sweet dopamine rush that you so desperately crave. Don't even pretend that you don't! Play the demo that includes the first puzzle set of 10 levels and then get the rest to prove to your friends how smart you really are! Keyboard and controller support available.",
