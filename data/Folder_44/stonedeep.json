The more your civilization grows, the further you have to spread your tunnels. Seasons Your dwarfs have to survive different seasons with different weather. Level up your resident's civilization levels Currently, Stonedeep has nine civilization levels. Every civilization level increases your daily tax income, but also increases the needs of the involved residents. In Stonedeep similar to the real world there is a limited amount of gold coins (money). You have to spend your money to get it back from your residents. Current Status Stonedeep currently includes over 80 resources, 5 different biomes, over 70 buildings, 9 civilization levels, and 8 types of adversaries with different variations and 4 animals. Early Access - what's done &amp; what's to come - September 2021 All 4 planned milestones were added between September 2020 and September 2021.
