    "About the game": "Who am I. Why do I work, why do I live. Can I play the Game if I do not know how. Am I a gear or the Creator. And is it possible to be both at the same time. And why octopuses don't like cats. Mystical drama on the game-riddle platform. A piece of the unfriendly world, aggressive to outside investigators. The shard of consciousness laced with Vonnegut and Shakespeare. And a tooл for that worлd disклo_sure. Key features: - casual turn-based strategy - upgrades - procedural battlefields - bunch of experimental elements - the text decoder, half-automatic generated history, esoteric poetry, etc. - multiple endings - unusual presentation The road will be mastered by only a man possessed, slow and steady one wins the outer shell only, but the simply curious can get a flick on his nose. And if you're not ready to call to mind - stay away from her.",
