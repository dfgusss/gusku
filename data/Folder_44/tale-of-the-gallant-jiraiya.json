All legends contain heroes, all heroes have beginnings, this is a origin of the legendary hero Jiraiya, Young Thunder. Jiraiya was born in a house of nobility; before he could speak his first words, his father was slain. As an teenage orphan, he was forced to raise himself and quickly turn to a life of crime to survive. His young heart still believed in justice, so he stole from the rich and gave to the poor. One day before he could commit a heinous act, an old man appeared before him. This toad sage offered to teach Jiraiya magic.

We have learned that disabled gamers, also enjoy our software due to simplicity of the controls and production value. Lastly, many adults have approached us to give thanks for creating an application they can enjoy with their child. Frequently Asked Questions: 1) Is your 4th Visual Novel based off of Naruto? Kishimoto's Naruto, has several characters that are featured in our Visual Novel. Kishimoto and several other companies took inspiration for the legend, 'The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya.' They have used the characters in that legend in their own derivative works. Our 4th Visual Novel tells one of the original legends of 'The Tale of the Gallant Jiraiya' and is not based on Naruto. However, if you read our Visual Novel you may see similarities that Kishimoto did to the original legend of Jiraiya. 2) Why are you covering international stories, instead of popular domestic tales? We really enjoy world culture and we're trying to avoid limiting ourselves to popular western stories. We like to alternate between international and western stories. Our 5th Visual Novel, will cover a western fable.",
