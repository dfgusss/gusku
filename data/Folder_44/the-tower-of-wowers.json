    "About the game": "Our debut title, 'The Tower of Wowers', brings toilet humor to soaring new heights as you valiantly fight in beautiful turn based combat through such diabolical terrors as Acid Trip, Claug : The Shit Dragon, Ghost Made of Human Skulls and the dreaded, Ian (among many others). Think you can defeat the Tower? This game features : •Amazing custom sounds and songs from Pancake (awesome up and comer talented composer)!!! •Plenty of unique enemies, some bosses or even RAID bosses with over 100 items, armour and weapons to collect! •Battle in the rain or snow! We almost broke the budget with these 2 in-game weather features!! •Recruit 5 or more (if you choose) characters with the Character Recruitment System as you climb up the tower (total of 8 characters to play!). •After finishing climbing the tower you get access to a Elevator ! Select your floor and go, no more stairs! •Traditional turn-based combat with new and clearly superior Retro Sideview Combat ! •After completing the game you can recruit a few enemies to your group! Holy shit that's amazing! •Speaking of shit did we mention that you collect them for currency?! How exciting! •Even defeat some *Shit* Variants of enemies in battle (special versions of them) including ExPOOsed Brain Cat, Gateway from the PEEyond and more!",
