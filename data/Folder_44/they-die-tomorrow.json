    "About the game": "They Die Tomorrow is a horror co-op investigation game for 1-4 players that sends you to the scene of a murder right before it happens. Use your equipment to gather evidence and protect yourself from the killer, and identify them before they find and kill you! Multiple Ways to Solve: Use any combination of -- or only one of -- visible evidence, observed behaviors, and analyzed mementos to figure out the killer! Equipment Placement Modes: Start the map with equipment placed outside the map, or switch it up some and have the equipment randomly placed inside the map instead! Multiple Threats: The killer isn't limited to merely killing players. Players may experience slow deaths or may be impaired as the match goes on. Multiple Starting Points: When starting a map, you will either be placed at the entrance by your equipment... or on the opposite end of the map, where you'll have to fend your way through the map to start the investigation. Killer Bestiary: Observed behaviors contribute to the completion of the Bestiary, which unlocks extra rewards! Banishment: Use the right item at the right time to banish the killer for extra rewards!",
