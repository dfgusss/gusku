    "About the game": "Tier 1 is a new take on a 2D space combat simulator. Dogfight in a fast and nimble space fighter, or control interplanetary space using a large lumbering space ship. Features Choose a ship/fighter from nearly two dozen classes. (More will be added over time) Run games with up to 200 AI bots. (If your computer can handle it) Massive Scale - Control anything from tiny space fighters to super-carriers that can carry other space ships! Use the in-depth Radar systems to find your enemy, or use jamming or stealth systems to evade detection. FTL systems are available to travel long distances quickly, but don't crash into anything along the way. Game Modes Rout: Destroy the enemy ships while protecting your own. Map Control: Control all of the capture points to win.",
