    "About the game": "Developer's Notes Trapper's Delight was originally envisioned as a party game. So we recommend that you gather your friends for a couch-play experience or play with them online. Please keep in mind that as an indie game with a small player base, it is not always possible to find players online. About the game Trapper's Delight is a game where players create a gauntlet of lethal contraptions and secret traps. Once all of the traps are in place, players have to try and navigate the traps in real-time along with the other competitors. To score points in Trapper's Delight , players will need to reach the goal safely. To prevent others from scoring, create the most devious traps possible... but make sure you can navigate past them too!
