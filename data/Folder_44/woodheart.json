    "About the game": "Explore the open world of Irel in this top-down 2D adventure. Placed in the shoes of a young boy named Ash, you run through the unfortunate mishap of ruining an old man’s pumpkin patch. For compensation, he asks you rid his village of the evil Firerom lurking about. Slay monsters, loot riches, and traverse treacherous dungeons as you battle your way to glory. Or maybe glory isn’t what you want - because that’s fine too. Maybe you'd rather get away from all that, and have fun in puddles, jumping, running, and looting. The choice is yours, after all. Find treasures and items such as this grappling hook that allows you hook enemies and bring them closer to you or swing them around, dealing damage to other enemies as they collide! Fight enemies and bosses in fun ways such as picking up and throwing enemies at each other, or use your sword and slash them in traditional melee combat. Sing with a bard, flirt with a hedgehog, and cry with a tree stump. Explore the world and find dozens of funny dialogue interactions with the characters, creatures, and creations of Irel. We will update the game with more content and bug fixes, so please leave your review and what you want to see next.",
