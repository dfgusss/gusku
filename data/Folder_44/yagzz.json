    "About the game": "YAGZZ! - it's a cool, platformer, where you have to play for a dark goblin who collects the souls of his enemies. Our dark knight will bounce off the walls to fly over a pile of buzzing saws, slip through a bunch of lasers and run away from thousands of witches, seals, monkeys and many other cute monsters. The alternating complexity from light to heavy and vice versa, will carry our afroamerican guy through underground temples, snow valleys, tundra and even through hell itself. *30 interesting levels with upcoming updates. *Over 35 Steam Achievements *3 Localization languages (Russian, English, Spanish) So 'touching' the story that you will sob in the pillow for the rest of your life Please add your feedback so that we can add cards, thanks :) Warning: does not support gamepad*",
