Not all levels have been added and all planned content will be added by final release. YOLTRUND Yoltrund: The World of Eternal Woe , a short story written in 2014 by Michael Cox, now takes flesh as Yoltrund . Using unique lore and characters, this tale is told. Long before, there were Two, two brothers of The Ones Who Came Before; one of Light, one of Shadow. These brothers collided to form a third; one of Flame. The One King, burning with anger and hatred, created the Void that lives in all things; the barrier between realms to prevent his elder brothers from fighting further. He then succumbed to Sin, causing his eternal fires to rage onward in beautiful shadow. In doing so, he created his realm of Yoltrund, where he punishes such sinners with purifying flame. He then vanished, never to be seen again. YOLTRUND, THE GAME Experience the gripping tale as you play as a lost soul, trapped within Yoltrund, and must find his way out of the realm of eternal fire.
