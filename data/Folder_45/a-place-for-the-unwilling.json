    "About the game": "A branching narrative adventure set in the final 21 days of a dying city. Every decision you make will shape your surroundings, and the city’s fate. However, the clock is ticking - and the city carries on, with or without you. Speak to everyone from eerie politicians to chain-smoking child anarchists. Work as a trader, socialise, explore the town freely, and play a role in the city’s hierarchy. Combining the exquisite narrative depth and exploration of Sunless Sea with the curious setup of Majora’s Mask - plus a dash of Lovecraft - A Place for the Unwilling is a rich narrative experience where player choices really do count, set in a Dickensian world of colour and Eldritch nightmares. The city is hungry. It will devour us all. Dream with caution. Features: The clock is ticking. Lose yourself in a strange new world that dies in 21 days. Hyper branching narrative. Your every decision changes the environment, and the final outcome. Living, breathing world. It’s the ultimate branching story adventure, where the world carries on, with or without you. Each walkthrough is unique. Over 100 narrative events based on everyday decisions and big shape a unique story. Wide cast of characters and in-depth narrative. Covering themes of inequality, isolation, cosmic horror and more. All story, no puzzles. No combat, mini-maps or quest markers. Story is everything.",
