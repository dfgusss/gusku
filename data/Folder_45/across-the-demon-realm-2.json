    "About the game": "IF you want my last game CURSE OF RASUMAN to appear on Steam too, please support on Kickstarter: -of-rasuman-the-story-of-archibaldoega-limited-colour Many developers have forgotten what makes a platformer game fun. In my opinion we must forget the giant and redundant labyrinths and go back to basics: Many have tried to make games that are sometimes very pretty but terribly boring after having crossed the same levels over and over again. I simply would like to make a linear platformer where the player cannot get lost as it is unfortunately too often the case in recent productions. The story: You are the mysterious Darko whose face no one has ever seen. If you played to the first'Across the demon realm' you probably discovered that Darko was a demon.(Spoil: Let the female zombie kill you! ) The gameplay: Only a button to jump and a button to attack, what's all! (No Rpg elements but a lot of weapons to grab! Sometimes you will steal the weapon of a defeated enemy! ) Today, platform games (especially the metroidvania) have become like some open world games: gigantic games where you can go everywhere but which are often full of the same sort of monsters...boring and repetitive. I would like that the player does not get bored so the levels are less extensive, more linear but more varied. Across the demon realm 2 aims to surprise you in ways few games have before by introducing constant changes in environment, traps, monsters, dialog and plot twists! And, the most important, you will never get lost in a gigantic level where all the walls are the same! Use the keyboard or a joypad to play (I don't try other controllers but if it's recent enough you should use it! ) Warning: I'm sorry for this but the start button (pause) don't work, you need to use the keyboard key 'esc' to pause. Mature content: a pixelated nude female zomby and a nude pixelated woman-plant. they are two enemies to fight do not expect to live the great love with them, they are rather aggressive!
