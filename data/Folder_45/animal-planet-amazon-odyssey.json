Navigate a boat down an Amazonian river and take a moment to feed the piranha and sneak glimpses of panthers, gators and the elusive pink Amazon dolphins. Control a paraglider over awe-inspiring cataracts formed by centuries of erosion from some of the tallest waterfalls in the world. Experience the Amazon Rainforest up close and personal in the comfort of your virtual reality headset. You will learn facts about more than a dozen animal species living on the land, flying in the air and swimming in the water. Just don’t forget to bring your mosquito repellent!",
