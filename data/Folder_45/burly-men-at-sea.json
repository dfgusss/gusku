    "About the game": "Burly Men at Sea is a folktale about a trio of large, bearded fishermen who step away from the ordinary to seek adventure. With gameplay halfway between a visual novel and a point-and-click adventure, the branching story carries its ungainly heroes into waters where lurk creatures from Scandinavian folklore and other misadventures. You play as storyteller and wayfinder, shaping a custom tale that begins again where it ends. FEATURES Branching Story : Play through multiple choice-driven adventures, each designed to be completed in a single sitting. Innovative Controls: Shape the narrative through a unique, draggable viewport and your interactions within it. Playful Aesthetic: Colorful art style with handcrafted animation, set to a whimsical original soundtrack inspired by folk music of the far north. ABOUT THE DEVELOPER Burly Men at Sea is the second game from married duo Brain&amp;Brain, developed during their own adventures as nomads and erstwhile farmhands.",
