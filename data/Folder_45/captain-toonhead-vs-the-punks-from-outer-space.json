    "Release date": "Nov 11, 2021",
    "About the game": "A truly first-person tower defense, designed for VR: This is not your diorama-style VR tower defense. This time you’re going to have to move all over the map, hammer away to upgrade your towers, throw over-powered chanclas recklessly and shoot electric beams from weaponized pizza at your enemies. Fight from the front lines! Not the hero we wanted, but the one we got stuck with: After the whole squad sent by the World Treaty for Freedom (WTF) got fried by a burrito-related explosion, it’s on Elliott Salazar, the cartoon-obsessed facility technician and the only survivor, to save Earth. There’s a new captain onboard: Captain ToonHead! Take control of your towers: Take manual control of a tower to project lethal beams of hot sauce from your hands, ignite infinite heat-seeking fireworks, irresponsibly spray a snowball machine gun, shoot rays from electrified pizza slices or unleash a piñata blitz over your enemies. Balance action and strategy: You're going to do a lot of shooting, that’s for sure, but shooting alone will not defeat the waves of Cyberchickens, punks and Terra-sharks. You’re going to have to combine those Piñata towers and chancla throws in a very strategic way if you want to save more Enercubes and destroy the EarthRadicator-1000.",
