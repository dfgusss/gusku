    "Release date": "Apr 15, 2022",
    "About the game": "Over 300 collectible creatures! That's a lot of creatures to collect! And with over 130 different latent powers, and over 10 different attributes there's plenty of variety to craft the perfect strategy. Mix and match different monsters to formulate a synergistic plan! But be warned, while you gain one of your opponents cards when you win, your opponent gets one of your cards when you lose! (Story mode only) Robust and complex mechanics make for a interesting game! Many different factors play into if you win or lose. You'll feel great when you can outsmart your opponent! Win by 'capturing' more creatures than your opponent. Each card has 4 sides, and each side has a number. That number is how powerful that creature is on that side. If two cards are placed adjacent to one another, whoever has the lower number is captured. But wait! Many different things can effect that number including latent powers, attributes, and even the very tile the card is placed on! A variety of game modes. They include a match against a random enemy with your deck, random enemy with a random deck, using your deck against a preset challenger you've encountered in the Capture Mansion, and using your deck against an opponent you've challenged before to gain back your lost card. Coming soon is local and online multiplayer with any creature you've collected previously, and local and online multiplayer with random creatures. 3 different types of latent powers. There's Active powers that activate when the card is placed on the field, Reactive powers that active when the creature is captured, and finally passive powers that activate every turn this card is on the field. Difficulty scales with player familiarity, as you play you rank up and unlock new challenges! There's 4 different levels of difficulty and each add a new twist to the game so it stays fresh. Local and online multiplayer (coming soon) Beautiful art style based on early 2000s jrpgs. If you like the more popular jrpgs you will love this game. It's an interesting twist on the classic jrpg, and card game genres. Thanks for reading!",
