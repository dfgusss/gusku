    "About the game": "Three lives, one death. You die — you start over. Items and enemies are different — the dungeon changed… Saved some gold? Great — maybe you’ll live a little longer in the next run. This is Carrot Heart — a coop roguelike for 2 players. And you’ll need the second one. Why? The enemies — 18 types — each with their own abilities. 13 of them with 3 armor modifications. One enemy — you use one tactic. 3 enemies together — 6 tactics simultaneously. Still want to fight alone? Use the same weapon all the time — die within a minute. 12 melee weapons — 7 ranged. Select them according to the situation. Weapons break, however… So you use the environment! You break that cask with oil — the enemy slows down. You don’t wait — you burn the oil… …and enjoy the fireshow! A fire enemy nearby? Are they fireproof? Break the cask with water and cool ‘em down! Then immediately electrify them… Anything else? Keep an eye on casks with acid, gunpowder, bonfires, and spikes in the floor. But remember: You lure the enemy into your trap — try not to get caught in it yourself! Is that it…? Not really! The dungeon holds some helpful backups: weapon enhancers throwable weapons explosives food traps... Or you could craft these items from found junk! Surely you can throw a stone at the enemy and give them a slight headache… OR you could find another stone and make a bolas out of two. One throw — and the enemy is immobile! Hungry? Eat a carrot now — you restore 1 Health Point. Mix the carrot with a chile pepper — 2 Health Points, a pinch of Fury bonus — and the delicious salad is done! Play around and combine! Bon Appétit! Want to get the items immediately? You can build and upgrade 4 structures at your base: a workbench an alchemy table a field kitchen and a garden One structure = one item! So now you think you’re all armed and dangerous… Don’t get loosey-goosey too soon — you might be cursed! Some enemies, traps, and magical items apply Curses to you — slow walking, no health restore, etc… But if there’s a Curse, there should be a Blessing! One Blessing token — one positive effect: electric feet, fire hands, armor enhancement, etc. Combine the tokens from one set correctly together — get the best out of them! Vile enemies, and ways to pin them down — going to do it alone or with a friend?.. It's up to you! Ah yes… Almost forgot… The main characters are not some fluffy-wuffy wabbits — no — these are legit hares!",
