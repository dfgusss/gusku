You must succeed in various challenging platform goodness. Our hero will leap from walls, over seas of lava, through pools of old spikes.

Castle Of Pixel Skulls is a tough as nails platformer where you play as an animated skull who's trying to escape from a haunted castle. Complete a lot of different levels to escape from castle. Castle Of Pixel Skulls hopes to bring back the blend of pure fun and challenge that was a staple of arcade classics. Will you get to the end of Castle Of Pixel Skulls? Are you ready? I'm a indie game developer and my name is Josep Monzonís Hernández. I love create simple, fun and well designed games. My great inspirations are mostly games from the 8-bit and 16-bit era. I like every aspect of the process involved in making video games: pixel art, coding, game design and drawing. I've worked on several indie games. Castle Of Pixel Skulls is my last solo developed game project and has been in development for the past 1 year.",
