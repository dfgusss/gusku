    "About the game": "NOTE: This game can only be played by streaming directly on Twitch. ChefSquad is an experimental game from the makers of Cook, Serve, Delicious! In ChefSquad, chat plays as the cooks, while the streamer plays as the all-seeing, all-controlling head chef. Work together to get orders out quickly or you’ll fail the day. Unlock new foods, challenges and more as you progress through the 6-8 hour campaign! Why is this game free? We wanted to make a small experimental game after making our last large scale game, 'Cook, Serve, Delicious! 3?!' The tech we used to power this game (such as Twitch integration) will be utilized in future games and it was just fun being able to make something creative and unique!",
