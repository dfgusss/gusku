    "About the game": "It's the year 2150 and thanks to advancement in science and engineering, mankind established colonies throughout the solar system and beyond.    In Colonies, you take control of a planetary base. Explore strange planets and discover important resources that your industry needs to ensure your colony prospers.   Build up your industry and exploit the planet’s resources.  Your enemy will not sit idly by while you expand your base. They will make every attempt to stop you. For this, you will have to deploy a powerful army with tanks, mechs, and defensive towers.   Research other areas of technology and equip your mechs with a variety of different weapons available in your arsenal.   Will you harvest and export enough resources to fulfill your mission goal in an economical way, or will you make things simple and attack and destroy your enemy right away?   It’s up to you, Commander. Your colony is relying on you.",
