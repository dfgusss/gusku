    "About the game": "We hope to express the way we play in the early and middle stages of the game through the LAN console version 1.Slot machines (the road to the devil) Nostalgic for the slot machines of your childhood?Here is a perfect restoration of the 1970s slot machine, big three, small three, all have prizes, small four happy, open the train, roaming Fried, chain Fried, all seriously restored. In the game, the player can use him to earn super high game currency, although from the probability, this is impossible. 2.Towers of Power - Respec, Rematch, and Strategize Each tower type has its own strength. Towers are divided into 7 types based on a tower's HP, attack, attack speed, attack range, growth potential, and skill slots. Mixing, matching, and placing towers is, of course, a topic of much controversy among players. Play around with tower combos and see which one yields the best results! 3.Mechanism of Death Be careful or you'll lose it all! Dying in Massacre Tower means you'll lose all of your hard-earned rewards return to Level 1. Respawning will randomly determine your tower's new attributes. Push forward for more rewards or stay put and play it safe? It's up to you! 4.Dungeons – Ludashi, Green Cycle Spend your time how you see fit! Focus on these two tasks, or focus on research to maximize your rewards. 5.Skills - Refine Your Arsenal Choose between 34 unique skills and outfit your towers with the most devastating combos for the slaughter!",
