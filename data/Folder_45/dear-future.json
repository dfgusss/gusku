    "About the game": "Dear Future is a multiplayer wandering game where you photograph a cryptic city using an inherited camera. Working collectively with every other player in the world, you must document the ruined land of your predecessors and lift an ancient curse. Tread across a procedurally-generated world of pseudoclassical architecture and take photographs in it, saving a single one to pass down to future players. After your first session ends, the next player will inherit the camera and continue from where you left off. What will you leave for those that come after you? Use the camera tools to create striking and creative photographs. Restore paths to open hidden areas to future players. Leave messages to help future players delve deeper into the city. Uncover hidden truths as you drift the depths together over generations. A UC Santa Cruz Games &amp; Playable Media MS Capstone Project.",
