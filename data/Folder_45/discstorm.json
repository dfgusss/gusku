    "About the game": "Fast-paced and furious, DiscStorm is an arena combat game where split-second reactions are essential to dodge flying discs as they ricochet around at breakneck speed. Meet up with your friends at home and challenge them to intense multiplayer deathmatches. If you want to really test your skills, then the single player adventure boasts diverse settings such as haunted mansions and pirate ships - all of which come with their own formidable enemies and epic boss fights. Inspired by 90s console classics, DiscStorm evokes retro nostalgia with its upbeat chip-tune soundtrack and bold pixel-art visuals. Successfully progress through the vibrant environments and you'll not only earn achievements for your efforts, but also be rewarded with quirky new costumes for the cast of characters. Fast-paced arena combat - Gameplay that's easy to pick up, but truly difficult to master: dodge and deflect flying discs as they ricochet around the arena at lightning speed. Energetic local multiplayer - Invite friends over to battle. DiscStorm offers a variety of compelling game match types; fight it out in a classic first-to-ten deathmatch or strive to keep the crown in the hectic 'Regicide' mode. Epic boss fights - Each arena brings its own unique play-style and enemies. Whether it be the laser-shooting Stone Golem in the jungle temple or the lava-spewing Fire Elemental of the volcano lair, exciting new challenges await you at every turn. Striking retro art and music - the soundtrack fuses modern dance trends with retro chiptunes, whilst the artwork blends classic pixel art with high fidelity graphics. A controller is highly recommended to play DiscStorm, a list of supported devices can be found HERE .",
