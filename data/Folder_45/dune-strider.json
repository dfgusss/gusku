The world is populated with other merchants doing their own trading and raiders that will try to ambush your vehicle and attempt to destroy it. Engage with them in a strategy oriented combat where positioning and aiming will be your strength. Earn your profit, upgrade your ships combat abilities and become unstoppable! Features Interactive Settlements: Trading in markets for profit, upgrading your ship and abilities and taking quests. You are able to interact with these thriving settlements in the otherwise barren desert Living Desert: Trading requires you to travel the mystic desert and brave its dangers. You will be ambushed by sand pirates on your travels. You will use your sand barge to travel these lands and hopefully thrive in this risky environment Personalized Sand Barge: With the gold you earn from quests and trading you will be able to personalize your sand barge. Choose your ability set to your liking and personalize your way to traverse the sands. Realtime Ship Combat: Ships will have several abilities to defend themselves from the dangers of the desert. You will use these abilities in a real-time battle. Use positioning and aiming to overcome the enemies.",
