    "About the game": "'Eyes of Darkness' is a psychological horror video game, featuring early 90's graphics and music, vast player's freedom and multiple endings! Leonard White, a professional inspector, is looking for his ex-girlfriend, Kimberly Frances, gone missing in Goodsprings, a small town near Nevada holding the darkest secrets... The plot is inspired by the great classics like Twin Peaks, Rosemary's Baby, Suspiria and Ringu. The setting is made to feel lifeless and isolated, like the time has stopped and the player is walking in a dream-like world. The video game focuses on paranoia, making the player distrust their surroundings: the screen will show an eye icon to suggest the player when they're stalked, but won't tell where the danger actually is hiding.",
