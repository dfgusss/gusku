    "About the game": "FIND AND KILL THE EVIL KING is a game about.........finding and killing an evil king in a cursed, endless dungeon. You play as the MAIN CHARACTER and try to hunt down the EVIL KING in an endless, repeatable dungeon. Gameplay-wise, it can be described as an extremely simple deck-builder that's heavy on the RNG. You get six 'card' slots that you can use on MELEE ATTACKS, DAMAGE SPELLS, or HEAL SPELLS. You get cards for beating enemies, but you never know what you're going to get...so plan wisely! Featuring: 16 fully animated cute-as-hell 2.5D sprites made by @Pprofl 6 awesome 8-bit tracks made by @devindecibel 70+ pretty-okay old-school bitcrushed sound effects made by me (with help from my brother) 15 pretty-okay action animations made by me extremely randomly-generated dungeons with dangerous progression an 'altar system' that provides some measure of self-chosen difficulty a personal high score system......how much will you sacrifice to get it? Extended from the 'MobileRPG' Tutorial Series by HeartBeast. Made with love + Godot.",
