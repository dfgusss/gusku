    "About the game": "Five Seconds of Bad Music is a puzzle game based on physical objects. The goal is always the same, but achieving this goal requires ingenuity, care and patience. FSoBM is the perfect 'time killer'. Using the launcher you have to shoot down the target cartridges marked in red. It sounds simple, but in reality it is not. Contents: 150 levels of varying difficulty. Some levels are very, very difficult, but we believe that you will not give up. :) Sounds in the game - a consequence of your actions. Some levels give you the opportunity to create a really interesting melody. Each puzzle must be solved in 5 seconds so some levels require special speed and accuracy. Hint system will help with solving any puzzle.",
