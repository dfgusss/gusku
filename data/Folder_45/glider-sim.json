    "About the game": "Experience the ultimate sensation of gliding through the sky! Glider Sim is a professional paragliding and paramotor simulator built for real pilots in mind and is aiming to achieve photorealistic graphics! You can fly in Free Flight mode, Multiplayer mode or Challenges. The sim can be played outside VR or inside VR. We recommend playing in Virtual Reality as it provides the highest level of immersion! The simulator takes place in Sun Valley, ID, United States. The scenery is derived from real world satellite imagery and overlaid with high resolution textures, grass, trees and wildflowers! The scenery also includes custom placed roads, houses, buildings, power lines, soaring eagles, cruising airplanes and more! We are striving to create a beautiful living environment with many placed detailed scenery objects that you can discover as you fly and explore the map. Lots of attention went into the flight physics of the gliders as well as the wind and thermal system. Set your launch point and flying conditions then takeoff into the skies! Use wind current such as ridge lift and thermals to stay airborne, or if you're using the powered paramotor (Paramotor Trike) throttle up and cruise over the detailed scenery. You can toggle on and off the wind visualization particle systems as well as change other flight conditions such as wind speed and direction. Experience state of the art flight physics where each cell of the glider is modeled and has physics applied! You can do maneuvers such as wingovers, spirals, stalls, and swoops. Watch out and don't let your wing collapse! More features we hope to add to the game during Early Access is as follows: More Scored Challenges/ Missions. 2 more scenery locations. Don't forget to share this experience with your fellow gliding enthusiasts and we look forward to hearing your feedback in the community hub as we continue development! See you in the skies! --------Special Note --------- If you are interested in hooking up Glider Sim to a harness while in VR we have a separate edition called Glider Sim - Harness Edition. It includes bonus features such as flight tracking and post flight analysis tools. Meant for Instructors and the die hard paragliding pilots.
