    "About the game": "You are trapped in a room...Please Comply with the orders to have a hope of escaping the observation room. How did you get there? How will you leave. Will you do what is required? Only one exit seems clear, a locked door, beckoning you from the other side. You NEED to open that door, but something tells you not to go through it. What is real...can you trust your own mind? FEATURES: A foreboding sense of despair Something that wants you to open the door An abandonment of the material Unnerving sounds That door A second chance for someone else In 15 to 20 minutes you will decide your fate, will you comply, will you resist? A short time but a lifetime of consequence is what awaits you in Please Comply. This is but a taste of what is coming next in CMD:Studio’s “Horror Stories” Anthology. Please Comply is a very short game that leaves a long lasting impression.",
