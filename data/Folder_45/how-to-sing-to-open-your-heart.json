    "About the game": "'How to Sing to Open Your Heart' is a fully voiced romantic otome visual novel. As the next entry in the 'Story of Eroolia' series, this game shares the same world with the previous games, ' How to Take Off Your Mask ' and ' How to Fool a Liar King. ' This time Princess Myana, who previously appeared in ' How to Fool a Liar King ', will be the new heroine. *We recommend that you play the previous games (at least the demo) to get a better understanding although it's not necessary to do so. STORY 'Can the cat-eared princess' song rescue her people and find true love?' Princess Myana loves to sing, and believes she can make her people happy with her song. This time, she visits the human's country 'Eroolia' as the leader of 'Laarz', the country of cat people. Relations between humans and luccretias have never been good, and Princess Myana experiences it herself in Eroolia. Will her song be able to unite the hearts between humans and luccretias? Or as the imperial guard captain, Ludovic, argues, is it better to completely cut off ties between the two countries?
