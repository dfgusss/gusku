    "About the game": "Making a world is very complicated. You have to combine one atom and then another and another ... until you reach 133,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 To manage all these atoms you have to know how to use them well; learn to bind and master them. You can't stop evolving. Your piece of rock will pass through periods, ages and aeons. More and more chemical elements will appear. And all this to make an entity reach its final evolution. God created the world in 6 days... and you? GAMEPLAY: This game is based on the idle/clickers, but was transformed to make it fully active. Besides the typical options of the time-managers, in Idle Evolution the strategic part has a much more important role. Throughout the game you will be guided by missions and levels, but it will be up to you to decide when to follow them or your own path. In short, this is an original and different game, capable of mixing strategy and management with an educational part, without forgetting the addiction its idle base provides. DURATION: Playtime: 10 hours (active time) Speedrun: 7-8 hours (total time: active + idle time) FEATURES: -3 difficulty levels. -More than 200 missions. -Quiz. -Minigames. -A lot of upgrades. -118 achievements ingame and 40 in Steam.",
