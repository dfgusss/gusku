    "About the game": "As seen in Singapore's Doujima , Glass of Water Studios is proud to present It Comes Around , born from a partnership between Glass of Water Studios as well as Afterthought Studios ( Forgotten,Not Lost &amp; A More Beautiful World ) A ritual to solve the mysterious death of a schoolmate goes horribly wrong, trapping the students and teachers of the Sugimori Occult Club in a horrible game of cat and mouse. Who will survive this nightmarish hell? The game is currently available in Windows, Mac as well as Linux. 'With our low price point, we hope to attract more readers to our project and bring a little bit of horror into their lives.' Zechariah Ho, one of the founding members of Glass of Water Studios said. 'We sincerely hope that everyone will give us creative feedback and criticism so that we can further perfect It Comes Around as well as future products.' Darren Kwok, founder of Afterthought Studios , hopes that the art revamp will come as a welcome reward to those who so warmly supported It Comes Around on Steam Greenlight. 'Their openness to feedback from the campaign has allowed them to improve their product. It Comes Around will not be everyone's cup of tea, but everyone that we know who has tried it, loved it.'",
