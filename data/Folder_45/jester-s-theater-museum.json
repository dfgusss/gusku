    "About the game": "This game containing adventure and horror elemts is intended for adult players only. This story is a part of the Witch Chronicles series launched on Halloween. After Chelsea's disappearance, her siter Melissa decides to go on a searching mission. The search leads her to the mysterious Jester's Museum: theater that has opened in the town. The invitation seems intriguing and Melissa decides to seize the chance to find out what happened to Chelsea. To get the adult ending, players should free all creatures from the time loop by bringing them to our world. As usual, you will be faced with a choice – to free them and let the Jester win or to seal the exhibits forever in the prisons of their own. The adult part of the game is just an element of it, but not an option that you must choose. It all depends on the main character's choice. Upon finding herself in the museum, Melissa will have to decide whether to continue searching for her sister or to seal the cursed place.",
