    "About the game": "Story Kate's Test is a story of wish fulfilment, in which a miserable girl is gifted the chance to turn her life around. A group of demons offer her the body she's always wanted, in return for her services in generating energy for them. It's a simple exchange but it does have risks. If she overloads the magic crest they give her, she'll lose her humanity and become a succubus, incapable of self-restraint. Kate agrees and is put to sleep to undergo the change, and that's where things start going awry. The sleep program seems to be pushing her into scenarios designed to make her give into temptation and become a succubus. What's going on? What will she do? Will she still be herself when she wakes up? A cute and lewd adventure game with multiple endings. Gameplay The game was created in RPG Maker VX ACE. First playthrough should take about an hour to complete, depending on player skill. Failures are encouraged, as conversations change as a result. This game is modelled off the traditional RPG Maker Horror games such as Ib, The Crooked Man, or Witch House. The game contains no horror elements however, and instead of death scenes, lewd punishments await Kate should she fail. She is tasked with collecting 3 treasures from 3 handcrafted scenarios in order to wake up from the sleep program. Each scenario has it's own themes and gameplay, and plenty of fun punishment scenes for if she fails. The Orc Village Set in an orc village in a tropical climate, this scenario focuses on traditional puzzles for kate to solve and traps to evade, but the Orcs won't be pleased when she enters their temple and steals their treasure. The Lord's Castle This scenario is a stealth based RPG, Kate takes the roll of a ninja. She sneaks her way through the Lord's Castle. She can backstab guards to avoid combat, repeated fights can wear her down so the player is free to choose how she takes on the challenge. The Casino Packed full of minigames, this scenario is set in a casino. Kate must gamble her way to victory to gain access to the VIP room and obtain the last treasure.",
