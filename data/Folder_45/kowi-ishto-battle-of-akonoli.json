If you've had photosensitive seizures, due to flashing lights or playing video games, play at your own discretion. The game features a Flashing Lights Reduction Mode. When in game, press pause, then turn 'Flashing Lights Reduction Mode' on or off. This turns off the Players, Enemies and Bosses from blinking white when hit. But there is still some blinking objects in the game even when the Flashing Lights Reduction Mode is turned on.

However, there are still some drawbacks if using a Direct Input controller. Which would be: Mapping might be unreliable. Some Direct Input controllers cut in and out creating a “stuttering effect” with the player movement. Direct Input controllers do not rumble when used without external software (Use external software at your own risk.).",
