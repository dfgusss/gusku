    "About the game": "Late'O'Clock is a capstone school project that we worked on for 6 months. NailGun Studios wanted to make a comedy-like stealth game that had an ever-changing and dangerous work environment. This vision allowed us to create a game based in an office, but throw unexpected obstacles at the player. The game has 15 levels in total with a lot of collectibles that give a little lore to our small world. This was our first team project for this long so it was a new experience for all of us. We wanted our game to be on a public platform for free so we could look back on it as we pursue our careers, and for you, the player, to enjoy. Thank you for taking the time to read this and we hope you enjoy playing our game as much as we did making it.",
