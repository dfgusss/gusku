She’s beloved by the people, despite her relatively young age, and many consider her a goddess among mortals. She fought in the battle of Kadath in her youth, saved Amaranth Village from destruction, and has defeated hundreds of Talia’s enemies with her sword... But there’s one legend about Arcadia nobody speaks of. More than ten years, a horned dragon attacked Freycross Village. Arcadia happened to be there at the time, and could have saved the lives of the villagers – but she didn’t. The village burnt to the ground, and almost all the villagers perished. Arcadia might be a hero, but those who survived the attack on Freycross Village resent her. They hate her. They even want her dead . Arcadia A legendary knight whose name is known throughout Talia. The people have given her numerous titles and accolades – the Scourge of the Battlefield, Champion of Kadath, the Protector of Amaranth Village – but she prefers to go by ‘Arcadia’.

With her faith in her own country shaken, Arcadia has retired from the life of a warrior… But things aren’t always that simple.
