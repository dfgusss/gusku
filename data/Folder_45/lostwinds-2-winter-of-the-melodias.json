    "About the game": "LostWinds 2: Winter of the Melodias is the follow-up to the award-winning title ‘LostWinds’. In this new adventure players are able to instantly transform Mistralis between Summer and Winter, harnessing the brilliance of nature: frozen winter ponds and waterfalls become deep, teeming summer pools and chambers in which to dive and unlock secrets, enemies can be frozen or doused, and the very air itself used to form snowballs or moisture-laden clouds. Other amazing new abilities include the cyclone, which can be used to transport Toku, smash powerful enemies and even drill through the rocks of Mistralis’ diverse, richly interactive Chilling Peaks and Melodia City areas.",
