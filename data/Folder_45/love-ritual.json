    "About the game": "Story Love Ritual will put you into the shoes of a young woman Riilai, a professional scientist with extensive knowledge of occult rituals. In the midst of a big case, the police reach out to her family seeking their expertise on the forbidden ritual that had taken place at the crime scene. Riilai arrives in the city to find that the police have two suspects in custody, one belonging to the Necromancer League, the other from the Druid Circle, and both claiming innocence. Under extreme pressure, it is up to Riilai to use her expert opinion to determine the guilty party. The suspects each have an advocate from their respective groups ready to defend their clients and sway Riilai to their side. Remaining neutral will be hard for Riilai however, as both advocates are as charming as they are passionate in their defense of their clients. But, over the course of the investigation, things take a darker turn and Riilai will have to trust her heart to see her through to the end... Key Features Mature Narrative 40,000 words dedicated to a convincing romance storyline and investigative plot!
