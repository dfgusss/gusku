    "About the game": "Written with love... and something much worse. This room holds your biggest fears... and a diary. Its every page describes heartfelt feelings for a boy, and what happened 3 years ago in a small town of Rosen Peek. Maybe none of those things matter to you. Nonetheless, you must read through the mystery diary to keep on moving with your life. However, unknown horror grows within the walls as the past catches up with you and a sweet love story turns into a tale of madness. So sit down, and start reading. Game Features: *Atmospheric horror that takes place mostly in a small room that keeps changing as the story progresses. *Diary-driven storytelling that focuses a lot on reading than exploration. *A short story about the fine line between love and obsession. *It's everyone else's fault.",
