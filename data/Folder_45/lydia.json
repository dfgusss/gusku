    "About the game": "Lydia is a grim but atmospheric visual novel which deals adults substance abuse from the perspective of a little girl. The story is based on developers own experiences on the subject matter. Lydia is a story game in the vein of To the Moon. Spectacular gray-scale graphics with a hint of color and dark, ambient original soundtrack sets the tone for the melancholic story. Lydia is an emotional journey to the depths of the imagination of a small child. Can you find the monster? Story first: Compact structure serves the story. The game lasts about 1.5 hours. Gray-scale hand-drawn graphics by published graphic novel artist Henri Tervapuro. Original score is composed by renowned film composer Juhana Lehtiniemi. Lydia is a sweet little girl who loves her Teddy very much. Teddy has been with Lydia from the very beginning. Lydia can’t remember living or playing without him. Lydia has never adventured nor found crickets from the nearby playground without him. Lydia loves Teddy and Teddy loves her back. Recently they’ve had difficulties sleeping. There are a lot of loud noises coming from downstairs. The adults are having their own adventures there. Every night, all the time. And of course there is the Monster . It is always there, hiding somewhere in the shadows where the eye can’t see. Adults said that the monster isn’t real, that it’s all just imagination. But the adults are wrong. The monster is real, although Teddy keeps telling that it isn’t. He keeps telling that everything’s going to be all right. Teddy will always be there, watching Lydia. Keeping the monster away. Making sure, that Lydia can sleep through the night. But this time the sounds are louder than usual.",
