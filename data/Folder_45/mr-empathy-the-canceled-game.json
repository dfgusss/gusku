    "About the game": "Mr. Empathy tells the story of a supposed hero in a supposed world with supposed social criticisms, metaphors and puzzles. The game is a satire of many things in order to make the player not only have fun but also reflect. About the game There are more than 32 stages with an NPC in each stage (or almost) where you need to talk to each NPC to lower the elevator and you proceed to the next stages, the game has two protagonists (having changes in the stages for each protagonist), Mr. Empathy has a lot of moves to use when you play with him, Mr. Sympathy uses only the moves left over from the level that was made with Mr. Empathy, so don't use too many moves! Taking ours off the straight The game has no political alignment, any resemblance to a person who exists in real life is purely coincidental and the metaphors can be interpreted in many ways, not just one.",
