    "About the game": "Hello, dear friend! I want to tell you a story about the Mushroom Cats that live on the magic Toadstool. It will be a very kind and sweet adventure! Try to imagine the tallest building in the world. Did you imagine? So the magical Toadstool is even taller! It reaches out to the sun through clouds and clouds. And around it the ocean splashes loudly. On this Toadstool live fairytale creatures - Mushroom Cats. They built their little houses on Toadstool’s hat and even built a mill to grind clouds. Yummy cakes are made from cloud flour. Mushroom Cats love to bask in the sun or just sit back. They love to play musical instruments and listen to the sound of the ocean. But here's the trouble! Winter will come soon and it will be very cold! The Good Fairy made warm hats for Mushroom Cats, but dropped them when she flew by the sun... Someone has to help the Mushroom Cats find all the hats and get dressed for winter! I hope it will be you!",
