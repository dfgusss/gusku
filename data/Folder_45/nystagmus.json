    "About the game": "An island, shrouded with darkness and clouds of mystery, is your only hope for salvation. In this first-person horror game, your character, an engineer in search for his fiancee, arrives at the suspicious island you’ve only ever heard about. When your boat suddenly breaks, you are trapped on the island. You must hunt down the materials on your list to rebuild your boat while also searching for your missing fiance so you can leave as quickly as possible. But soon, it’s evident that it’s not going to be that simple. And as a strange blue light shines over your figure, the one thing you can do now is run and hide. Maybe you’ll survive… if it doesn’t find you.
