    "About the game": "Onslaught: Armoured Assault is an indie real-time strategy, space survival simulation, where you the player are tasked with building a starbase, gathering resources, and creating a fleet to survive the onslaught of wave after wave of alien starships intent on your destruction. Explore the void, chart mineral-rich asteroid belts, and destroy pirate outposts in an epic struggle for survival. Fight to your last in this endless game mode. Survival mode charges you with a sole starbase in a vast area of space; in this vast area, you will find trouble, and rewards. Gather resources, build up a fleet, and prepare for the alien menace that lurks in the darkness of space. Your enemies are relentless and will mercilessly destroy everything you have built; only the strong will survive. Fight on for as long as possible, accumulating score on an international leaderboard. Prove to your friends that you are worthy of the mantle of Admiral! Ever dreamed of a hundred starships blasting each other apart in fiery battle in the void? Make your dream reality in Onslaught: Armoured Assault, where there is no population cap on the number of ships that can be built. The scale of war can range from a single ship to a several hundred, with numerous fighters darting between these behemoths of interstellar war. Customise to your hearts content; Onslaught: Armoured Assault offers unparalleled ways in which you can kit out your ships, from the look of your fleet to the weapons on individual ships. The in-game color customizer allows you to change the primary, secondary, and trim colors of your own, and the enemy’s, starships. Each class of starship has its own unique add-ons, allowing for you to build the perfect design for the battles ahead. You will encounter many different ships and weapons, all with their own unique abilities and effects; optimise your fleet composition, balance strengths and weakness, and defeat the alien foe! Onslaught: Armoured Assault uses community suggestions and feedback to create weapons, ships and balance adjustments. The game is built around being fun and enjoyable for everyone. The onslaught will never end!",
