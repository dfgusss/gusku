    "About the game": "In this game you have to help the main character to hold on in self-isolation with limited resources. Every day you face a difficult choice: how to eke out your groceries, whose request you should respond to, and who is to be left without a piece of bread. And most importanlty: how to find and properly divide activities so you will not go insane as a result. While playing the game, you are going to have a lot of exciting quests that can fundamentally change the game process. The lives of the other characters, as well as your own, depend on you. You can make new friends and even have some of them live at your place. Whether you can withstand the devastating monotony and maintain a sound mind, or you will surrender to depression, depends only on you. Stock up on food so you do not starve to death. Find some new entertainment to perk up the main character. Go through the exciting quests and make new friends. Be careful, danger awaits you at every step of the way.",
