    "Name": "Perfect Round Disc Golf",
    "Release date": "Mar 12, 2020",
    "About the game": "Classic Golf gameplay, inspired by Hot Shots and Tiger Woods games, updated for Disc Golf! A faithful interpretation of the sport powered by Unreal Engine 4 and coffee. Key Features Real disc golf! The best physics in a disc flight simulation, combined with DGA Mach 7 baskets and 51 real Discraft/DGA discs creates the most realistic disc golf game to date. Play alone, or bring some friends! Level up your abilities in a solo round, or invite up to 3 friends over to your house for some face to face trash talk! Multiplayer rounds can also be played over Steam Remote Play Together. 12 courses to play! From a challenging par 2 island course to championship style courses with par 4 and par 5 holes, master each of 207 unique holes and compete for a spot on the global leaderboards! Wacky characters! Because who wouldn’t want to play disc golf with Sun Wukong, the Monkey King? If that’s not your thing or grandma stops by for a round, you can always turn on nonfiction mode from the character select screen. Motion captured animations! The most accurate animations for a disc golf game yet, all recorded with a motion capture suit from real throws by myself. Give me some form tips! About Me Having been a gamer since playing Civilization 2 on my parent’s Macintosh, when I started disc golfing 8 years ago it didn’t take long before I looked for a game in the style of classic golf games, but with the unique flight and challenges that come with disc golf. When I realized that game didn't exist, the idea of creating it myself stuck with me until I finally downloaded Unreal Engine 4 and started learning the engine to make it. This is the disc golf game I want to play, and I am always taking recommendations from other players who feel the same.",
