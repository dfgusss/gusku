    "About the game": "Poltergeist Treasure is an absurdist comedy point &amp; click adventure game set in the strange (and often silly) magical land of Artovya, but actually just in a forest. As the brave knight Sir Typhil of Creulor continues his quest to bring a unicorn to the castle and be crowned king, he finds himself trapped in a haunted forest by a malevolent ghost. As with all of the games in the series, Poltergeist Treasure is mainly a point &amp; click adventure, but with elements of other types of games present as well. In this episode, a section of the game is a top-down stealth game. As stated immediately above, this is a point &amp; click adventure game and thus contains the standard compliment of point &amp; click adventure game features including: Walking around from place to place by pointing and clicking! Talking to NPC's by choosing dialog options and receiving witty responses! Picking up everything that isn't nailed down and putting it in your inventory! Using your inventory items on objects or people in the world in order to solve puzzles! Using your inventory items on other inventory items in order to solve puzzles! Using your inventory items on absolutely everything you see because you're stuck on this puzzle and can't figure out what to do! Literally slapping yourself in the face because that puzzle solution was so obvious and yet it took you 20 minutes to figure it out! Also, as already stated, a portion of the game is a top-down stealth game, and as such contains the following features: Walk around and avoid obstacles, some of which are moving! um... yeah... that's pretty much all the features of a top-down stealth game. While a stand-alone game in its own right, this game continues the over-arching story from Unicorn Dungeon: / Also see the sequels: / / /",
