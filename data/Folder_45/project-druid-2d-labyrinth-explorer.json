    "About the game": "Project Druid is a game from the past. It was made according to the rules of lost and forgotten systems and games. A game without the fancy graphics and system from todays games. A game you can sit down for and just play and enjoy. It can be hard it can be easy , it all depends on yourself. A labyrinth game based on the concept of the c64 game Druid. Simple graphics and simple game play which will keep you busy. A small but entertaining game. Find the keys and exit hidden in the labyrinths to proceed and try to stay alive while your playing. Old skool graphics and game play. - Total of six levels of big labyrinths - Bosses - Monsters NOTE : THIS IS NOT A TRIPLE A GAME - ITS JUST A SIMPLE CASUAL GAME - The game was build from scratch with Game Maker Sudio over a period of two years. Most of the graphics were completly made from scratch and a few are from other sources. Controls are WASD with mouse. You will like or hate this game. I rather hope you will like it. NOTE : Please comment on the game and game play. If you find bugs please report them through our website.",
