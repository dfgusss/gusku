    "About the game": "Ratergy is a competitive local multiplayer game for family and friends. With its short rounds and its cute rats fighting over a piece of cheese, it is a family-friendly and suited for casual gaming. The game deliberately refraines from using violent content and is therefore suited as a humorous game for and with kids. It is a 2-4 player local multiplayer focusing on playing together on a large TV screen or monitor. Ratergy offers enough action to brighten every party. Through the simple game mechanics and the fast-paced combat rounds, it is aimed particularly at occasional players and beginners. Expert gamers however have also the opportunity to fight over the cheese dominance on a strategic level by using game elements such as conveyor belts and power ups. Newbie or advanced player - it is all about the most efficient tactics to gather cheese! Game principle At the beginning of the game, every player chooses a rat nest with two rats. By switching the control between his rats, the player now tries to be the first to bring 10 pieces of cheese to his nest. He can choose between several levels, which offer a variety of gaming elements for a more diversified battle over the cheese. The player can use conveyer belts to get faster and activate door switches to block the way for opposing rats. The usage of power ups such as speed potions, shrinking devices and bombs guaranties dynamic combats and a lot of fun!",
