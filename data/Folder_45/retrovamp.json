By sliding, jumping and wall riding you will move around a map filled with obstacles, at every death you will be forced to start from the beginning or from one of the five checkpoints that you can spawn around the map. Controls -Move left and right with 'A' and 'D' or arrow keys (or optionally a controller) -Jump with 'Spacebar' -Double-Jump with 'Spacebar'x2 -Spawn a checkpoint with the left 'Shift' button PHOTOSENSITIVE SEIZURE WARNING A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these 'photosensitive epileptic seizures' while watching video games. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms - children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: • Do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.",
