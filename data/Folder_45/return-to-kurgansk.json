A long time ago, the search for an endless source of energy led to a disaster, now the lands around Kurgansk are infected and cursed and the locals have lost their minds. You have fallen into these mad places by mistake and are trying to find your way back, while hundreds of evil monsters stop you from doing it. A stranger helps you by giving out instructions on the walkie-talkie, but can you trust them? Huge open and diverse world, completely changing with the onset of the night Explore a vast territory where mysterious monsters roam the deserted streets of villages, and dangerous anomalies manifest in abandoned cemeteries. Uncover the secrets of an abandoned military base and fight monsters in underground bunkers. A mesmerizing VR horror game where you can truly experience fear for your life Surround sound and compelling visuals will help you adopt the role of the hero and feel when they are hungry, injured or starting to go crazy. All interaction with objects and battles with enemies are adapted for VR devices so that you dive deep into the cursed world of Kurgansk. A powerful system for crafting weapons and equipment will help you to survive In order not to perish, gather supplies and hunt. Spend resources wisely, and you will be able to create various tools, weapons and equipment. Remember: there is no problem that cannot be solved with blue duct tape! Mysteries of the zone will drive you crazy Sometimes the radio catches someone's voice reading a combination of numbers, or you find documents about an unknown virus and strange drawings with pagan rituals. What does this all mean? It’s time to find out! The world of Kurgansk is full of mysterious dangers. Anomalies kill with fire or electricity, they are invisible, fly and can lie in wait anywhere. But they are also a source of valuable artifacts that will allow you to survive in this difficult time. Only you can make decisions here! While it’s possible to fight monsters with your bare hands, or throw rusty cans at them, you can also cut everyone with an electric-saw mace, powered with good old Soviet era batteries. There is an option to act as a ninja, killing local monsters with W-shaped transformer plates. Don’t be afraid to make a mistake and fail. Remember that death is just the beginning in Kurgansk!",
