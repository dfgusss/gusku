    "About the game": "After nearly decimating all of mankind, humanity looked to the stars to rebuild their past glory. Under the guidance of a hero and his loyal followers, life was brought back from the brink, their legacy bringing forth peace that lasts to this day. But, trouble brews on the horizon... Play as Captain Junius Fahrenheit, a soldier of the United Terran Vanguard onboard the state-of-the-art ship, the Sierra, as they and their crew are thrown into humanity’s first interplanetary war. Tasked to protect Earth and free its colonies from under the Ares Confederacy of Mars’ grasp, there’s no question that they must fight to protect everything they care for... ...Are things really as simple as it seems...? Experience the first part of the story of Sierra Ops! Game Features Strategic mobile tower defense gameplay with shoot 'em up elements. Beautiful hand-drawn anime visuals with lovingly rendered backgrounds. Partial voice acting. Hardcore mecha action. Ship and loadout customization Morally gray storyline spanning over 160 000 words that reacts to gameplay performance and choices. Everything you do matters and has consequences, big and small. Taking one opportunity may mean giving up on another. You only have so much time to act! Elaborate, time-sensitive relationship system with six characters to befriend one on one and to casually interact with around the ship... maybe it’ll lead to romance? Wibbly wobbly weird stuff! (Not guaranteed) Disclaimer: Before purchasing Sierra Ops - Please note that the game was originally a free-to-play episodic game. However, due to visibility issues, Valve suggested we switch to paid app with both episodes 1 and 2 in it. This means Sierra Ops is now technically an Early Access title. The price of the game is currently $14.99 USD which includes episodes 1 and 2. Once the full expansion patch is released, the price will be adjusted to $24.99 USD (cheaper than initially planned with episodes 2-4 as $9.99 USD x 3 DLCs). We sincerely apologise for any confusion this may have caused. More details about the game restructure here:",
