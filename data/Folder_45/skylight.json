    "About the game": "Skylight is a turn-based tactics game of colossal space battles. Comes with VR (Vive/Rift) and non-VR versions! On the bridge of your flagship, a holographic projector shows your fleet floating in space, facing the enemy and awaiting your orders. Command nimble squadrons of fighters, specialized frigates, and giant capital ships as you orchestrate your forces toward victory. The new Deluxe Edition includes new missions and ships, for a total of 15 unique ship types. Play through 36 Campaign missions, create your own in Skirmish mode, or play a Multiplayer match against your friends or a stranger. The multiplayer is turn-based, so you don't need to be online at the same time as your opponent. You can input your fleet's orders on your own time and come back to continue playing the match later! Skylight is the 3rd VR game from E McNeill, creator of the award-winning VR games Darknet and Tactera . Check out the VR Strategy Bundle to get all 3 games at a discount.",
