Occasionally, a person with the talent for magic is born there. Hunted and persecuted, such people are confined to the Sanctuaries for the Corrupted. Under the watchful eye of the Inquisition, the mages are made to work for the benefit of the state. Across the Great River from the Empire begin the Wild Lands. Once civilized, they are now roamed by predators, ghosts and demons. Dismal Marshes, Elderwood, Deceiving Plains: these lands are home to sentient non-human tribes. There is little contact and no sympathy between the Empire and these dwellers of the Wild Lands. At the feet of the Blue Mountains, in the north of the Wild Lands, rests the Spire of Sorcery. For centuries this sentient citadel slumbered, yet now it is awakened by a dark threat coming from the east. The Spire sounds an ancient Call, summoning all mages to join its cause. Answering its bidding, dozens of mages attempt to reach the Spire, attracted by the promise of a new life with the citadel. But only three succeed in crossing the Great River… ABOUT THE DEVELOPER Spire of Sorcery is created by Charlie Oscar . This is our team’s second big release.
