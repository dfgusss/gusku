Take control and play as any of the following factions: Barbarians - Chaos - Dwarves - Elves - Gadiantons - Knights - Orcs - Reptilians - Undead Heroes You'll start off each game with one Hero. Grow your reputation, by conquering enemies and castles, defeating monsters, and completing holy quests- all of which will attract more Heroes to flock to your banner. Search Ruins Heroes can search ruins, where they'll find treasure troves, powerful allies, or rare magical items. Each Hero can equip a magical weapon, armor and relic. Heroes can also embark on holy quests, where they will be tested to their limit against legendary monsters, and if victorious will receive the most renowned magical items in the game. Embark on Quests Any Hero can embark on a quest. Quests give you the ultimate test, as you battle against some of the most fearsome and powerful monsters in the game. Your reward will be worth it, as you'll find such powerful magical weapons to turn a losing war in your favor! Armies Each faction has its own unique armies, and special units. Armies can have attributes that could turn the tide of battle. Oversized units, flying units, archers, assassins, regeneration and much more for you to bring under your banner, and use to crush your enemies. With over 120 different armies in total, you'll need to decide which armies you conscript and send out to attack specific enemy units. Terrain Maps Random maps with various terrain provide a refreshing undiscovered game map with each new game. Hills, favored by the Dwarves, grant defensive bonuses. Elves favor the woods, Reptilians, the jungle. The slow, but relentless, Undead can march through Marshes without any movement penalty. Explore and find the faction that best utilizes the terrain to your advantage. Victory The world of Telestia is a homage to early strategy games, with an old-school feel, and winner takes all game. Test your might now as you explore and conquer this new, fun and mythical world!",
