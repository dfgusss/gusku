For Evalise, all she wanted was to get a bail bond for her boyfriend, when Idris surprised her with a simple but confusing question. What if you could make him forget all about you? That Which Binds Us (TWBU) is a visual novel about a young woman named Evalise whose boyfriend isn't the best guy in the world... in fact, he's constantly in jail. However, on this occasion of trying to bail him out, she runs into a bail bonds salesman who proposes a different question- what if she could make him forget about her completely? With a simple cut of his knife, he can make anyone forget about any client. Evalise, cautious but curious, goes through with it, only to find her boyfriend now completely unaware of who she is. Now, she's trying to recollect her life as a now-single woman- but a mystery still surrounds her. Over 5 hours of story Has 5 different endings Includes a new game+ which includes brand new branching paths, new endings, and the ability to read the love interest's narration Has a music, CG, and sprite art gallery",
