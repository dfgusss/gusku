    "About the game": "The battle of Visby is a visual narrative experience retelling the events that took place on the small Scandinavian island, Gotland during the summer of 1361. Visby, the islands main town is the trading centre of the North. King Valdemar Atterdag of Denmark lands his troops on the shores of Gotlands west coast. His goal is to invade Visby and rule the trading of the baltic sea. A small resistance of country yeomen decides to take up arms against the superior invaders. The story is told from a first-person perspective where the player takes roles of different characters experiencing the events that lead to the battle. It is made in Unreal Engine by a one-man team. The experience is about 1-2 hours long and focused on narrative storytelling. Design: The game is a mix of a 'walking simulator' and Quick Time Events. The player experiences the story from a first-person perspective from the eyes of different characters where the player walks around and unfolds the story by interacting with the environments as well as NPCs. The battles and action sequences are played as 'Quick time events' where the player has to push the right key to perform different actions.",
