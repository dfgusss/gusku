GAMEPLAY The players Black and White take turns. Each turn a player chooses to either place a stone on any free point of the board or to change the color of any trapped stone. A stone is trapped if at least two stones of different color lie next to it. The game ends when there is no free point left and whoever has the most stones on the board wins. CPU PLAYER You can play with a friend locally or remotely, or you can choose from three different CPU players: The Fly is the easiest AI, meant for casual players or beginners.
