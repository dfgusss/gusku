Our young sleuth Minato wastes no time getting started, and soon finds a puzzling clue to his father's whereabouts. A mysterious notebook left for him with the portentous title 'The Seven Mysteries.' With this notebook as his guide, Minato sets out on a long and difficult journey, not through space, but through time.
