    "About the game": "The Music Room is an award nominated expressive MIDI controller. It combines unique virtual reality instruments and inspiring spaces. Unlike keyboard MIDI controllers, The Music Room allows you to strum, slide, bend and drum naturally and expressively. With 8 dimensions of expressive control per note The Music Room is the most expressive MIDI controller available and supports the future of MIDI, MPE. Play carefully scanned drums and cymbals from Pearl, Ludwig, Sabian, Zildjian, DW, and Gretsch. Play drums and our 3 unique melodic instruments. All these are integrated with Bitwig 8-Track, the leading expressive audio workstation. Easily loop and record instruments from VR, select presets and launch clips. The Music Room is designed for the HTC Vive and will not work without VR hardware. The Music Room is designed as a professional musical instrument. The setup process involves installing a DAW such as Bitwig 8-Track. A download key for Bitwig 8-Track is included. Anything that accepts MIDI can be controlled. An MPE capable host is recommended and we test primarily with Bitwig Studio.",
