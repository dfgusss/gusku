While there is no fail state, there are certainly measures of success such as creating a painting that commands a high price in the online community, or owning a gallery of coveted works. Whether you are just someone who wants to doodle with a mouse or already have years of experience creating masterpieces with a drawing tablet - there is fun to be had creating and collecting in the zen coastal town of Painter's Port . Come visit Painter's Port . Stay awhile. You'll be glad you did. With slow-burning clicker-inspired progress, you will be peeling away layers for dozens of hours. Create works of digital 2D art using a multitude of tools, paints, and canvases . Gain recognition for your efforts through the online community through ‘thumbs up’ artwork appreciation votes and/or selling your work. Manage your own gallery to ensure you have the most coveted collection of curated works; buy, sell, and vote on community-created works of art. Earn Renown (XP) through painting idle clicker-style, and Bits (money) from gallery sales. Spend these currencies on permanent upgrades, a variety of canvases, new painting tools, paint colors, votes on your favorite paintings in The Community Harbor, and much more. Invest Renown into progressing through 50 levels as a career artist. The unlock system caters to creative gamers that enjoy a slow-burning ‘lifestyle’ game.
