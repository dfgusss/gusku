    "About the game": "Those Who Came is a cooperative adventure with some touch of RPG where you will have to work as a team to survive and thrive on a hostile planet. You are one of the last Sainen, a strong and resilient species, once a peaceful civilization of spacefarers and explorers, who nearly faced extinction after their planet collapsed. Hoping for their kind to survive this cataclysmic event, they sent forth a ship full of explorers, frozen in a cryogenic state. After some years, the ship Hermaion detects a suitable planet. And thus, your mission begins: to heal the deadly planet of Solarus and build a new home. However, you soon discovered that the planet was already inhabited by the Torek, a species native to Solarus, who survived the harsh environment of the planet. By working together, both Torek and Sainen can help bring the planet back to life, forging a deep and strong connection in the process. As a Sainen, survive in Solarus at your own style by using the different shapers and energies: Airy, Ether, Fire and Jointer. Explore the world and find the suits that you need to heal it back. KEY FEATURES FOR FULL RELEASE Choose your own style by using the energy with the different shapers: Airy, Ether, Fire and Jointer. Explore and find the different suits to interact with the world and restore life in Solarus to turn it into your new home. The more you heal, the better it gets. By caring for the planet, you will be able to face the final challenge with some advantages. Play either alone or along with your friends, into a campaign with plenty of challenges to stop Bineok and his final experiment. Dive into our Arcade mode, where you can face your friends in competitive PVP arenas. Harness the versatility of all 4 energies using them creatively on other players.",
