The player become legendary guardian spirit, 'Munch'. Hunts enemies and can eat them to increase their fullness meter. If you eat enough, you will grow in size! Your size and fullness then also functions as a magic meter that you can spend for various effects like healing yourself or casting powerful magic like fireball! Becoming bigger has both pros and cons. Your punch will become much more powerful at larger sizes along with increased damage resistance from your bouncy full body! However, becoming bigger also means you are a bigger target for enemies to hit. Also, certain types of enemy attacks are piercing, dealing extra damage to your full tight body, so be careful! There is a diverse cast of people to be found on the island. Explore the island and talk to them. Rescuing people helps your tiny village grow, making it a popular place to be. They can provide useful information and help you on your journey. There is a large array of enemies blocking your path. Tribal Hunter has 9 different zones, each having its own enemy set and visual style. Explore each of them to save your village! The fate of the island is in your hands! No adventure is complete without a bit of challenge though, each zone has its own unique boss which will stand in your way and test your might! They may be challenging, but that makes your victory all the more satisfying! (Some boss have some 'unusual' way to defeat :D ) But adventuring isn’t ALL you do… Every hero’s journey needs some downtime, though the island’s people may have unique ideas for how to spice things up. Play a humorous minigame for additional rewards! Munch is enjoying this………… probably…. Travel through the island, help the villagers and discover the hidden secret of the island. Can you beat all the challenges and save your tribe?",
