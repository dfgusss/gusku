    "About the game": "Killer Queen took the arcade world by storm. Killer Queen Black brought the battle home. And now... ZOMBEEZ: A Killer Queen Remix heralds the first single-player Killer Queen adventure! Built directly on top of the Killer Queen engine, ZOMBEEZ: A Killer Queen Remix takes the skills and techniques found in Killer Queen and applies them to an entirely new experience, full of never-before-seen enemies and challenges. As the titular hero, Abs , you'll run, fly, and slay your way through the undead horde as you head towards a fated showdown with the terrifying, all-powerful Blood Queen! EXPLORATION - Make your way through brand-new, randomly generated worlds that will keep each playthrough feeling unique and challenging! Play on one-of-a-kind battlefields that are generated daily, monthly, or every time you die (which will probably be a lot.) ARCADE-STYLE SCORING - What's the point of being good at something if you can't show off? Prove your might with Daily Challenges, and earn some sorely-needed bragging rights with Global Leaderboards! You may not have the high score today, but tomorrow's level could be a whole different story. BATTLE-TESTED GAMEPLAY - Using the Killer Queen engine, ZOMBEEZ: A Killer Queen Remix will feel familar to Killer Queen veterans while staying accessible to newcomers. You want me to say the thing? Yeah, I'll say it -- EASY TO LEARN, DIFFICULT TO MASTER. KEEP YOUR SKILLS SHARP - Kick berries, ride the snail, and take to the skies in aerial combat! A LITTLE BACKSTORY ON BUMBLEBEAR AND THIS GAME Over the years, we at BumbleBear Games have striven to be the vanguards of the modern arcade. We've put over 150 Killer Queen machines into arcades, bars, and rec rooms across the country, with millions of games played. Our games are all about physically bringing people together, face to face—which at the present moment, is obviously not possible. When COVID-19 started sweeping across the globe, the arcade scene was (and continues to be) heavily impacted by the closing of bars/arcades and the implementation of social distancing. This left both our company and the Killer Queen community in a rough spot, so we set out to create something unique that would help bring our players closer together while we all navigate the difficulties of quarantined life. That's how we came up with ZOMBEEZ: A Killer Queen Remix , the fast-paced, high-flying, single-player 2D platformer based in the Killer Queen universe. We hope you enjoy our first single-player Killer Queen adventure!",
