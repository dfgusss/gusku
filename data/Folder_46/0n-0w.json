    "About the game": "A destination to explore, full of sights and sounds for the curious voyager. The unknown might seem all encompassing at first, but walk in any direction and familiarity will lead you home. It is said a hundred dimensions exist, some large others small. Intertwined by a legion of doors with wayward intentions. Somewhere an elusive ending meanders about, will you find it? A first person peaceful adventure suitable for all ages ; There's no violence or scary things :) This is not a guided tale, but an introspective journey exploring a vast dimension. There's no 'traditional' gameplay Photosensitive epileptic seizures warning!
