    "About the game": "In 3x64 you will try to connect blocks of the same colors on the constantly changing game board. Every direction of gravity has a unique active color - destroying blocks of the same color guarantees you one of many mighty powerups . Gravity is changing faster and faster, and you should always be prepared for bigger challenges! In 3x64 you can get many types of powerups. You have 3 slots for basic powerups - these can be easily earned by destroying active color blocks. Then you can use them whenever you want , or you can wait and craft much more powerful ones - the choice is yours! Altogether there are 16 powerups in the game, including those that manipulate blocks, time, and strategic minigames such as arkanoid and shooting. Apart from the basic color blocks, two additional types of blocks will make your game more challenging. Iron blocks spawn every so often, and can be destroyed only using powerups. Threat blocks hide a random negative effect - but you have some time to destroy them before they activate. After the game ends, you can share how well you control gravity with other players in online leaderboards. Your current position in the leaderboards is always displayed during the game. You can easily pick the game up on your own, but the game contains an interactive tutorial which can make your start even easier.",
