The game Alone consists of a camp menu, where you can manage your inventory, craft, go hunting etc. and an overworld where you can collect resources for your camp and find new and interesting locations. The game is a trial and error type of game and it also has a few puzzles to solve during the story. Will you be rescued or will you starve to death? We will see... Cool little game, quite a different experience. -GPVReviews Features ♦ Elegant, Minimalistic Pixel Art ♦ Many Items to Find ♦ Over 2 Hours of Gameplay ♦ Achievements ♦ 2 Difficulties: Hard and Extreme ♦ Mostly Randomized Gameplay",
