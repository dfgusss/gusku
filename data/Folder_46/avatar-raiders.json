Let your viewers join via your chat, throw emotes or grenades and compete together against a mighty army of super cute zombies. Attention! You must be a Twitch broadcaster to use this product! Usage: You can include Avatar Raiders as a transparent overlay in your broadcaster software, as well as display it as a full-screen game. Just select the appropriate background scene for your lobby and match, and you're ready to go. No matter if you want to stream the game permanently or if you want to start a match with your viewers only at certain times. The control is yours. Avatar Raiders is also available as a category on Twitch, by the way. Viewer integration: Avatar Raiders connects to your Twitch chat. Your viewers can join a round via chat commands. During the preparation phase, teammates can equip themselves with grenades and use them during the fight. Procedure: A round runs in two phases. Phase 1, Preparation. Your spectators join the game and equip themselves while the countdown displays the remaining time. If you wish, the game characters can also react to chatemotes from the players during this time and throw them in the air. Phase 2, Defense. Teammates advance in waves of a maximum of 10 defenders each and try to stop the advancing zombie hordes. Who will manage to eliminate the most zombies and secure the settlement? Spectators can control when to throw a grenade of their character via chat. At the end of a game round, the points scored are posted once again in the chat.",
