    "About the game": "Let’s break it down with Beat Souls! A high-speed rhythm game where you have to avoid obstacles and collect the titular Beat Souls to wrack up a stylish combo and go for the high-score! Lay the Rhythm Yokai to rest with awesome dance moves as you put on a killer performance! Features Cyberpop visuals! Colorful and cute anime aesthetic meets neon cyberpunk vibe to create Cyberpop! Action and Rhythm collide! Master the elegant dance of dodging and jumping out of the way of oncoming obstacles while simultaneously moving your Otomo companion to collect Beat Souls to really get that combo soaring! Colliding with Noise will throw off your groove, resetting your combo, and draining your stamina. When that stamina hits 0, its game over… Keep dancing until the end to pacify the Rhythm Yokai and clear the stage! Variety of stages await you! There are more than 30 stages available in the game! In addition, you can select the difficulty level for each stage, so you can enjoy the gameplay that suits your skill level. Gameplay Dancing Dodge left or right, or Jump and avoid the noise (obstacles) that fly in rhythm with the music. To really master the game, you have to learn to move your character, Mikoto, while moving your Otomo companion to collect the Beat Souls. Dodge side to side and jump to avoid incoming danger while moving your Otomo across the screen to collect the incoming Beat Souls. Noisy Rhythm Yokai The obstacles the Rhythm Yokai send at you are called “Noise”. You’ll have to jump over and dodge them as they come in all shapes and sizes. Colliding with Noise will throw off your groove, resetting your combo, and draining your stamina. When that stamina hits 0, its game over… Keep dancing until the end to pacify the Rhythm Yokai and clear the stage! The Otomo Companion Your 2 floating Otomo companions are the key to collecting Beat Souls! They’re the key to boosting your score. Move them to either side of the screen or keep them in the centre as you try to maintain the ideal formation to catch all the incoming Beat Souls. Just between you and me, the real secret is you have to change your Otomo’s color to match the Beat Soul while you’re trying to collect, otherwise *poof* they’ll pass right through you! About the game world Mikoto is the star of this show. She is a legendary Shrine Maiden with impeccable dance moves that she uses to commune with the mysterious Rhythm Yokai. The constant hustle and bustle of the big cities has driven the Rhythm Yokai from all over into a frenzy. It is up to Mikoto to dance through their noise and soothe their restless spirits! 'This is where I come in! My splendid dance will blow away all the Yokai’s stress!' Introducing the 'Beat Souls' and 'Noise'! Beat Souls “Beat Souls” are yellow and blue, and are shaped like human souls. Players control their Otomo characters to catch the oncoming Beat Souls. The Otomo character can be moved left and right, and its color can be switched Yellow or Blue. If you catch a Beat Soul of the same color, you'll get points to add to your score! Be careful, though, because if a beat soul touches the player, you'll take damage and your combo will be broken! Noise Loud sounds stress youkai and form “Noise”. Like the Beat Soul, if you touch it, it will damage and break combos when it comes into contact with the player. The shorter and taller noises will come at you, so avoid them by jumping or moving side to side! Introducing three important elements in Score Attack! Fever Time When you catch a Beat Soul, your 'Fever Gauge' will increase. If you enter a fever time section while maintaining a certain amount of the gauge, it becomes fever time and the score you can earn will increase. When aiming for a high score, try to be aware of fever time! Character Customization As you progress through the game, you'll be able to unlock and select other characters to challenge the stages. Each character has a special 'skill' assigned to them, so use them well and aim for a high score! Infinite Hell Mode (HELL MODE) In this mode, there are three stages, one for each of the three Yokai characters. In this mode, the music continues endlessly, and you can test your skills to see how long you can last to achieve the high score. If you fail to catch the Beat Soul or hit a Noise, your 'Excite Gauge' will decrease. When it reaches zero, the game is over. This mode supports rankings, so compete with players from around the world for the high score!
