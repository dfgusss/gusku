    "About the game": "WHAT'S THIS? A REMAKE OF ASTEROIDS FROM 1979? Well, as asteroids are one of the best games of all time , we wanted to make a worthy successor 40 years after the initial release of the classic game. Bigwig Flint is developed over 5 years with lots of love put into every level, made for hardcore gamers . But it isn't a remake even though it still has the sexy triangle as the hero and there are vicious asteroids and spaceships. So yes, it is a top down shooter but not an asteroids clone - it's Kanselsprot Entertainment paying tribute to a classic game with their own take on a top down shooter. FEATURES - Advance through multifarious levels - Fight with Epic Bosses - Collect XP and level up your weapons and skills - Enjoy highly responsive controls - Find hidden levels and bonuses - STEAM Achievements - Experience the in-house created physics based universe FOR: - brutal hardcore, retro gaming-lovers - asteroids lovers - non-asteroids lovers NOT FOR: - weak-minded - haters",
