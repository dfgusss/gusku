    "About the game": "Bounce off logs, fences, roller coasters, and whatever else you can find to pop as many bubbles as you can. Or turn on Dodge Mode to make popping a bubble result in a loss. Play on six unique levels, each with twists to keep the gameplay fresh. Or if that's not enough, unlock modes that change up the gameplay even more. Please note that this game is designed for multiple people. Playing the game in single player would be a great way to get used to the game, but playing without another person will make the game get very dull rather quickly. So play Bubble Bounce today! Or maybe watch some gameplay or the trailer and decide based on that instead of a vague description.",
