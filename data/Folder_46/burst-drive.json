    "About the game": "Burst Drive is just about blowing up colorful aliens and seeing how far you can go before getting overwhelmed. DEEP DIVE Steer your fighter and boost around! Drift, line 'em up and fire away ! Shooting generates heat ! Collect and buy extra cooling or drift to release the excess heat. Dash around! Double-tap boost for a short, evasive maneuver. One shot, one kill! If you are hit without your shields, you'll lose a life. Disengage until your AEGIS shields quickly recover. Upgrade your ship via the shop between sectors. Buy items for your dash, extra shields, weapons and more! 50 levels that repeat and get harder with each loop in different ways. Slain the boss? Get ready for the real action! Optional two-player local co-op with extra controllers or from the same keyboard! Or use your mouse to aim and steer! Have it your way! Steam Leaderboards! Colorful graphics and lots of explosions! Can you beat all 50 levels? Then maybe go a little further for a real challenge? ;)",
