    "About the game": "Welcome to the future of shared gaming spaces. We believe that there should be no bar to entry into the Metaverse, your platform shouldn’t limit that either. With canVERSE up to 64 players are seamlessly connected across desktop, AR &amp; VR, with voice-chat, all in realtime. Whilst at heart canVERSE aims to host really good looking table-top games, its true purpose is to connect friends and communities globally in an immersive, totally interoperable shared spaces. Allowing friends to hang out together. The ‘Genesis’ game for canVERSE is Chess, an ever relevant fundamental past-time that has continued its popularity for countless generations. This ancient and unchanging game transcends language and locale and has become almost culturally ubiquitous. With chess we found the perfect starting block for canVERSE and utilising bleeding edge technology such as Stockfish AI, HDRP and PBRs we are able to deliver an almost lifelike game. The canVERSE has already been in development for over a year, however the journey has only just begun. Chess is only the first board game, more are planned to be launched. If you want to be a part of the community shaping this journey, there is no better time to join than now.",
