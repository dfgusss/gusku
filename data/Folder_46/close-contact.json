    "About the game": "Close Contact is a short (approx 1-1.5 hours), sci-fi horror game where the player must navigate an advanced underground base whilst occasionally avoiding the alien creature that stalks you. As a new employee of the mega corporation Abbotsfield Corp, you have arrived on Cadmus, a planet far from Earth. Once home to an ancient alien civilization, you have been sent to support the research team. However, upon waking from your long cryo sleep, you discover that something has gone horribly, fatally wrong in the base beneath the surface. Set in the distant future, advanced contact lenses are now commonplace, and are used as one of the main forms of computing. Owing to the specific light frequency emitted, the alien inside the base is able to sense when you are nearby. Your only hope for survival is to keep your eyes closed and not get too close. Features Narrative driven cinematic experience An incredible and chilling soundtrack composed by Matthew Javanshir Immersive sound effects Voice logs with subtitles Between 1 and 1.5 hours playtime Made with Unity.",
