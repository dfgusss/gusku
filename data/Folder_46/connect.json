    "About the game": "&gt;Connect is a hacking simulator which takes inspiration from real hacking tools and processes but implements them in an intuitive, easy to play and beginner-friendly way. Dive deep into a world of cyberhacking and break into hundreds of computers in order to uncover secrets held by greedy corporations and of course self-profit along the way. It's up to the player to choose whether he wants to use his power to help people or just score great riches for himself. Features Immersion - &gt;Connect is designed with full player immersion in mind. With no obvious 'gamey' mechanics like levels, the player is thrown into a realistic operating system in which he can do anything without anyone holding him by a hand. Multiple Endings - Some of the missions allow you to change the fate of other people's lifes depending on your decisions. Secrets - &gt;Connect has many secret files and minigames for the players to collect. Happy hunting!",
