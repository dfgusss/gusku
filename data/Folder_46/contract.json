    "About the game": "'Contract' is a 2D side-scrolling action platformer. You are the chosen one, the legendary hero―and you have successfully defeated the greatest evil of the land, the Demon King. Now you're going on a well-deserved vacation at a remote, peaceful village. That is, it should have been peaceful―but for some mysterious reason, monsters are reappearing in the village, and you are tasked by the village elder to dispatch them at the source, the eastern cave at the edge of town. But this was supposed to be a vacation! Of course you didn't think to pack any swords along with your hawaiian shirt. Luckily, the elder will lend you the magical sword―a precious artifact of the village―on condition that you fill out a contract. Something about it being a, you know, precious artifact. Anyways, you enter the dungeon to defeat all those monsters―but you can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. The monsters seem endless, even as you cut through them, room after room... Will you be able to figure out the mystery behind this 'contract' and sudden monsters? Features: ☆ Enjoy simple &amp; clean pixel graphics ☆ Uncover the twist by defeating the dungeon &amp; its formidable boss ☆ Build your best strategy―negotiate the pros and cons of the contract ☆ Feel the sheer thrill of slicing through enemies ☆ Supports both Windows &amp; MacOS",
