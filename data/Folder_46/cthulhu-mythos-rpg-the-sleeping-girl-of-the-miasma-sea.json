Depending on who you choose, the experience you have may change drastically. [New Game Plus] When the story proceeds you have the option to exit the mansion at any time. If you run out of healing items or the enemies are just far too strong... you can give up, go home and attempt to explore the mansion from the beginning with your current level. (You can do this even if you are defeated in battle = Game Over.) Also, by unlocking certain achievements in game, the protagonist will gain a bonus to their parameters when you start a new game. Take one step back and two steps forward. Giving up and starting over is an essential element to eventually discovering the truth...",
