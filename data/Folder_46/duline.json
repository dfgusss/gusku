    "About the game": "Duline is a pure and simple logic game, expressing unexpected complexity through its level design. 31 unique levels. The game is quite challenging so be prepared. Rules: You can place blue or orange blocks anywhere except white tiles. The goal is to cover all the green tiles on the board with the least 'chains' used. A chain is when blocks of the same colour touch in the main cardinal directions. Chains over 12 in length are invalid!",
