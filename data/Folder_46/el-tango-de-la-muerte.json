You must help him learn to dance, and win the heart of Martita, the love of his life.

Features Easy to pick up and learn – Anyone can learn how to play the game in seconds! Move Luciano in four directions, one tile at a time, or sliding through several at a time – always following the rhythm of the song. Each new song brings a new move you can learn.
