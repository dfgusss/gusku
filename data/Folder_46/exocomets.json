    "About the game": "Exocomets is a basic yet difficult action game where you try to survive as long as possible against incoming waves of comets. One hit, and your ship is dead. You have a simple task: survive for 100 seconds. To do this, you must unlock and utilize various powerups. Along with powerups, stars can be found floating across the universe. Be sure to pick them up to give your powerups a boost! As you go deeper into the universe throughout levels, more powerups will help you, but more comets will appear, and faster. Good luck trying to beat the game! Music by Ethan 'ethanpiedude' Pesikoff, Mark 'marchimedes' Trautner, Andy 'KeyboardFire' Tockman, and Matthew 'matthewpipie' Giordano. Like our facebook!
