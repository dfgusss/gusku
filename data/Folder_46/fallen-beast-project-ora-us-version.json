Each chapter will show of the adventure you must take through hidden areas of the Earth as you struggle to prepare for the last day, the Day of the Beast! * Intense Old School battles with limitless Super Abilities that you will have to earn through combat, skill, common sense and bloodshed on the battlefield. * Face off against tough Bosses that can end your game quickly but remember, just because they're bigger than you doesn't mean they do not have a weakness. * Travel through areas not of this world but beware, one move can destroy your existence and cause you great pain in failure, be cautious, deadly traps galore such as lava pits, spiked boulders and electricity - charged devices can quickly end your journey if you don't approach the situation seriously. * Don't go into the battle alone! Face challenging foes with your alley as she not only assist you in battle but also keeps you alive every step of the way. * Use the 'Double Complexity Command' system (allows you to play as the Main Character while commanding another for assistance) to use magic and attacks from both characters. * Need a boost? Visit the Magic Shop to purchase something that will give you a fighting chance. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Fallen Beast was designed to be played with the Keyboard. (WASD, ETC) The game has no Set Difficulty so, prepare to be challenged continuously. There is a SAVE GAME option however, the game was designed to only save data when the computer is ON. Cutting your computer off will delete your saved information for security reasons. (Any type of virus scanning, malware prevention or other software keeping your computer clean will see Fallen Beast 'Saves' as a threat to your system and could automatically delete the game data itself. This has caused issues during testing) There is a backup for such an action, Fallen Beast contains a small Password System that allows you to play each chapter's areas once they've been reached. Hope you enjoy.",
