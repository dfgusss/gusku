    "About the game": "Once a stranger with a black cat came to the quiet and calm town of Packord Glow, and with them trouble came. A flock of black ravens circled over the city ... And the Fire came! More and more often houses began to light up. An alarm sounds every minute in the fire department. Firefighters are sorely lacking. People in panic leave their homes and leave the city. Fire, like a living creature, spreads through the city, capturing the territory. The city will soon become a ghost. Don't let this happen. Join the ranks of glorious firefighter heroes! Go the hard way of a firefighter, from trainee to head of department, saving the city from a natural disaster. Fight with fire, collect bucks, upgrade the fire department, unlock new levels and improve skills until the entire city is consumed by fire. Go trainee! Your time has gone! P.S. Be attentive, avoid dangerous traps. AND… Helicopter to help you! In the near future, a patch will be released that will add several levels to the existing ones.",
