Your goal is to help Glowfly to collect all bonuses on the level and reach the finish by placing different blocks on its way. In the beginning this game will resemble some puzzle, but next levels are almost mind-blowing – you need good reaction to win! More than 75 levels divided into chapters with unique gameplay features, hand-drawn art, ambient soundtrack – it definitely won't leave you indifferent!",
