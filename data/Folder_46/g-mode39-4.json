    "About the game": "There is something we must protect with everything we have. We will once again confront the dark clouds of fate that surround us. The Flyhight Cloudia series is popular as a full-fledged mobile RPG. The latest title, 'Flyhight Cloudia 4', depicts the mysteries of the inexplicable events that have begun to occur one after another in the empty world of Cloudia, and the bonds between the people caught up in them. This title is the first in the G-MODE Archives to support the 'wide screen' feature. Instead of the traditional square screen, you can enjoy the aerial adventure on a large, powerful screen. The battle system uses the same multi-weight battle system that has been used in the series. You can enjoy highly strategic battles with easy controls, and a convenient 'AUTO' mode is also available. The game also features a convenient 'AUTO' mode, which allows you to enjoy battles with lower-ranked enemies without stress and immerse yourself in the story. ■ About G-MODE Archives The G-MODE Archives is a reissue project that faithfully recreates old feature phone games as they were back then. In order to enjoy the app as it was back then, the web-connected menu, buttons, and keys have been transplanted, but some of them may not work. For more information on the Steam version, press START button and see the 'How to play' in the PAUSE menu.",
