Choose your character: Choose between three unique player characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and a powerful signature throw. Choose your Arena: Select from 5 distinct court setups at launch, with their own arrangement of goals, score boosts and obstacles that change the layout of the Gyrodisc Super League Arena. Gameplay Using all the moves at your disposal is key to victory in Gyrodisc Super League! Run, dive, catch and throw to keep the disc out of your goal and send it soaring towards your opponent’s.
