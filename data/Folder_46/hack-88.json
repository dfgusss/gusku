    "About the game": "You are the elusive hacker, edie88, and your job is to bring down the corrupt owner of Waylife Bank by guiding your trusty partner in anti-crime, Bit, into the mainframe of a 1988 bank's computer system and revealing the fraudulent transactions of CEO Peter Mohw. Power your way through 11 computer systems, totaling 88 levels of increasing difficulty and speed. Swing from point to point, revealing the data in the code and avoiding the anti-invasion programs, ranging from simple electrified walls to vicious spider-like assailants. Fire your pulse shot to destroy them, or to reveal the hidden lights for a moment to aide you in your quest. The better you perform in each system, the more upgrades you earn, not only to spruce up Bit with new colors, but gain useful improvements to your abilities. The three-button control scheme seems simple at first, but may prove a greater challenge than you expected. Features: - Difficult controls that are rewarding to master - 88 Levels of varying difficulty - Several upgrades, both colorful and mechanical - Fun patterns and intense challenge levels - Obstacles and enemies of all sorts - Engaging story",
