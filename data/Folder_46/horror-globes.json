    "About the game": "All the villages have stories about the town or its inhabitants. Stories about ghosts, haunted houses, crimes,... Stories of implausible things that an acquaintance claims to have lived, but no one has ever seen. However, what happens here is manifested on a daily basis. Those bloody footprints with deformed nails appear without warning and drive the animals crazy. Recently several horses ran amok and appeared in the vicinity of the forest open in channel. The viscera was intact but all the bones were missing, I don't know what kind of creature can do this with such precision. Horror Globes is a short first-person horror adventure with special attention to spatial sound and atmospheric Halloween. It belongs to a collection of short horror stories contained in collectible snow globes. Do you dare to disturb your nightmares? Immerse yourself into the atmosphere of this story as you explore an old property set apart during the night of Halloween.
