    "About the game": "HotHead is a retro-style platforming shooter game. Game Modes Choose between two game modes: 'Arcade Mode and 'Stage Mode.' In 'Arcade Mode' you will have to progress through all of the stages with a limited number of lives. 'Stage Mode' allows you to play the game at your own pace. Each stage has three letters: 'H,' 'O,' and 'T.' Collecting all three will gets you a 'HOT Bonus.' In 'Arcade Mode' the 'Hot Bonus' will grant you an extra life. In 'Stage Mode' it will add your current power-ups to your inventory. Different Ways to Play HotHead can be played with either a keyboard and mouse setup or with a game controller. With the game controller, there are two control options: Single joystick or dual joystick gameplay. Power-Ups There are two types of power-ups in HotHead. One modifies your attack, while the other grants you a bonus effect. There are four power-ups of each type. You can only hold one of each type at a time. In 'Stage Mode' you can collect power-ups by completing stages and getting the 'Hot Bonus.' These power-ups will go in your inventory where you can select which power-ups you want to use before selecting a stage. High Scores &amp; Speed Runs Each stage has a goal score and time to beat. If you obtain the goals for each world you will be rewarded with a bonus for 'Stage Mode.'",
