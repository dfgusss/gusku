    "About the game": "Hypermind is a combination-based first-person puzzle game. We have designed four abilities: Apply Velocity, Lock, Enlarge, and Anti-gravity. This allows players to make full use of their imagination to discover more possibilities for solving puzzles. Velocity To remotely move Cubes or press controllers by applying a velocity to the target. Lock To fix the Cube in a certain position or to keep the controller pressed/released. Enlarge To double the size and mass of a Cube. Anti-gravity To reverse the direction of gravity of the Cube. Advanced Lock To lock the status of a Cube, so the player may cast Enlarge/Anti-gravity on another Cube. Combinations of Abilities You can combine the Abilities in any way you want, thus allowing various approaches to solving the puzzles. Self-casting Most Abilities can be used on yourself. You can move, lock, enlarge yourself like you do a cube.",
