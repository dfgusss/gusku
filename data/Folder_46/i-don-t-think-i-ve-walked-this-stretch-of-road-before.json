    "About the game": "A short narrative adventure game by hexcavator . Walk the length of your memories on a lonely country highway. Follow the signal. Return to the place you left behind. Piece together a truth you can live with. Gameplay - Just walk : Traverse a dreamy backroad littered with fragments from your past. - Point-and-click : Explore vignettes and manipulate objects to gather snippets of prose. - Thrills without chills : Reconstruct a hopeful story of personal reckoning. - Low stakes : No combat or failure state. Move at your own pace and let curiosity guide you. - Compact : &lt; 30 minutes to play through. Features -Surreal, minimalistic 3D landscape -Guitars + brooding analog synth ambience -Shameless Jeff Nichols/Kelly Reichardt/David Lynch worship -Lo-fi, low-poly, no-budget psychodrama -Dual analog or keyboard input Errata I don't think I've walked this stretch of road before is a mashup of homespun 3D design, pulsating electronic sounds, and my desire to tell humanizing, hopeful stories about struggling to make sense of pain. It was built haltingly over about a year and a half using some tools I know well &amp; others I barely understand. I was inspired throughout by the small but resilient community of people using Gamemaker: Studio for 3D development. Like any commercial framework, GM:S has its caveats, but I appreciate its primordial, open-ended toolset, and I hope this game can be a small but interesting contribution to the scene. More than anything, I hope it weirds you out for a little while, and maybe offers a bit of respite from grimly uncertain times.",
