    "About the game": "Identity is a new breed of massively multiplayer online role-playing game where hundreds of players interact in a world of absolute freedom. It's the actions of players which determine your fate and the fate of the world you live in. When everyone is a real person, you can live as a criminal, a police officer, business person or anything in between. You are in full control of your own future in your pursuit of wealth, glory and power. Identity takes place in a fictional land in the eastern United States, inspired primarily by the Carolinas and Georgia. The chosen location allows for a huge variety in terrain and environments. You'll encounter dirty cities, beautiful beaches, farmland, snow-capped mountains and everything in between. All of these areas are inspired by real locations in the United States, resulting in an incredibly believable and immersive world. The Town Square The Town Square is the first Identity module, which also includes access to future modules and the full Identity game upon its completion. As a social module, the Town Square will allow you to create and customize your characters, meet new friends and enjoy a bunch of interesting and fun things to do. This is your first preview of what's to come with Identity! Identity's Town Square, a closed-off section of the Ash Hill city center, gives you a sneak peek at some of the items you've received from pledging to Identity. With a few dozen people per town square server, you can hang out and play games with other Identity fans while waiting on future modules and the full Identity world. Following the Town Square, two additional modules will be released: SWAT and Racing . After all modules are playable, you'll get access to the Identity game as a whole.",
