There, you'll need to bear the onslaught of ruthless rebels while keeping your benefactor happy and explore the ruins of a forgotten civilization. The Council expects much from you. Do you have what it takes to truly thrive? BUILD AND MANAGE YOUR CITY On Titan, precious construction materials and technological artifacts are locked away in ancient, massive ruins. Use these materials and artifacts to construct roads and transportation, build residences for citizens, power your city, and generate profits.

Build a variety of devices inside your factories for smaller scale investments Set up processors that can refine your resources to exponentially increase their value Get creative with your factory layouts to optimize floor efficiency STRIKE DOWN YOUR ENEMIES Your city’s success will undoubtedly draw the attention and ire of those around you.
