    "About the game": "Take the role of a virus infecting multiple organs in your host. Outsmart and outrun the immune system. Collect DNA and use them to mutate, grow stronger and gain new abilities. Spawn viral clones to speed up your work. Compete with other microorganisms to be the dominant pathogenic species. And discover a beautiful microscopic world on a cellular level. Game Features Unlock different types of viruses (including an alien-like virus originated from space) with their own unique abilities. Immune cells that mimic real-life immune response behavior. Multiple upgrades and mutation abilities to give you an edge over your host's immune system. Observe how viruses overwhelm the host's body on a cellular level. The good news is that you don't need to be a microbiologist to enjoy this game! INFECTIOUS is developed by a solo indie developer.",
