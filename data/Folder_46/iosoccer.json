    "About the game": "IOSoccer is a free non-commercial competitive third-person online multiplayer soccer game that offers unparalleled freedom in ball control and gameplay depth. Originally released 15 years ago under the full name International Online Soccer as a Half-Life mod, the game was later ported to the Source Engine and re-released in 2008. Since the last public release, the game’s code has been completely rewritten, new player models created, and countless new gameplay features added. Features: Unparalleled freedom in ball control and gameplay depth : The combination of a third-person camera together with mouse and keyboard input gives you full control over your dribbling, shooting, and passing. Skill moves : Show your mastery of the game with bicycle kicks, diving headers, ball flicks, and precision dribbling. Flexible team sizes : Whether you prefer 4v4 street games or our standard 8v8 matchups, we support everything from 1 to 11 players per side. AI and human goalkeepers : You can let the server control the keeper or take its position yourself on the fly. Public matches : Join and leave public servers with casual matches whenever you want to. Competitive matches : Participate with your club, national team or mix team in leagues and cups organized by the community. Dedicated servers : Use our official dedicated servers or rent your own one from a hoster of your choice. Player customization : Set your shirt name, pick your shirt number and choose your ethnicity, hair style, shoes, keeper gloves, ball, and sleeve length. Instant replays and highlights : Watch goals again from the TV camera's perspective right after they happened and use intermissions to catch up on chances you missed. Goal celebrations : Choreograph your team's goal celebrations with various animations. Warm up mode : Practice shots on your own goalkeeper during warm up before the match where every player has their own ball. Custom assets : Make your own maps, team kits, balls, shoes, and keeper gloves. 100% free : No microtransactions or any other hidden costs.",
