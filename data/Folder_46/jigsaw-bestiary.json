    "About the game": "There are thousands of monsters detailed in legends from every region of the planet. You may not know them all, but they are among us, lurking through the cracks in the roof to the lock on the bedroom door. In Jigsaw Bestiary you will meet six creatures that have lived for centuries or even millennia hiding in the shadows and the true mythology behind each one. Quibungo - Terrible devourer of children, especially disobedient ones. Werewolf - Human able to turn into a wolf on a full moon night. Sylvans - Human-animal hybrids, like the pig-faced woman. Striga - Female vampire-like demon. Djinn - Creatures made of smokeless fire that live in a parallel dimension. Lamia - Female succubus-like demon. Set up the jigsaw puzzle scenes at five different levels of difficulty. Beautiful illustrations created especially for the game by artist Alexandre Rocha (@semdizer). Play this game if you like monster stories, you will surely love to know a little more about these creatures!",
