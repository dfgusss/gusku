    "About the game": "Yes, you are only a human being. But no, you are not mortal. As a dark lord and the future master of this universe, you signed a contract with a super-strong demon of the void. Because of your great mental strength, the demon failed to obtain your figure. So now you've got his power and began your path to your destiny. But your enemy is not only the Saint Lord, king of the holy land but also yourself. The demon in you hasn't given up your figure. 'Jump To Die 2 - Bloody Soul' is almost completely different from 'Jump To Die!!'. It's still an idle game . But we don't care about 'cash' anymore. This time, the whole universe is in danger. And you are the one who is going to bring destruction to the world. You play as a demon lord who is born a human. You will build a dark castle and summon demons to defeat the warriors from the holy land. Build your building. It expands automatically. So don't worry. Just build up; Summon demons and control them. They work for you. They fight for you; Invade holy land. Kill all saint warriors. Destroy the Saint Lord - Reborn; Level up your room and magic; Travel through time and space, be stronger; Cross the void, be much stronger; Oh, now you have nothing to do? Did you see those humans been jumping off the roof? Now get your hands away from the keyboard. Watch them die.",
