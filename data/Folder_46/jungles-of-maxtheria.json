Note: The game always starts off in black so it can do a nice fade up from black into the main menu. However, the very first time playing the game, it may stay on black for a while before the main menu pops up. Don't panic! This is the game engine figuring out how your system is set up (screen resolution, graphics card, etc.). The next time you run the game, the time in black should be real fast. If you like the old school Atari VCS 2600 games, such as Activision's Pitfall , then you will love Jungles of Maxtheria . This is updated and improved for your gaming pleasure.",
