    "About the game": "Jupiter Hell is a classic, turn-based roguelike set in a 90s flavored sci-fi universe. Set on the moons of Jupiter, the game pits a lone space marine against overwhelming demonic forces. Rip and tear zombies, demons and unmentionable monstrosities, using classic weaponry such as shotguns, chainguns, railguns and the trusty chainsaw. All to the shine of CRT monitors and the tune of heavy metal! Tactical, turn-based combat Benefit from classic roguelike turns with modern shooter sensibilities and real-time responsiveness. Controls are immediate and accessible while retaining the back-end depth of a turn-based RPG. Play with mouse+keyboard, keyboard-only, or gamepad controls. Spiritual successor to DOOM Roguelike Jupiter Hell is built by ChaosForge, the team that’s been making top-down, cosmic hell roguelikes since 2002, when DOOM, the Roguelike (later renamed DRL ) filled the screens with ASCII-based, gory, explosive action and defined the turn-based shooter genre. Meaningful RPG progression Customize your character with new weapons, items and abilities gained as you progress through a permadeath-prone hell. Each run you build your character anew, and every unlocked perk can change the way you play. Beat the game to unlock more difficult challenges rather than grinding to make the game easier. Randomized levels set all over Jupiter’s orbit Blast through procedurally-generated civilian sectors, military space bases and mining colonies on the violent moons of Jupiter. Every playthrough you’ll find new ways to experience familiar environments. Pair that with detailed graphics and smooth animation. Roguelikes have come a long way from their ASCII roots! Frequent updates! Most recent: 1.4 - Chaos! 1.3 - Valhalla! 1.2 - Varia! 1.1 - Exordium! 1.0 - Dante!",
