    "About the game": "Welcome to the Just Ignore Them Steam Store Page. Before considering purchasing Just Ignore Them, please try our FREE demo and read the rest of this section. Just Ignore Them is a point and click adventure horror that is mainly story driven. It contains an alterable story line which the player can control with critical choices. However, the main plot does not change (This is due to a possible sequel). The game is roughly a few hours long (For first time players), but this also depends on some of the choice you make during the game. It's your job to discover the mystery of the invading monsters. One night can feel like a lifetime of pain, suffering and horror to a child... The story starts of a Little boy at the age of 8 who is tormented by monsters that live in his house. He lives with his mother which works from home so she can look after him. You will be taking a glimpse into the future which can be altered by the choices you make, which will alter the game's ending. The story is to resemble some what of a movie script rather than a game.",
