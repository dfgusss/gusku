    "About the game": "A turn-based multiplayer strategy with puzzle elements that looks just like a tower defence game, but really, really isn't. Experience novel gameplay While it's hard to describe a concrete genre for Keep the Keep, one can imagine Chess mixed with Netstorm set in a quasi-medieval setting. Build a new Tower every turn to try and outmanoeuvre your opponent on a constantly evolving battlefield. Choose your own playstyle There are many different kinds of towers available for you to select, made to allow you full combat flexibility. Would you like to be extremely aggressive, attacking your opponent directly as soon as the opportunity presents itself? Would you prefer to build an impenetrable self-restoring defence? Would you set up some long-spanning plans to destroy the opponent's base with your loyal soldiers? Up to you to decide! Outsmart thy Opponent The towers you pick before the battle are kept in secret until built on the field. The turns are done simultaneously, so every turn brings an opportunity to force your opponent to guess what kind of tower are you going to build this time. This allows for plenty of unpleasant surprises and sudden ambushes. Is this work-under-construction a vicious attack or a bluff? Should I expect a risky move from my opponent or assume he's as afraid of me as I am of him? Psychological warfare plays a big role in Keep the Keep! Join us on Discord Keep the Keep is, at its core, a multiplayer game. Thus, we are building a community around it, to both help you find worthy opponents and good friends, as well as allow us to hear you out directly and incorporate your feedback into our updates. So, you are welcome to come in and experience the game as we intended it!",
