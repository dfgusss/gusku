    "About the game": "The gunfire roars, and the explosive flames rise in the wind-blown sky. Now, the flying battleships have begun gunfire. -What kind of game? A game where you control a fleet-scale airship and fight enemy flying battleships. I think it's more like a simulation or a strategy than an action. -Early access, how far can you play? The main part of the game, 'New Game', is not yet playable. Instead, you can play 'campaigns'. It is based on historical facts. -What is the world view like? This original world is based on the post-World War I and pre-World War II worlds. (plans) Steel ships fly in the sky, and countries have flying warships. (plans) -What kind of ship will appear?
