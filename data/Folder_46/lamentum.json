    "About the game": "Guide Victor Hartwell, a young aristocrat on a desperate journey to cure the deadly disease that afflicts his beloved wife, Alissa. Their last hope resides in the darkened halls of Grau Hill Mansion whose Earl has uncovered ancient secrets and forgotten sciences. He claims he can heal Alissa, but… at what price? Grau Hill mansion will open its doors and immerse you in a world of nightmares where you may be trapped forever. Lamentum is a pixel art survival-horror game set in New England in the mid-nineteenth century. To solve the dark secret at the heart of Grau Hill Mansion, you will have to immerse yourself in a nightmare world full of terrible creatures. Choose well in whom to trust, every decision you make may alter the course of the story. Will you survive? Lamentum is inspired by classic survival horror games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill along with cosmic horror masterpieces, especially the Cthulhu mythos. Lamentum is a dark and adult-themed game, in which the player can enjoy classic survival-horror gameplay. Lamentum is a classic survival horror, so our protagonist will attain different weapons and tools during his stay at Grau Hill Mansion. Victor will need a lamp to see in the dark, to use lock picks to open sealed doors and chests and use restoratives to recover his health. A myriad of other tools will be needed to forge a path through this twisting nightmare world. To defend against the dangers that haunt him, Victor will have many melee and ranged weapons at his disposal. Each weapon is different and has unique strengths and weaknesses. Choosing your weapon carefully is essential to survival. Firearms provide a huge advantage due to their range, but they consume ammunition, a resource that is scarce in Grau Hill Mansion. Many items may be hidden at first, use your ingenuity to find them. You can play Lamentum with keyboard and mouse (in the PC version) or use a gamepad. Your inventory is limited, and you will have to choose which objects to carry at each moment. In certain places you can use the item box to store objects for later use. Our inventory system allows you to create shortcuts to frequently used objects. This system allows players, for example, to quickly switch between a melee weapon, a ranged weapon and a potion, making combat more agile and effective. In addition, we can consult a diary that will record the thoughts and annotations of our protagonist. The world of Lamentum is full of nightmare creatures, each of them with different behaviors and attacks. Creatures are not the only danger in Grau Hill Mansion, there are traps that will reward your ingenuity or punish your mistakes with death, dangerous puzzles, and lethal environments. During your nightmarish journey you will meet other characters and strange beings. Think carefully about who you trust and who you don’t… every decision you make can have important consequences. Lamentum will have different endings depending on Victor’s decisions during the game. We want Lamentum to be a replayable experience and a challenge to obtain the best possible end.",
