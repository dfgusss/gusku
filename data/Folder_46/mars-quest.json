    "About the game": "Mars Quest is a dynamic 3D action game with a isometric view. The game takes place on Mars, where armored tanks and robots, and hundreds of mutants attack human colonies. In the game, you drive a special tank equipped with the latest technologies. You can choose from many types of tanks, weapons and additional equipment. In addition to the tank, you have the orbit support at your disposal. Using a special interface, you can place autonomous cannons on the surface, build forcefield covers, place minefields or drop bombs. This way you can gain control of the battlefield and an advantage over your opponent. The game also has a multiplayer mode in which you can play three types of matches in a Martian scenery. In the multiplayer game, you can use all available weapons and support from the orbital station, which makes the gameplay very dynamic, and each level can be tactically changed by players during the game. Additionally, the tanks are equipped with the possibility of turning on the FPP webcam. Thanks to this, the player can observe the FPP 3D view from the tank cabin in a separate window.",
