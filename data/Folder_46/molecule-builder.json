    "About the game": "This fun and engaging molecule builder will help you test out your chemistry knowledge. Feeling rusty? No problem - we help you out with tips to refresh your memory. There are three levels. First, you can practice your understanding of how atoms in a molecule bond. You will create the links between the atoms to form 3D molecules. You can even check if the molecule is stable before proceeding to the next step. Once you are done building molecules. You can pick one and apply the VSEPR model to predict the molecule’s geometry. Maybe you know where we are going with this. This is an important first step in being able to predict the molecule’s Polarity. The last of the exercises is to determine the polarity of the intermolecular bonds and hence, the overall polarity of the molecule. You’ll calculate the force of the vector between each atom as well as its direction. Look for the tips along the way. This is a fun way to get hands-on experience with all the theory in your textbook.",
