Build up your Towers of Defense to hold against the “Heroes” of Light and send out your swarm of deadly henchmen at the same time to conquer and enslave the whole empire of Eridia. A campaign with 20 unique levels in 3 challenging difficulties 6 unique Heroes with different spells and their own elite units Detailed death animations which were made with the high-tech GoreCap technology.
