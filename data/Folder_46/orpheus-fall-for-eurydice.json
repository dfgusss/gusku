    "About the game": "Brace for impact in Orpheus: Fall For Eurydice! Go (literally) through hell to rescue Eurydice! Patience is a virtue in a game where you will be better each time you fail! Clench your teeth and try to avoid everything that stands in front of you as you are falling to hell! But be careful, if you managed to die, you would be reassembled at the very begining... It's gonna be painful. You know it. Features: Fall through not less than 7 zones to get to your ultimate goal Unlock 9 unique skins A game that is easy to learn, but hard to master A beautiful soundtrack by Haakon Davidsen A polished pixel art atmosphere Fall, Die, Try again. Will you make it?",
