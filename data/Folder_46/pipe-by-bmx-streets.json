    "About the game": "PIPE is a physics based BMX experience built for the BMX community designed to simulate realistic BMX motion. Perform over 50 aerial stunts, grind any corner, send big airs in the PIPE! PIPE also includes some fun Easter Eggs for those willing to explore and think outside the box. Mash Games has been in the works of developing the all around EPIC console game BMX Streets. Mash Games chose to stay away from options such as crowd sourcing, and has been actively engaging followers through physics demo releases and the BMX Streets mobile game. Myself along with the small Mash Games team, have been working incredibly hard to define and develop the future of BMX (and other extreme sports) video game physics, from an independent level. The community has shown tremendous support through these projects, and it's now that I would like to introduce you to....BMX Streets: PIPE. So please, enjoy some delicious vert ramp boosting and lets SEND IT! *Game requires mouse input to launch. *Game play and Menus require a controller",
