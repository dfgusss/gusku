    "About the game": "Planet Invasion is an indie fast-paced game where you have to survive at all costs against the pesky humans that are trying to destroy your ship. You have only one objective, get to the center of the Solar System and win the bet. On the way there, Humans will make your life a living hell, dodge all of the super anti-alien missiles and show them who's boss. Since Humans are on the endangered intergalactic species list, you will not be able to use weapons to defend yourself. The year is...ummm….I forgot. Ok, let's do this again! In the distant future in a galaxy not far, but also not close from ours, a few alien friends got together for a night of space poker. On this eventful day, a bet arose: Who could make it to the center of the Solar System and survive. There was only one catch, you could not use any type of weapons since humans are considered an inferior species and are on the endangered species list. You took a chance, betting everything you had and took the stakes. Now it's up to you to make it there before all the others and win the bet. You have a wide selection of ships at your disposal to reach your goal. Some will be fast, other more durable. Use special powers to dodge the undodgeable and put the human race where they belong. (Show them who controls the Universe) Play in 10 different levels filled with all sorts of challenges throughout the Solar System, Can you make it all the way into the sun and return back alive!? Humans are part of the endangered species list, but they can still do some damage. You will face primitive but effective weapons that can still kick a punch. Multiple ships to choose from Survive challenging levels with increasing difficulty Each ship comes equipped with special powers that will help you on your quest Survive Human attacks Be the first to reach the center of the Solar System Soundtrack The soundtrack is completely original and was made by a friend of ours (José Batista), we tried to give it an alien feel. He worked very hard on the music and we hope you guys enjoy it! Disclaimer This is our first game on Steam and we hope you guys like it, we are still students and have a lot to learn.
