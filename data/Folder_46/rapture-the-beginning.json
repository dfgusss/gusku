    "About the game": "Story: You play as a famous archeologist and explorer who is venturing through an ancient temple in the middle of the desert. In his endeavor to find the great ancient treasure, he has to overcome the puzzles that are blocking his way. The road to the great treasure is protected by many deadly traps, and he will have to act quickly and use his skills wisely to overcome the obstacles and survive. The big temple walls hide one more deadly secret - the Ancient Guardians. The Game: Rapture - The Beginning is a platform adventure game based on solving logical puzzles and avoiding traps while carefully timing your movement and actions Key Features: - Player will explore a full 3D constructed world of an ancient desert temple following motives from Egyptian mythology - Player will face light logical puzzles, as the game progress, the difficulty of the puzzles will gradually increase - Player will face a different variety of traps, such as arrow projectiles, falling blocks, floor traps, enemies, massive contraptions that destroy everything in their way and much more - The carefully crafted world interacts with the player from all directions (traps, puzzles, enemies), leading to a unique experience Important - This game is a prototype: - The graphics are not 'top-notch', some rough edges can be spotted, not all models contain textures, some small light artifacts can be spotted. - There are few known issues in physics/movement behavior (using the box sometimes can break the game, jump-attach on wall edge sometimes is buggy, rare animation glitches, other small unpredicted physics behavior). - Storyline should be deeper and more meaningful - There is no music at all, only atmospheric sounds",
