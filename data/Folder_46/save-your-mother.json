Join her as she discovers the legend about the Elohim Cube, a mystical artifact that might be their only hope. Long lost to the sands of time, the Cube is said to possess incredible healing powers. Over the ages, many have attempted to retrieve the cube, but to no avail. All were foiled by the long and arduous path that leads to the cube, and in turn, salvation. Will you be able to unravel the mysteries of the Elohim Cube?
