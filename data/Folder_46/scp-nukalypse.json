    "About the game": "You play as Mikhail on his path to escape the SCP Foundation - a dangerous facility filled with anomalous entities that want you dead. Meet friends and foes along the way and fight your way to freedom. Along your way you might encounter anomalies that you cannot explain, it's best you don't think about it too much and just try to survive. All of them have a weakness and strengths. Make sure you listen to your superior officers when dealing with these anomalies. Nobody can know about any of this, any and all d-class will be terminated if they are to attempt escape. In the event of a breach, Special Forces Unit (designation Cobra-9) are to be sent to the site as soon as possible. All subjects apart from site faculty are to be terminated. That concludes this meeting. Please note down all important info. License: This game is derived from the SCP Wiki and SCP Foundation licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0.
