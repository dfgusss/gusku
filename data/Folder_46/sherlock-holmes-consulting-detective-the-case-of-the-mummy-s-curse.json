    "About the game": "The London Times started it all – calling the murders the work of an ancient Egyptian curse. I accused the tabloid of capitalizing on the superstitions of the populace. Yet, three men were dead, with the wrappings of a 4000-year old mummy binding their fates together. I find it hardly plausible and daresay believe the answers lie within the fabrics of a far more mortal realm. Once again, I have called upon the good doctor to accompany me.
