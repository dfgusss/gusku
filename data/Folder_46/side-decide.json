    "About the game": "The Game Side Decide is a relaxing puzzle game that harkens back to the wooden blocks of childhood. The objective is to roll a wooden cube to the end of the level. Each side of the cube features a different kind of shape and you can only roll onto a block with the corresponding shape and alignment. Rolling onto a circle allows you to rotate your cube, opening up branching pathways to help you achieve your goal. Teleporting, wildcard, and falling blocks all spice up the mix. Can you achieve gold on all 121 levels? Features Simple and pleasing aesthetics based on children’s wooden blocks Peaceful music that adapts to the player's progress 10 different block types each with its own unique mechanics Gold, Silver, and Bronze star ratings for each level give seasoned player's something to strive for 121 levels to unblock, 363 stars to collect. Can you get them all? Blocks!",
