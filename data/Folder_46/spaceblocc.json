    "About the game": "SpaceBlocc is a colorful minimalistic spaceship building game. A mysterious world you have to escape before it destroys you. BUILD YOUR SHIP Choose among 7 different parts to build your ship. By correctly managing your weight, thrust, and energy available you will be able to travel a different speeds. Slow and fast both have their advantages and disadvantages. Too slow and you will get destroyed by asteroid rains. Too fast and you won't have time to destroy obstacles before colliding with them. UNLOCK NEW PARTS You start with only the minimum. Unlock new parts as you progress through the game. These parts are required to advance to next levels, and obviously will make your ship stronger. RESCUE LOST ASTRONAUTS Rescue astronauts that were a bit too bold. Some are just out there ready to be picked up. Some decided it would be fun to have to be rescued in more dangerous areas.",
