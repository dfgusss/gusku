    "About the game": "In a single instant the lights faded and you ceased to remember anything. You wake up in a bizarre place, resembling an abandoned underground scientific complex. After wandering along the storeys you stumble against a weird slightly glowing thing-an artefact. You take it in your hands in order to understand its nature and suddenly comprehend with the whole power of your brain – HE knows about you now and is following you already. You are pressed for time and must be smart and fast to survive. This game is a survival horror in a closed maze, based on the collection of resources (energy) at randomly generated anomalous points. Prompts: The balance of a use of an energy of artefact for medical treatment, teleportation and the slowing –down of a monster are the key features of a game! The Crystals accelerate the speed of charging of artefact in anomaly You can exit the bunker only after you destroy a completely charged artefact in anomaly",
