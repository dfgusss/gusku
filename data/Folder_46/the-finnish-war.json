    "About the game": "The Finnish War is a real-time strategy game set during the eponymous Finnish War in the early 19th century. As the Napoleonic Wars rage throughout Europe, the faraway northern Finland is given its own theatre of war on a scale it has never before witnessed. But in the cold north, there are dangers not present in many other lands in Europe. Only the most hardened soldiers, be they from any kingdom or empire, can manage in the hazardous wildlands of Finland. In order to get to your enemies before they get you, you must brave the uncharted wilderness and face everything from frostbite to blinding blizzards and shortage of food. And then, you still must strategize to overcome your enemy, who is always keen on staying one step ahead of you... Lead Your Armies Personally You directly control a Leader character, around whom your army functions. Through him, you will direct your troops with a set of simple Commands. If your Leader character dies, the game's decided - keep him alive, but know when to bring him out to the field and when to retreat him safely back to your base. Remember that your Leader is needed to construct buildings, hunt food for your troops, and empower some of your units among other things. Sometimes, you cannot afford to be a coward - a Leader must stand near his troops - but be cautious, not reckless! The Unforgiving North The wilderness is your true foe - your enemies come second. In survival scenarios, which comprise most of the game, you will need to avoid hazards (cold attrition, hunger attrition, snowstorms, frozen lakes...) while simultaneously trying to gain advantageous positions over your opponent. While the Computer player is equally at the mercy of the wilderness and all its perils, they always follow a set of commands that help them try and gain an advantage over the player, while trying to minimize the risks of all hazards. Sometimes you might win your enemy in a battle, but afterwards find yourself with a half-dead Leader and a handful of remaining men, barely alive and complaining of cold and hunger, in the middle of the wilderness - and the nearest Camp a distance away... Historical Battles In addition to Custom Battles, you have two Campaigns - one for the Swedish and another for the Russians - which, among regular survival scenarios, allow you to experience many historical battles from the Finnish War in the form of battle scenarios. Unlike in survival scenarios, battle scenarios discard all survival elements and instead have large premade armies clash from the get-go. Battle scenarios take place on maps that have been tailored to accurately represent the battlefields from their real-life counterparts throughout Finland and Sweden. Custom Battles against the Computer or a Friend Custom Battles can be played on a variety of maps - both random-generated and premade - against a Computer opponent or in local splitscreen against another Player. Maps can have various different features like forests, rivers, frozen lakes, and often some type of gimmick. In Multiplayer, you can fully customize a map, adding or removing features to craft a random-generated map to your liking. Features: Two voice-acted Campaigns Historical battles in Campaigns alongside regular survival scenarios Custom Battles for singleplayer and two-players splitscreen Four playable Factions, two of which are unlockable Player Spoof AI: a toggleable option for Custom Battle Computer opponent where it mimics online players!
