    "About the game": "This is a minigame based rage game. Actually there are 10 different minigames with 3 difficulty levels each: - Space shooter: You control a space ship and need to survive and destroy the enemies by shooting them. Difficulty increases exponencially due to friendly collision avoidance and prediction of the player's movement. - Lander: Just land on the green platform avoiding hard impacts. Each propulsor is activated with one key (hard to control). - Canon: Shoot to all the objects within the given time. - Helicopter: Reach the end of the tube avoiding sensible hits. - Prevent the red button from going down: And don't get destroyed and destroy the enemy balls. - Memory: Memorize the path and repeat it. - Coloured balls: Match the other ball's color upon collision. - Jump through the hole: That's it. - Jump up: From one orb to another without touching the biohazard yellow material and reach de ceilling. - Shooter: Destroy all the moving objects but don't get too close. You can watch the trailer and see some of them. In the future, I may include some more minigames if the community supports me.",
