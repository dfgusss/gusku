    "About the game": "“It’s been few days since uncle’s body was found. Stocked up with a bare minimum of supplies, he took a tiny boat and set sails, destination unknown. Where he’d been headed, why did he have to die such a weird death... that remained a mystery.” Cyberfuture is now, the world has changed, but not the people. We were always guided by our human software. Codelines imprinted in the very cores of our hearts and minds by people, events and opinions. We cling onto them, we are made of them — the firmware of smart-everything is much more prone to damage than that of a human. Everything is written for us. What is good, what is bad. Words knight us and ignite us and set us into battles. Our world is made of words. And masks. The Soul Box is a kinetic visual novel about the mystery of a puzzle box. A story of a heritage hidden behind what’s written. A different look at the future, a worried glance at the past. What lies ahead: a linear story; two main protagonists and two worlds they live in; beautiful drag-n-drop puzzles; retrocyberpunk; animated BGs and amazing soundtrack.",
