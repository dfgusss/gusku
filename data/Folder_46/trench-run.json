    "About the game": "Trench Run is a 4-PLAYER local couch multiplayer game (with optional bots play and Steam Remote Play Together). It is easy to pick up and fun to play on gamepads. The price is low and in return for buying it you'll spend a hilarious couple of evenings blasting your friends. Enjoy! Make friends, then blow them to bits! Blow your enemies to bits in muddy trenches, then sip wine with them at the bar in the first multiplayer shooter with no death. Listen to a relaxing feel-good gypsy jazz soundtrack as you watch your screaming enemies ride rockets and explode crashing into walls. Howl with laughter. Repeat. Turn into a shrub. Have a dance off. Buy a pet crocodile. See you at the bar! Features: Local couch-based multiplayer (or singleplayer with bots) 5 classes with special skills to choose from (Assault, Sniper, Demolitions, Commando and Medic) Semi-random destructible maps Down on the ground? Grab a medikit and continue fighting! Play basketball and meet new friends between rounds Spend coins on drinks and cigarettes from the VIP bar Buy customized costumes and pet animals Online multiplayer available Designed to be easy to pick up and play, but deep enough to play seriously",
