    "Release date": "Dec 18, 2017",
    "About the game": "'A mixture of inspirations from Team Fortress 2, Doom, Quake, and even Overwatch, using only Water Splashes. Every part of the game redefines the Shooter genre.' Trianga's Project: Battle Splash 2.0 (or Battle Splash 2.0 for short) is an Epic Fast-Paced, Bullet-Dodging, Competitive, Team-Based Third Person Shooter that Creatively Redefines the Shooter Genre with No Killing, No Blood, No Violence, and full Water Splashes Physics. Fight against Dozen of Enemies, Dodging thousands of Bullet while facing off Giant Robot, all At-The-Same-Time! Your Class may be your Fate, your Actions and Skills may change your Destiny, yet your Tactic will shape your Path to Victory! Battle Splash tells a story about Trianga Polyga, who created a Virtual/Augmented Reality system that could simulate real-life experience/environment in an enclosed area, called 'Brainwave Oriented Simulation System (or B.O.S.s)'. She then wrote 'Battle Splash', a game inside B.O.S.s that features high speed Water Balloons and Water simulation in order to create the most intense Squirt Gun Battle ever. She then invited her friend (Temiko Kangara), her cousin (Pentaga Polyga) and her sister (Quadra Polyga) to test the game out. After an unexpected journey due to a bug during the test, she then further improved the game, and made the second version of it: 'Battle Splash 2.0'. The game is designed to be as Easy to Play as possible, while still keeps the best features of Classic Arena Shooter and Class-based Shooter. Battle Splash's gameplay heavily relies on Water Splash Mechanic, which changes the shape of the Splash Explosion depending on the surrounding area. In addition, the game is fully Physics-based, leading to Ballistic Bullets, Bouncing Balloons and lots of Physics features, thus feel free to perform some 'Redefined' old tricks from Arena Shooter such as Bullet Dodging, Rocket Jump or Balloons Hop. For even more diversity in gameplay, player can take control of the 4 playable Characters, which represent 4 different Classes in the game. Each character has their own Stats and Abilities that when combined with each Weapon they can further improve their performance or change their role in battle in real-time. Weapons' behavior can also change in real-time thus even more combinations can be carried out. However, without a proper Tactic, your Victory cannot be ensured. Carefully Organize your team, Analyze necessary information, and Carry out your plan perfectly are the keys to success. There are many Paths players can take in order to achieve the Ultimate Victory. Be Flexible, or be Determined, or be Open-minded about your Approaches. Key Features: Fast, Intense, and Challenging gameplay. The game is Epic even when no one dies, no one gets hurts, no violence. Water Splash mechanic: water splash will bounce off the surface upon contact, changing the shape of the Area of Effect. Run to Dry mechanic: The faster you move, the faster you recover/dry up. Bullet Dodging mechanic: No cover, just dodging! Dynamic Weapon Loadout System : Changing Weapon's behavior in real-time. 3 totally different game modes. Different Maps mean different Environment Mechanics. Play as you like: All Basic Weapons are available for all Characters. 4 Classes with different stats and distinct Special Abilities. Maximize your Class's performance, or Adapting your Class's abilities according to the Tactic, or both: Your Decision. Challenging AI players that can adapt to your performance and push your skills to the limit. Everyone can start their own Public/Private Server and enjoy a seamless match with Drop-in/Drop-out mechanic. Don't worry about Ping: some tests indicated that even 700ms Ping can play the game seamlessly. Support up to 4 teams per PC/Map/Server. Support up to 24 players/AIs (for minimum system requirement) and 32 players/AIs (for recommended system requirement) per PC/Server. Better rig/network connection can push the players/AIs limit beyond 32 . Partial Modding supports. Vast and colorful Environments that take places anywhere possible.",
