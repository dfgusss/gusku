    "About the game": "In this city-building game, you control a group of vikings, who have decided to try and settle down in a foreign group of islands, after they got lost at sea. They have only the cargo of their ship and their personal effects to start with. The most important resource is the viking people. Nothing is done without manual labor. Not only do they need food and homes, but in time, they will require things like warm clothes, pottery, jewels - and lots of mead! The fate of the people and their coming generations rests on your shoulders. Your people wants more than just a home and food. In time they will demand more non essential commodities like pottery, mead and jewelry. No single island has every necessary resource. In order for your people to reach the highest standards of living, you have to manage supplies from multiple islands. Life is not easy, even though there are no enemies. Your people will face the everlasting threats of sickness, starvation and the freezing temperatures. Campaign mode offers an increasingly challenging experience. Skirmish mode allows a great amount of customization options like starting conditions and world generating seeds.",
