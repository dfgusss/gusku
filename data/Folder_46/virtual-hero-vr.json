The ORV headset is directly connected to your brain’s neural network and it will immerse you in a universe of videogames that seems real, “The Game of Worlds”. In “Virtual Hero” the adventure starts at Rubius’ bedroom. There, the user will enjoy interacting with the TV series characters and elements. Until suddenly Rubius, in a desperate call, will ask the user for help. Magic, adventure and fun during an amazing trip where everyone will be able to measure his heroic qualities, after having designed their very own avatar identity.",
