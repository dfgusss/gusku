    "About the game": "This is a sad story, a tragic moment. In the summer of 1945, atomic weapons were used for the first time in human history. This VR game allows you to experience the feeling of being in Hiroshima, watching the atomic bomb slowly fall, the mushroom nuclear cloud rises, and everything around being dissolved by nuclear energy radiation. We wish that mankind will never experience the pain of war again. Peace forever. In the game, the player will walk in the city, and then witness the atomic bomb explosion. All the surrounding buildings disappear in an instant. A bustling city instantly becomes a wasteland with no one. You will experience the despair of the atomic bomb explosion. You can repeat the experience",
