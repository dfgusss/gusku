    "About the game": "What happens when a time machine goes crazy? Avoiding dangerous time paradoxes, your only hope is to repair the machine between the time rewinds. The antimatter instability causes a black wave of time-distortion, bringing you back in time: each time the cyber world will be populated by yourself and your past alter-egos. They will replicate all the actions you previously did, and being seen by them will cause a mortal time paradox. You will have to solve mini puzzles to retrieve the gears to repair the time machine, and to survive to your past-egos in a puzzle game with yourself and your own mind. FEATURES A GAME AGAINST YOURSELF ​You’ll have to remember your past actions, or plan your current actions, in order to reach the end. You are the player and the enemy at the same time. DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS IN A CYBER WORLD ​From a cyber blue forest to a yellow planetarium, you will travel between four areas with an unique aesthetic.
