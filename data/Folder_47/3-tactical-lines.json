    "About the game": "This app is a tactical card game. Build a deck with 40 cards. Place the units in the three lines of front line, middle line, and back line. Upgrade and enhance your unit. Equip your weapons and skills to increase your annihilation power. It can be strengthened with a formation card that activates when the number of people is met. You can use the Commander Card to interfere with your opponent. Defeating an enemy unit increases the draw penalty. The opponent draws the deck as much as the draw penalty. If your opponent loses the deck, you win.",
