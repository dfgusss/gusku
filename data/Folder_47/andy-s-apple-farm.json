In this game, you play a copy of a fictional beta test version of the game 'Andy's Apple Farm', a game that was supposed to be released in the mid-1980s. The game isn't actually a beta test, however, the game's version is designed to appear as one. The game starts to 'glitch' and reveal more of the story behind the game. This game has a lot of secrets to discover so it may require several playthroughs to have different experiences and fully understand the game's internal story.
