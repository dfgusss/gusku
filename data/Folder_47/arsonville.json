    "About the game": "You're armed with a small set of fire proliferating goodies, and only ONE chance to start the fire. Can you destroy the whole village? ArsonVille places you above a quaint little town, with limited time to place combustible objects around the map, and a single chance to set the fire. Try your best to burn all the tiles, take out the houses and burn down trees. Do all you can to contain your manic laughter as the village burns to the ground. With infinite possibilities and procedurally generated maps, there is no end of fun in ArsonVille. A calming, relaxing, yet slightly disturbing casual game.",
