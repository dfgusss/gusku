    "About the game": "Zip past polygon asteroids and dodge explosive space mines in this retro styled arcade-like VR experience. Speed through the galaxy with your hand and travel as far as you can, using your ship's experimental warp drive! Try not to smash into stellar rocks while gathering power ups like boosters and shields ! Watch out for incoming evil Follow Drones that love chasing fast moving space ships! Collect glowing golden gems to fuel your ship while dashing through the infinity of space. No buttons or triggers are required to play; simply use the position (and rotation) of the controllers! Have only a limited amount of time to play? The game offers an endless mode, but a time limit can be set! Configurable difficulty switches to add more challenge, such as changing the number of ships to start with. For more arcade like functions see the Arcade info file that comes with the game!",
