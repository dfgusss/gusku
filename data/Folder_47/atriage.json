Execute your strategy on a randomly generated playfield, opening new possible tactics every time you play. Take advantage of variations in your ship’s endurance parameters to withstand your rival’s onslaught, but watch out, if your battle strength reaches zero, it’s Game Over.

Dominate the playfield with four versatile, fully animated space warship classes , each with their own sets of unique attacks, movement patterns, detailed textures, and customizable colors. Master your fleet by taking on rival commanders in Offline Mode , featuring three distinct AI settings for players of different skill levels.
