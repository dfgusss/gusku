In 2019, various experiments were performed in Axizon Secret Laboratories and the leakage of a dangerous Virus Sample, called 'ZMB Virus' from the lab, caused panic among the people all around the globe.

During the pandemic, the UR Task Force came to know from the various sources that an Antidote of 'ZMB Virus' had already been prepared secretly in the same lab and the leakage of such a dangerous virus was intentional.
