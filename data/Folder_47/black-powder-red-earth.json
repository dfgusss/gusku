    "About the game": "The near present. Following the invasion of Iraq, Private Military Contractors(PMC) become the preferred instrument of foreign policy by Petro-Monarchies in the failed states of the Middle East. Staffed with US special operations combat veterans, PMC select, train and lead armies of local nationals in conventional and unconventional warfare operations. Combat actions conducted by the contractors are not considered acts of war. They are matters of foreign internal defense. Black Powder Red Earth® is a minute-to-minute turn-based tactics game set in a proxy war between the dictatorship of a failing petro-state and a brutal jihadist insurgency. Fighting in war-torn urban sprawls, players lead an enhanced capability advisory and enabler unit, conducting kinetic actions with full lethal surrogacy to accomplish their missions. Based on the Amazon best selling graphic novels of the same name, Black Powder Red Earth™ was developed with the support and advice of Special Operations combat veterans from the Commanders In-Extremis Force and by the designer of the Decentralized Battle Space Program. Black Powder Red Earth® has no tech trees, base building or R&amp;D mini-games. It focuses entirely on meaningful tactical decisions that influence the outcome of raids in urban environments. Step into the event horizon of absolute chaos — now.",
