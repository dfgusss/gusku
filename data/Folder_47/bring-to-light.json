    "About the game": "After your subway train crashes, you the lone survivor must explore the deep and winding tunnels to find your escape. But the further you explore, the more you realize there is more to this disaster...and creatures lurking in the shadows follow your every move. Navigate your way through treacherous puzzles that use light in different ways to solve them. Uncover the mystery behind the Avatar of Darkness and his vicious Shadowspawn and escape before the shadows close in around you! Bring to Light supports both VR and Non-VR. Experience an immersive Virtual Reality experience with Bring to Light on Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, perfect as a seated or standing experience. Or turn your lights out and lean into your monitor to play with mouse &amp; keyboard or gamepad! Bring to Light can use biometric (heart rate) data to change your experience in real time. Combined with our special AI, we are able to increase or decrease the intensity and scare factors in the game based on your heart rate. If you have a supported heart rate device, the game will know when you’re not scared enough- and scare you more! If you do not have a device, don’t worry. We will be influencing the events based on the heart rates of others who do and you will be sharing in the most frightening, scariest game with them!",
