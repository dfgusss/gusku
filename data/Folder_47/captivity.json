    "About the game": "You wake up to the smell of rotting flesh in what can only be described as someone's basement. Your memory is blank and your vision impaired, you have no idea where you are. The floors and walls are dirty, it appears there may be other people here as there are dirty sheets on the floor. There is shouting coming from above but there seems to be no other way out than up the stairs. Captivity is a new bloody horror experience featuring death, hopelessness and a tense atmosphere, it is up to you to escape captivity and deal with what ever stands in your way.",
