    "About the game": "A dark fantasy RPG with high replayability, and an emphasis on creativity instead of combat. Explore a vast open world where danger lurks around every corner, and a single misstep can make everything go wrong... But inversely, one well-placed stroke could make you a fortune... Claire's Quest: GOLD features exclusive content that is unique to this version of the game! Claire is a refugee fleeing the horrors of war, having lost everything and everyone she's ever known and loved. Far from being the stereotypical 'hero who wants to save the world', Claire is just another desperate civilian; she's no mighty warrior, nor powerful mage. She has no special gifts, save for a comely appearance, and in a world infested with criminals, monsters, and other sinister threats, that often bodes more ill than good. Cast out into an unforgiving new world, Claire is forced to rely purely on her wits and wiles in order to survive. Will Claire be able to forge a new life for herself, relatively unscathed from the horrors that stalk her? Or will she find herself meekly succumbing to the will of the rich and mighty, becoming little more than a toy for those with evil intent? You decide in this sprawling 18+ sandbox RPG! There are four pillars to gameplay which will shape and redefine each playthrough you experience: DEFIANCE - Muster your courage, and present a steely façade that causes your would-be oppressors to doubt themselves... INTRIGUE - Make use of stealth and espionage to cheat your way to the top, for a world of lies deserves no honesty. SEDUCTION - Sweet talk the opposition, and use sultry words and batted eyelashes to disarm even the most hateful of foes. DEPRAVITY - Give in and indulge in dark debauchery that promises great satisfaction... but risks consuming you completely.",
