    "About the game": "In Cop Academy, 4 to 8 players take on different challenges to earn points for their team, and pass the academy's final exam. Only one team will get to join the ranks of the prestigious Otterwa Police Department. And eat lots of donuts in the process. Each team takes turns in sending one of its champions to take on crazy fun challenges in VR. 5 quick trials of 20 seconds each will test your speed and dexterity. However, an officier never works alone. You will need the help of your teammates who have access to critical information on their PC display or TV. Cooperation is the key , so stay focused and communicate as much as you can. What do you do then?...when the opposing team is playing, and you have nothing to do on your couch/sofa/anything you are sitting on? How about trying to interfere with their communication? After all, real officers will face opponents who don't play nice, so why would you? You can also prepare your strategy for the next champion on your team to come well equipped. After all, good communication requires planning. Whatever your style of play, challenges will require you to find your inner action hero : eat flying donuts, release chocolate bars stuck in the vending machine and survive a riot (and more!), to prove what a fearless officer you can be. Do you think you have what it takes to be one of the best? Achievements await the bravest of officers, and medals reward you for reaching perfect success in a challenge. An actual medal. With a golden 'ok hand' emoji on it. If that doesn't tell you how impressed your supervisors are, we don't know what will. Cop Academy is perfect for hanging out with your friends for a great night (and is even better if you have some snacks to share). It has also proven to be a really good replacement for Rock-Paper-Scissors, for all you intense people out there.",
