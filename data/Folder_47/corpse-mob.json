Thanks for your support, we really appreciate it and it helps us getting better at making games! :) Battle huge zombie hordes and defeat abominations such as the Brute, the Kamikaze, the Spitter or the mighty Queen Team up with up to 4 buddies for some old school couch co-op and defeat the invasion together.
