    "About the game": "A local splitscreen multiplayer first person shooter throwback! Aiming to be all the best parts of your favorite classics of the genre, in one package! Nostalgia fueled graphics and gameplay collide in perfect timing with current technology to bring that irreplaceable feeling of a game night on the couch with friends, back to the forefront, for up to 4 of your foreheads! CPGN's unique features: - Gun mechanics (no 'fake bullets' from a magic ribcage-forehead instantly scanning hits) - 1:1 button-to-action gameplay (no pointless delays between you and the game) - Performance based handicap options (extra challenge for experts, more fun for noobs) - 100% hitbox / collision accuracy and no auto-aim (what you hit is what you shot at) - No loading screens (quality time for grandma to throw you through a window) - Randomly generated maps (infinite replay value and no map-memory advantage) - Clutch turning (run button can be held to make looking twice as snappy) - No crap-filler cutscenes to skip (you want a story? go watch a f###ing movie) - Skill-based 1-hit-kills mode (points awarded by weapons used to get the kills) - No lag or cheaters (all players on 1 machine but your girl still bangin' randos) - Custom splitscreen audio system (already being copied by AAA turd-factories) - 597 types of Motion Blur and ugly glowy bulls### to turn off because why not",
