    "About the game": "NEW RELEASE: / 'Dark Cards' is a card game where you battle opponents by building a deck. In this game you are a debt collector, and face a strange race in the universe and start a crazy adventure. You need to build a deck based on the existing cards to defeat your opponents to complete debt collection. The cards of both sides in the match are randomly mixed and placed in different positions, and the number of cards that can be opened per turn is limited. You can choose to open your own card steadily, or venture to open your opponent's card to interfere. We have prepared three types of cards for you: ● Flip a Tool Card attack the opponent. ● Flip a Treasure Card to strengthen your Tools. ● Or ... Flip a Trap Card? In addition, there are random events to obstructs both parties. Of course, this may also accidentally save your life. There are more than two-hundred cards for you to build from. Be sure to combine powerful cards to defeat your adversaries. We have prepared two game modes: story mode and challenge mode: ● In story mode, you can play against a variety of characters as the story advances, and complete a well-prepared fancy adventure. It contains multiple endings for you to experience. ● In the challenge mode, you will face the challenge of one battle after another. By constantly changing your deck, you will defeat all opponents and eventually defeat yourself. Thank you for your attention and support!",
