Rootkits must collaborate with your operating system in someway to do something useful. They come with a driver file that you might see. Also rootkits are old threats. Microsoft is using driver signing procedures for a long time and the operating system does not load them if they are not signed. Modern operating systems also use hardware abstraction layers. New systems are leaving legacy BIOS mode and using UEFI. It is very hard to find a working rookit today. Where are the foreign IP addresses and ports on the Network monitor page? Right click on the table and click the 'Show IP Addresses' button. But this is out of the scope of this software. It finds the most static information possible and compares them. Dozens of foreign IP addresses and temporary foreign ports are used just in a day. But there are not so many processes that use your internet. If you find a newly installed software that uses your network, you may discover a spyware, adware, etc. Detective Bit Bytes' Toolbox - The Time Machine brings you enough information to find a network using process. I got an error. What can I do? Please check if there is a file named 'detective_bit_bytes_service_log.txt' or 'detective_bit_bytes_log.txt' in the installation folder. If you find one of them, send it to the support address or the community room. Do the log files keep the content of files? No. they just keep metadata for comparison. Their disk size usage is also quite low because of this reason. Logging a whole partition that has 700.000 files takes only 10 megabytes. Can I move my log files? Yes. You can find the 'LogData' folder in the installation folder. But the log files' hashes must be the same to compare. Hash is generated from monitored and excluded paths. If you monitored different paths, you can't compare them. You can use these file creatively. You can get a log from a clean Windows installed computer and compare with the other PCs, etc. Can I use Steam cloud? No. Steam cloud is disabled for this product. Everything is kept locally (on your system). You can upload your data to your favorite storage by copying the log folder, manually. You can also add extra protection by using encrypted zip, etc. What is the status of my license? It is a lifetime license. You can keep it forever in your Steam account. Only one person (the Steam account owner) is allowed to use the software. How can I search the text results? The tool gives you organized result data in a treeview. Searching a treeview is a time-consuming task and it is not a suitable component for this aim. You can export data and use your favorite text editor for this task. There might be so many user requirements about searching functionality. Some users prefer regex, the other ones want simpler search functions. This tool is designed for everyone. Simplicity is the first aim of this product. How can I use this product for malware analysis? It requires Steam. The product is integrated to Steam for licensing. You can use a virtual machine and you can use Steam in offline mode (The license supports only single Steam user) If you use this product for commercial purposes, you can create an account for the software and use two step verification.
