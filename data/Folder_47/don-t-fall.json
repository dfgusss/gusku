    "About the game": "Don't Fall is a third-person action multiplayer game where 8 players are put on a shrinking island. As more tiles fall and shatter, the island becomes more cramped, and the risk of falling becomes ever higher. Pick up powerful weapons, and knock the enemies into the abyss. Become the last man standing. Items Strategically use special items to push the other players over the edge. Either use bow and arrow to shoot the enemies who stand close to the edge, or use the Mask of Bull to ram into the unprotected enemies. Gameplay Each player has a fatigue point. The higher your fatigue point is, the further your enemies will push you. The risk point will increase each time you are hit. Use healing energy to reduce fatigue points, but be mindful about nearby enemies because you will be defenseless while you are healing. Weapons The game has five unique melee weapons that have drastically different play styles. Seek out your favorite melee weapon, engage your enemy in soul-like melee combat. Roll to dodge critical hits. Manage your stamina so you don't ever become incapacitated. The Arena Every a few seconds, a tile will fall. The remaining space becomes ever smaller. Your enemies will not be kind and will try anything they can to push you off. Defeat them before they make you fall!",
