    "About the game": "You're a drawing, but why stay on your paper? Explore a unique and wonderful world of doodles in this short, charming art-venture! As a doodle, you need constant contact with the page to survive! You can jump from paper scrap to paper scrap, but don't get caught in the void between them for long! Heaps of unique doodles, many of which animate, say things to you, make noises or otherwise come to life! Collect stickers to progress through the game, and avoid hazards drawn with red ink! A brief love letter to creativity with a 15/20 minute completion time! 100% the work of a one-man developer including graphics, music, design, sound and coding! Contains repeated references to dinosaurs for some reason! Meet an indignant loaf of bread? It's DOODLE TIME! DISCLAIMER: Doodle Jamboree may not feature an actual jamboree!",
