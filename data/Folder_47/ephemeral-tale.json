Ephemeral Tale is a dungeon crawler/looter hybrid for the modern age, featuring hand-crafted dungeons, classic JRPG-style combat, and a loot-driven progression system. Traverse through hand-crafted environments in search of those who hold the power to rewrite fate. As you tackle the game's diverse dungeons, you'll discover clues that will reveal the secrets of this forgotten land. Collect powerful, randomized gear and build your own style of play! With over 80 pieces of unique loot, there's always something new to try. Engage in challenging combat that can be approached in many different ways. Find and personalize the build that works for you while you fight exciting enemies and challenging bosses alike! Fight an undead T-Rex. Befriend a dog. Pet a grackle...? Ephemeral Tale includes a range of accessibility options, from control schemes (including keyboard, controller, and touch input) as well as colorblind settings and difficulty options, empowering you to play however you decide you want (or need) to.",
