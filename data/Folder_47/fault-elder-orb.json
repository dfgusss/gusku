    "About the game": "WELCOME TO FAULT At Strange Matter Studios, we are invested in rebuilding and improving upon the 3D action MOBA genre. CHOOSE YOUR HERO Select your play style with many variations of hero’s; from a massive hammer-wielding soul collector to a space mage with control over interdimensional portals. Play games to unlock more heroes to add to your collection and master the battlefield of Fault! GROW STRONG WITH FAVOR A unique gameplay element that separates Fault from other MOBAs is the introduction of a feats system, which allows a player to gain strength by achieving milestones during a match. ADAPT AND EVOLVE Fault has many unique items to choose from that can sway the flow of battle. Collect gold from minion and hero kills and build your hero to handle any situation. MAP AND OBJECTIVES Fault has an original map suited to tactical play with its verticality and well planned out jungle paths. The jungle is full of creatures that when slain will increase you and your team’s strength. Paragon assets and characters in Fault are the property of Epic Games, Inc. and used under a license.",
