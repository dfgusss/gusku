    "About the game": "Flight of the Athena is a Shmup + Roguelite twin-stick shooter; earn new craft, weapons and upgrades as you take on the enemy fleet to destroy their central command, and win this war. **Please note: Flight of the Athena is a twin-stick shooter – a dual analogue controller (e.g Xbox, Playstation) is required for each player** Dynamic campaign and level generation - Levels are generated and scaled based on a number of factors (campaign progress, difficulty, etc). Each experience will be unique, with the focus on air combat awareness rather than learning levels. Choose the routes on the campaign map that will serve you best, using the information to hand. Local co-op (2 to 4 player) - Form a wing and take on the campaign with additional pilots. Watch each others backs, and take care in the air! Varied ship classes and configurations - A number of craft are available, from the small and nimble Skydoos through to the heavier, lumbering corvettes. Each of these can be configured with a wide range of weaponry available; choose your loadout appropriately for the mission in hand. Multiple difficulty settings - A selection of difficulties are available, to suit the casual adventurer through to the hardcore shmupper.",
