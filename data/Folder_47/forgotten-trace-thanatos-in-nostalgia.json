    "About the game": "It all began with a beautiful lullaby... Forgotten Trace: Thanatos in Nostalgia is an enchanting all-ages dramatic mystery visual novel by developer Almaz. Story 'This is a love story adrift in time eternal, woven from the grief of a girl.' Nanami Kazuya finds himself in a place that he can't identify as either a dream or reality. Under the northern stars, the young man who has lost everything when his dream crashed, is now all alone in a forest dark and snow-covered.

'I wanted to see you, Kazuya...' She whispers and kisses him. Right beside the couple blooms a single violet flower unaffected by the snow, as though watching them... In Kazuya's town, there has lately been a string of mysterious suicides committed by people with various medical issues. Someone with a leg problem jumped off the roof of a building; someone with a hand problem wrote a suicide note in their own hand before their death. Kazuya recalls the snowy forest and how he didn't feel any pain in his knee there. 'Who was that beautiful woman? And what's the meaning of everything that happened there?' There is one thing he does not yet know about himself: That he himself is one of the seven symbols that lurk in the back of his memories from the distant past. And it all began with that beautiful lullaby...",
