    "About the game": "A game I made For a certain kind of person To hurt them. Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy is a punishing climbing game, a homage to Jazzuo's 2002 B-Game classic 'Sexy Hiking'. You move the hammer with the mouse, and that's all there is. With practice, you'll be able to jump, swing, climb and fly. Great mysteries and a wonderful reward await the master hikers who reach the top of the mountain. To quote Jazzuo himself: 'The hiking action is very similar to way you would do it in real life, remember that and you will do well'. Climb up an enormous mountain with nothing but a hammer and a pot. Listen as I make philosophical observations about the problem at hand. Between 2 and ∞ hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 5 hours, but the mean was closer to ∞. Lose all your progress, over and over. Feel new types of frustration you didn't know you were capable of. Magical reward awaits hikers who reach the top. Epilepsy warning: contains some surprising elements.",
