    "About the game": "goto is a minimalistic maze game which leads you to finish each level by moving in 4 directions, avoiding obstacles and clearing the path. Every level has its own record amount of moves. For example, you have to complete level 0 by moving only 7 times. If you fail, you get 2 or 1 cube out of 3 (stars rating analogue). But if you beat the record, you'll get a special achievement for each level. Levels' complexity increases every time you pass a level. Can you beat the highest one? There is no plot included. Player can't die by touching obstacles. Main features : — 50 mind testing levels : can you beat all the levels achieving 3 cubes? Let's figure that out! — 100 Steam achievements : you have to achieve 'em all you know. — Retro atmosphere : pixel-art graphics and chiptune soundtrack are here for you! — Xbox controller support : you obviously should try it if you have one! Controls : Arrow keys / WASD (left stick or Dpad) — Movement. Enter (A button) — Select. Esc (Back) — Return to main menu. R (Start) — Restart level. Music by Xenon Odyssey",
