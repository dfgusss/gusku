Our end goal is to provide a nice looking, festive environment for you to build a snowman, or anything else you can think of using our array of various props. Decorate Choose from over 50 different props to decorate your snowman, or environment. Mix and match different eyes, mouths, arms, hats, accesories and more—get creative! We'll be adding even more accessories in future updates. Tools Use five different tools to help you create your perfect snowman! For more detail on what the tools do, please see the section - 'What is the current state of the Early Access version?' Save You definitely want to save your hard work! For this, we have the “Snow-globe Generator!” This will take your decorated snowman and put it in a snow-globe. It will also save any props you have spawned and placed in the environment. The snow-globe is saved to your shelf inside Krampus’ cabin, where you will be able to revisit them if you so choose! Each profile has 10 slots, for a total of 30 saved snowmen!
