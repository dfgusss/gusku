How to Make a Killing Features: Open world exploration and action RPG combat Consequence-driven quests and dialogue choices 13 side quests and 20 unique enemies 28 items with a variety of uses and story implications Inventive puzzles that blend player abilities with in-game objects Throwing knives, invisibility cloaks, lightning, and more Murder And rabbits In Hamelin, every choice is permanent, which means you can’t just hack and slash your way through quests like you would in a purely linear ARPG. Your choices have consequences, shaping the world and impacting events yet to come. Kill someone? They're dead. Steal something? It's stolen. Say something? You said it. Talk to a rabbit? Live with things that you can’t unhear. Rabbits fill the world of How to Make a Killing, and they are just as willing to kill you as they are to share what’s on their mind. Will you trust the rabbits? Will you endure hearing the sordid details of their private lives? Will you take their advice in the tutorial? Will your sword be enough to fend them off when they attack?",
