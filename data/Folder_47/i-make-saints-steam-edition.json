Since this game was built with Unity 2017, there is a chance launching the game will trigger your antivirus. If this is the case, please refer to the official Steam Support page about antivirus software interference . The game I Make Saints is a short first-person psychological horror walking simulator which can be completed in 30 minutes. Wander the personal hell of a deranged individual and discover the true nature of their terrible crimes through notes, objects and saintly icons left over different atmospheric and at times surreal environments. I Make Saints is a raw, demanding work attempting to make sense of the most despicable acts. Some souls are so damaged that they end up damaging others. Some minds seeking redemption are nonetheless irredeemable. Some dark obsessions take hold and won't let go. Welcome to guilt. Features Four varied environments to explore : surreal, improbable places that feel like a dark dreamscape Low risk gameplay : no enemies putting the player in danger, just a tense and heavy atmosphere Disturbing narrative : true-crime style events are implied, but never shown What's new in Steam Edition Similar to a director's cut, this version of I Make Saints contains material that was originally cut from the initial release, such as : An entirely new environment : walk the halls of the orphanage and shed some light on the past of the protagonist Unused dark ambient musical track has been added back to the game Minor changes to existing environments to ensure a better flow throughout",
