    "About the game": "Set in a 90's retro future, Inertial Drift offers a driving experience genuinely unlike anything you've played before – boasting twin stick drifting mechanics that need to be felt to be believed. Welcome to Inertial Drift: Sunset Prologue - a place to put your racing credentials to the test before Inertial Drift arrives later this summer. Hone your skills by the lakeside, then head to the coast for a sunset showdown and pitch your best time against the most skilled drivers on the planet. Conquered the demanding twists and turns of the Sunset Circuit? Think again. Step into HPE’s high performance car - The Dragon - and discover what it REALLY means to master the art of drifting. Unique Twin Stick Controls for Precision Drifting The left stick handles steering, the right hand stick gives you total control over your drift. Intuitive for new players and uniquely challenging for pros. Two Challenging Tracks Lakeside Loop - The long, sweeping bends of the lakeside are the perfect place to learn your craft as you race around the water’s edge. Sunset Sea Circuit - A gorgeous neon sunset provides the backdrop for this technically demanding track. Two Fiercely Individual Cars Coda Gecko - Coda’s most popular model, the Gecko strokes a balance between speed and control. It’s great all-round performance and predictable handling make it perfect for racers looking to hone their skills. HPE Dragon - Intimidating to drive and to race, what HPE’s high-performance Dragon lacks in subtlety and manoeuvrability, it more than makes up for it in raw power and top speed. The Best Is Still To Come Inertial Drift is coming this summer to tear up the racing rulebook. Wishlist Inertial Drift now on Steam to be the first to receive updates on the full, 16 car and 20 track racing game.",
