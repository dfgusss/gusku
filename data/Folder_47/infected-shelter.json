    "About the game": "What Is Infected Shelter? Infected Shelter is an ultra-violent rogue-lite post-apocalyptic brawler. Singleplayer and co-op for up to four players. Every run is different because of the randomly generated content. Players can loot more than 170 different blueprints of permanent improvements and this is the key to Infected Shelter's replayability. Instead of just collecting loot to make yourself more powerful during a single run, you unlock new weapons, clothes, skills, relics and RPG-like character improvements that change how you play the game in the following runs. Gameplay &amp; Story You play as a member of a surviving group in a post-apocalyptic world. On one fateful morning, you awake to find the shelter is raided and your people are kidnapped for reasons unknown. Leaving your shelter you emerge into the harsh infected land and start looking for the kidnappers and the truth behind the events. Your path leads you through randomly generated post-apocalyptic areas controlled by different enemy factions with brutal leaders and shelters occupied by infected creatures. You have to use your skills in a fast-paced, violent, and complex 2D brawler-like combat where lots of firearms and melee weapons are waiting for you to beat and execute your enemies. You will unlock new weapons, clothes, skills, relics and RPG-like character improvements during your journey.
