    "About the game": "Master the skill of racing karts accelerating to 60mph in just 3.2 seconds with no suspension whilst fighting 20 other drivers. Learn what it takes to corner at over 2.5G while balancing on only three wheels as your engine screams at 21,000 RPM. Hear your tyres squeal as they slide and deform, trying to grip the track. Experience the most advanced vehicle physics ever produced for a racing game with KartKraft. SHOWCASE YOUR STYLE Look the part and stand out from the competition. Kit up in the latest gear from Alpinestars, Arai, Freem, Momo, OMP and Sparco with more being added during Early Access content updates. Dress the way you want by choosing the suits, gloves, boots and helmets to show off your unique style. FULL CUSTOMIZATION Build your kart from the ground up with over 60 components and 1000+ parts that all affect handling. Swap out axles, sprockets, carburetors, rims, hubs, torsion bars and many more. If you can see it, you can change it. LASER SCANNED CIRCUITS Feel your kart bend, twist and bounce on every bump, crack and kerb in the track as you drive on officially licensed circuits from around the world. Scanned with the same technology used in laser guided missile systems, every surface is accurate to the millimeter. The only thing closer is real life. LEADERBOARDS Learn from the best as you climb your way to the top of the leaderboards in the ultimate hotlapping competition. See where you rank against your friends, your country and across the globe. With every lap recorded and uploaded to our servers in high-fidelity, see exactly where your competitor brakes, turns and accelerates to gain the edge and send them home.
