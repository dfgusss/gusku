    "About the game": "KnockDown KnockDown is fun for young and old. In the 2D version of the classic tin can alley game it's about hitting cans with a ball and clearing them. You have to remove different obstacles or solve small puzzles in order to get to the cans. Good timing and skill are always helpful. Sometimes, however, it only helps to knock the cans down with enough force. In the 8 scenarios with a total of 160 levels the little tennis ball 'Benny' has to master various environmental influences such as weightlessness or currents on the seabed, to clear away all the cans. Insidious dangers can lurk here and there. The difficulty varies from scenario to scenario and caters to both beginners and savvy Gamers. There are also 22 motivational achievements. Those who have already mastered KnockDown can also prove their skills in 16 leaderboards. KnockDown is a 'real' indie game. No 30-person development team, no million-dollar budget, no publisher, nothing. Only one developer and approx. € 3000 for software licenses and store fees. But now have fun! Your developer Mino ps.: ... 'better KnockDown than Lockdown !!!' 😉",
