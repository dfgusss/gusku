A world where your main goal is to grow, build your home, make friends, fight against the biggest predators, fight against other players, survive and become a legendary warrior! Story: Long ago, an evil magician named Daeron created a really powerful weapon. His goal was to rule the world! However, after an unexpected fight, he was defeated by another magician named Sathenu. Sathenu found Daeron's weapon and broke it into relics and scattered them around Time. Then he created an ancient organization to protect these relics, and two Artifacts for anyone to travel back in time, if the world is in crisis again. The Guardians of Time were the protectors of these relics. Then, thousands of years later into the future, Nrutas, an orphan, realizes his power. So he finds and uses one of these artifacts to travel back to the first relic location, the Medieval Era, within the Kingdom of Atheos! However, the second Artifact, is left to you... Actual game features: Animal taming Is a really unique feature which allows you to tame an animal with a spell and after a successful taming, you will be able to give orders to the animal, such as: attack, follow, stay or release. Polymorph scroll Is aswell an unique feature on Lonath Online which allows the player to turn into a monster for a few minutes. This will give you the abilities and strength of the monster that you turn into. Polymorph scrolls can be found from monster drops and also on shops. Housing Is one of the main features on Lonath Online. This feature allows you to own your own house in the game. You are able to build a house per each map. The house will be your alternative resurrection place after you die. It can also be your friend's alternative resurrection house. You are able to add up to 5 friends to your house. To place a house, you need a house deed. House deeds can be found on scribe shops in villages. There are 3 different type of houses at the moment: 1) Empty Wooden House An empty wooden house. Only as an alternative resurrection point for you and your house friends. 2) Expert's House Includes a scribe vendor inner house. You can sell items and buy potions by using the vendor. 3) Master's House Includes a scribe vendor and replenish stones inner house to regenerate your health and mana. There are also a few rules for house placements: - You cannot place your house too close to the village. - You cannot place your house if the house is touching an obstacle or a monster spawn (detected by the server). Trade system Allows you trade 2 items and gold coins per trade session. You can trade with other players using the Trade button on the bottom right menu and then pointing the mouse to the desired player you wish to trade with. After you get the trade menu, drag an item from your inventory and put on the trading slots. The left side of trade screen is yours and the right one is the other player's one. Treasure maps Allows you to find treasures containing items from normal, rare, unique or legendary ones. You can find treasure maps by killing monsters and they may drop a treasure map. After you are in the right village indicated on the treasure map, track for the position. You can use the minimap on the right top corner of the screen to see your position by coordinates. When you are in the right location, just right click on the treasure map and you will get the treasure. Remember that there is a small chance that you may not find any treasure aswell! PvP Is also a main feature on Lonath Online. This allows you to fight with other players from different classes. This is where you are going to show your real skills! Players that want to fight with each other must be outside the safe zones. Killing other players gains you XP which increases your levels, same as killing monsters. Magic spells Allows you to use magic spells against other players and monsters. Using spells requires Mana. You can fill your Mana by drinking Mana Potions or staying next to Mana Replenish Stones. You can assign a spell to your Spellbar from the Spellbook. You should left click on a spell on the Spellbook and drag it to the Spellbar, then left click again to put it on the desired number on the Spellbar. To drag a spell from the spellbar, you need to hold left mouse button on the spell. To cast spells you should left click on them on the spellbar. You can aswell use hotkeys (numbers 0-9) to cast spells, and some spells can only cast by using hotkeys. Custom hero creation Allows you to create a custom hero choosing from 3 different classes: Warrior - you can take this class if you want your highest ability to be Strength. Mage - you can take this class if you want your highest ability to be Magic. Defender - you can take this class if you want your highest ability to be Defense. Horse Riding Is a really cool feature which allows you to ride horses and other available rideables. Riding a horse does not need any special ability. You can get a horse by buying it on Riding shops in villages. You can choose from 7 different horses to buy (including a Unicorn) or a velociraptor. Shops Allow you to buy items for your character. To shop you have to use Vendors. Vendors can be found on villages. Each Vendor sells different items such as: weapons, shields, dresses, armors, robes, rideables, jewels and other items. Targeting When you point your cursor on a player or a monster, they will be your active target. A box will appear on the top of the screen when you have an active target including their name and health. When you have an active target, your melee attacks and spells will address to the active target, except these spells: Teleport, Wall of Fire, Wall of Stone, Starfall Storm, Hell Storm. These spells must be targeted by pointing your cursor to your target. Melee attack This is a really unique feature we implemented. The feature itself is not really unique, because most of the MMORPGs have this feature, right? But, we made a little tweak, which makes the game more realistic, yet harder. You can use Melee attack by left clicking on your mouse, but if you are too far away from the target, you will miss! This being said, to use Melee attack you must be really close to your target so you can hit them. There is also a cooldown system, after every hit you make, a bar in the bottom of the screen will show with a countdown. After you make a Melee attack against your target, you will have to wait a few seconds, depending on the weapon, to make your next Melee attack.",
