    "About the game": "In Loot Slider, your goal is to move treasure chests to spaces with keys. To do this, you place and aim cannons on grid-like levels, making sure that they fire and push chests in correct order. Over the course of the game you will visit levels from the Tropics, Jungle, Tundra and Volcanic. Each island has its own interesting puzzle mechanics, as well as new types of cannons. The better solution you find on a level, the more stars you get. The ultimate goal of the game is to get all 168 stars. Key Features Relaxing gameplay You can take as much time as you need to solve a level, and you can try as many times as you want. You can always return to a level later on if you want to get more stars. Tricky puzzles Loot Slider challenges you to figure out where to place cannons, in what direction to aim them and in what order they should fire. This creates a ton of variety, and lots of tricky levels. Clever mechanics As you get further in the game, new cannons are introduced - the Repeater and Heavy Cannon. Each new world comes with its own set of unique mechanics and obstacles, such as totems, ice and lava cracks. Catchy soundtrack While trying to figure out how to get those stars, you'll have some melodic and catchy songs to listen to in the background. Star collection In each level you can earn up to 3 stars. Every star require you to accomplish an objective, such as opening a certain amount of chests, or not using more than a specific number of cannons. If your aim is to get all 168 stars, you're in for a challenging but rewarding journey",
