    "About the game": "Close your eyes, put your VR headset on, and you’ll become a shipwrecked man, on a tropical island in the middle of Pacific Ocean. First of all, you have to survive. That’s because your hunger and thirst will make you suffer, like in real life. So you have to understand how to satisfy your primal needs, interacting with animals or plants that you will find on the island. Of course you will need to craft some tools, using rocks, wood, plants, and start a fire to cook or to have light during the night. But, if surviving is your first objective, the second one is to escape the island. To achieve to runaway, you’ll have to build a raft and face the Ocean’s waves. Can you handle it?",
