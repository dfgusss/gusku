    "About the game": "Build Your Arsenal Craft more and more powerful blades. Forge metals from raw ore. Smelt ingots and shape them into sword blades. Lathe wooden handles and piece together progressively powerful creations. Custom Physics Code Custom physics code allows us to use more targeted physics contraints to produce better results for very specific use cases. These systems can interact with and provide a layer ontop of stock PhysX interactions in the Unreal Engine. Physics development footage: Exercise Burn calories while busting targets and testing your blades in this exhilarating Role Playing adventure. VR Interactivity Reusable systems simplfy generic usecases for interaction in VR spaces. The systems can interact and influence each other in realtime to allow for unique play experiences. Mining Process ore by passing it through an elaborate washplant. Feed, grind, trommel and shake away all the useless rock to reveal precious ore. Then upgrade your machine, piece by piece, to find more quantity and quality of ore and gems. Time Chamber Once you have created your finest armaments, put them to test in this special chamber. Test the strength of your blades and armor, all the while collecting money, experience and loot. Every venture into the chamber will get you a little closer to the ultimate test.",
