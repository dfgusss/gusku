    "About the game": "Milo is a horror game where the player will find himself trapped in dungeons from which he will have to escape. And in crossing the various caves and catacombs, you will have to be careful not to run into one of the monsters that populate them, including skeletons, zombies and werewolves. In the unfortunate hypothesis that one of them notices his presence, the only possibility to save himself will be ... run. Set in a medieval fantasy world, the protagonist ... Milo embarks on a voyage by ship to bring a wedding gift to his friend, Baron Valek. Recently married to his beloved's sister. But when he reaches the port of the village of Valmore, which is near the castle, he is attacked and dragged into an underground prison. From here begins his adventure ... or perhaps it should be said ... his misadventure.",
