    "About the game": "In this game for kids, we learn traffic rules through an interesting adventure full of weird characters. The game was developed by the Gamechuck studio for the RODA - Parents in Action Association. Roda is a non-profit association advocating for dignity in pregnancy, parenthood, and childhood in Croatia. Roda has been renowned for its perennial Safety in Booster Seat program, which goal is to raise awareness of parents and the public about the importance of correct use of booster seats. You learn about everything traffic-related; from traffic behavior, crossing a zebra, using a bicycle properly, wearing seat belts, and many other important things, all through the story of a small park full of cute monsters. The main character has an inventory in which he carries various things; from a bicycle pump to a piece of park fence, and everything he finds will help him in his task to restore the park fence blown away by Mr. Smog who lives in Smogograd. The game ends when the park is restored and when the player discovers the mystery hidden in the smog city, but for that, you will need to blow all the smog using all the traffic knowledge at your disposal! The second part of the game is called Parkoljupci. They want a bigger park. It is intended for slightly older children, those aged 10 to 14. The city is congested with traffic, and Plavko wants to renovate the park, which is too small for the needs of the city and is not landscaped. In order to succeed in that, he needs to motivate his overworked fellow citizens to join him in the protest. The task is not so difficult because he has understanding and shows empathy for them, thus gaining their attention and manages to gather a critical mass to participate in the protest for a larger park. The game ended when everyone Plavko helped gathered in the park to protest, looking for a bigger and more beautiful park. In front of the united citizens, the mayor has no choice, and the city gets new lungs - a large and beautifully landscaped park that everyone enjoys. The game is made for children in the lower grades of primary school, but it is regularly enjoyed by the upper grades of primary school and even the elderly. In addition to that, the game is made with the open-source Godot Engine.",
