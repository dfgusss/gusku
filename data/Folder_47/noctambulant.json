Hello, I’m Justus Yew, the creator of Noctambulant. Noctambulant is a game idea I had in 2019, but it never materialized until now because I wasn't able to create it the way I imagined it to be. Now I'm really excited to be able to finally have it on Steam for all to play! Noctambulant will be available in English, Chinese and Japanese. Every art asset in the game is hand-drawn from scratch by me and my sister. (Environment, Objects, UI, Characters, Illustrations…etc). We’ve put together the entire game, aiming to make it as enjoyable an experience as possible. The story, atmosphere, puzzles, build ups and more. There are no jump scares while playing Noctambulant! With the intention for a different kind of horror, I want the players to have a mind free of jump scares, and fully immerse into the environment.",
