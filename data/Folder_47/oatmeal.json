    "About the game": "PLEASE READ SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BEFORE BUYING. Oatmeal. This game is about oatmeal. In this game, you have a spoon, and 1 minute to eat as much oatmeal as you can. It's not as easy as you think. In the base game, there are 8 areas each with 3 levels, for a total of 24 levels. But this is not where the journey ends. There is a custom level editor where you can make, save, and play custom levels. There are also features unlocked after a certain level of game completion. The gameplay consists of moving your spoon with the mouse and pressing the shift key to lower said spoon in the hopes of moving the oatmeal. As you progress, there will be obstacles you must avoid if you want to achieve oatmeal perfection. Good luck.",
