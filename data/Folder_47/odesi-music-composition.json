    "About the game": "ODESI is a music sketchpad that exports your projects to Audio and MIDI Create your next album in Odesi Odesi helps you write hot tracks. It exports the results to Audio and MIDI files, so you can use the final result immediately. The MIDI files you create in Odesi will open perfectly inside Ableton Live, Logic Pro, Reason, Pro Tools, or any other DAW. It doesn’t change your workflow, it just speeds up your creative process because MIDI functions in Odesi are much faster than all music producer software. When you’re done with your Odesi session, you will have a 100% composed track that’s ready for production. All your melodies, basslines and chord progressions will be finished. Here are things you can do: Create music for your band Produce your own tracks in any genre - House, Trap, Hip Hop, Cinematic, Rock, Pop and everything else Create music for your games if you're a game developer Create blueprints for your vocalists to follow Create backing tracks to play guitar and sing to - it's like having studio musicians follow your every move Save both the audio files and the MIDI file so you can take your composition and share it with people A vault of ideas The software is designed for pro musicians, but you can learn how to use it even if you don't have much experience with music production. It'll teach you a lot of techniques used by professional producers and composers to make memorable music. Odesi gives you 138 bassline rhythms that you can use in your own compositions. Some of them have resulted in #1 hits for other artists, and other rhythms are relatively unknown. Dig through the basslines and see what sounds good to you - and then, CUSTOMIZE THEM.
