    "About the game": "Become fully immersed in the firefight! Experience a first person shooter as you never have before: Onward combines mil-sim gameplay with the experience of playing in virtual reality. Players cannot rely on crosshairs or mini maps. Instead, you must rely on coordination and communication with your squad In order to succeed at your objective. Realistic combat mechanics and artificial locomotion will push your combat survival skills to their limit as you engage in infantry combat across a large variety of maps and combat situations. What you’ll find in Onward Solo and co-op game modes Take on AI enemies to hone your skills against our AI opponents. Chase down all enemies in the a Hunt, or hold off the enemy forces as you wait for your extraction in an Evac mission. Explore maps freely or go to the shooting range to familiarise yourself with the wide variety of weapons in the game, all of which are unique and require knowledge to operate. Multiplayer battles with up to ten players Take to the online battlefield in a high stakes clash with up to ten people and best your enemies on a strategic and tactical level. Choose one of three objective based modes where you need to fight for control over an Uplink station, get the VIP to safety (or prevent it), or secure an area long enough to upload a code through your tablet. Two unique factions with a wide variety of weapons Onward focuses the battle between the modern militaristic MARSOC faction which has access to modern weapons including the AUG, M16, M1014 P90 and the M249 light machine gun and the insurgent Volk forces who utilise weapons such as the AKS74U, the Makarov, and even an RPG launcher. This is only a small sample of what awaits in game. Community created content Create your own battlefields in Onward by building custom maps and using them in the game. We actively support the creative forces in our community with developing unique content for the game.",
