Follow the path to nowhere or destroy the walls to give a end for your enemies. Path of Destruction is a round based game, every round you have a opportunity to purchase and sell items before going to the action. Move around gathering items, exploding dynamites, throwing grenades or just shot at the wall, the rule is never stand in the same place. Adquire powerful weapons and bring destruction to the game. We have a few available weapons now: - Glock (Pistol) | Ak47 (Rifle) | M4A1 (Rifle) | MP249 (Heavy Machine Gun) | Katana (Melee) | Baseball Bet (Melee) Create new strategies to get ahead of your enemies Use your resource wisely, don't open a new passage on the labyrinth with explosives if it doesn't lead to new items/resources. Find out combinations of specials (those can be purchased on the shop), you could leave specific items on the map and place mines near it so other players may will fall down. Face not only players but also other environment enemies. There are two times of AI enemies: - Walking [Blue Aliens] | Static [Turrets] Troll your friends with fake items special.
