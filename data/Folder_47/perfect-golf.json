In addition we also have an API to allow anyone to develop a hardware integration to Perfect Golf. Already people in the community are using these API to work on WII integration and other items. We have several official integrations with Launch Monitor companies and Simulator Systems Integrations are also in development. Full Controller Support The game comes with support for almost all controllers. We have not left Controllers as an afterthought, almost everything you can do with a mouse in the game you can do with the controller from moving your ball on the tee to aiming, dropping and moving between main and overhead cameras all without the need to have a pointer on the screen. Multiple Camera Angles We provide the player with many choices for Cameras. From the player camera, to the spectator camera to the follow camera there are many ways to watch the game unfold. In addition we have several different replay cameras to choose from after the shot has finished fully integrated into the multiplayer online experience. Highly customisable Options Whether you want to change the contrast, brightness or saturation of the golf courses, add a little vignetting, set up your sun rays and lens flares, add a sky scattering effect change the weather, change how far back the camera follows the ball etc pretty much everything is configurable inside the game. Multiple Difficulty Levels and Swing Types Perfect Golf offers 5 difficulty levels and unlimited assist customisation to allow anyone to set the game up to play as easy or as difficult as they like. Do you like par to be a challenge or do you want to have a shot at birdie on every hole. Whatever your style Perfect Golf has a setting that will work for you. We also have many different swing types from two swing meters to motion swing with the mouse to real time integrated swing with the controller or mouse. There are several simulation options too. True Time Of Day Configure the time of day you want to play and watch the lighting change as the day progresses. Not only that but everything is accurate to real life as the sun will move at the correct angle and rotation for the course being played assuming the course has been properly georeferenced in Course Forge. Customisable Green Speeds and Course Conditions Perfect Golf offers totally customisable green speeds based on official STIMP measurements from 8 to 14. In addition there are three firmness settings that can be used to set up a different challenge each time you play. The Free Camera At any time engage the free camera and go for a wander around the golf course. While you are waiting for your opponent to hit you could be lining up your putt or taking a look down the hole at the green or simply moving to an aerial view of the course to watch your opponent hit. Our innovative free camera lets you take control of the way you want to watch the round unfold. Perfect Golf has been designed from the outset to be a community driven game with regular content and feature releases based on player feedback. We have spent a long time in early access trying to get the game to be the best golf game on the market. We have incorporated many community suggestions during this process.",
