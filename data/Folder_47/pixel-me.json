    "About the game": "Pixel-Me is probably the most sophisticated pixelart character-generation tool for an almost unlimited number of portraits. Create outstanding pixelart-avatars for your Steam account and social media profiles; create striking images of your friends and family or use it to depict your team or for ingame-artwork. Create hundreds of original characters using a vast array of over 700 elements During the last six years, I handcrafted hundreds of custom pixelart portraits, storing all the different parts created for these images. With a total now of over 700 elements like noses, beards, eyes and the likes this tool will allow you to create billions of diferent images of virtually any person. Just a few of the countless faces you can create with Pixel-Me Random functions for the individual parts of the overall image will help you generate a wide range of different characters and most layers can be activated or hidden, corresponding to your needs. You can move elements up and down, shuffle or deactive them Pixel-Me currently comes with: freely colourable skin 7 colourable Backgrounds 4 Foreheads 6 Necks 48 Chins 15 pairs of Ears 66 pairs of colourable Eyes 37 Noses 117 colourable Lips 186 colourable Hairstyles 50 pairs of colorizable Eyebrows 83 colourable Beards 11 set of colourable Clothes 27 Decorative elements (usable twice) 39 pairs of Glasses The results are yours to use in any way, both personal and commercial. Files are saved as PNGs and editable Pixel-Me files. Trailer-Music: Creative Minds - Bensound",
