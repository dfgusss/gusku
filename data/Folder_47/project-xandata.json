    "About the game": "In Project Xandata, you are a Xandat fighting in a 3v3 arena FPS. Execute chains of movement, gunplay, and elemental skills to test your precision in fast-paced combat. Customize your loadout to fit your Xandat's playstyle and take down your enemies in creative and satisfying ways: jump and slide to a fiery uppercut as Juggernaut and finish with a shotgun; teleport with your Agent's shadow kunai to drop a backstab insta-kill; mark your opponent with Lightning Marksman's arc painter to perfectly land a deadly sniper shot. KEY FEATURES High Impact 3v3 - Being in a team of three gives each player a vital role. A compact team size allows for a good mix of synergy and individual impact. Fast Pace &amp; Movement - The fast-paced gameplay and agile movement allow you to outmaneuver opponents and jump from one fight to the next. Real-time Customization - Adapt to the battlefield anytime. Customize your Xandat's class build even during a match. Elemental Class Skills - MagiTech is the ancient technology that powers the Xandat's elemental skills. Harness the speed of lightning and wind as the Marksman. Misdirect enemies with shadow and Ice as an Agent. Wreak hot havoc or build walls of water as a Juggernaut. Xandat Weapon &amp; Perk System - Raise your pistol's firing rate after a kill. Increase your SMG's stability when you duel. Spot the next target after sniping an enemy. Perfectly track the opponent with your rocket launcher. Choose between 9 weapons and 18 possible perk combinations per weapon and tune them up however you want. 4 GAME MODES Go head-to-head against other Xandats in a variety of game modes. Corruption - Race with the enemy team to collect enough shards. Eliminated players drop 1 shard and the goal is to collect 100 enemy shards to win. Need more shards? Keep your eyes open for the Obelisk that spawns around the map. Destroy it for an extra 8 shards but be careful of the enemy team! Skirmish - Square off in a time-limited skirmish. Every elimination gives 100 base points, but different manners of elimination give extra points. Turn up the skill and the style if you want to reach 5,000 points first and win the game. Overcharge - Secure the discharged battery, bring it to a Lightning Rod, and charge it to 100%. Defend the battery well because the enemy will try their best to steal it from you. Free For All - Friends? What friends? Everyone’s an enemy! LOOK GOOD, PLAY GOOD Collect badass cosmetics–armor sets, weapon skins, emotes, intros, nameplates, and loading screens by leveling up the prestige pass or buying exclusive store items.",
