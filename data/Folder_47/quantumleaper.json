    "About the game": "In Quantumleaper , you’ll use your Superposition ability to solve puzzles that would be otherwise impossible to complete. Duplicate your position with a single button and press it again to switch between your two selves at any time, no matter how far. You can use your other self to activate switches, mislead enemies and block projectiles. Sometimes, even tunnel through walls. As you progress, new components will require you to find new ways to advance – using both intelligence and skill. It’s a huge maze filled with deadly puzzles. How far can you go? Can you find the exit? Can cats really type messages? I mean, of course it’s not an actual cat... But then again, this would be more likely than a human being having quantum properties... There has to be an explanation and there is only one way to find out: the scientific way.",
