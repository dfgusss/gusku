    "About the game": "In Real Winners: Victoryball, you'll operate as a sports robot doing their best to win. Pick up and play rules that change the match and end up with a game that's nothing like where it started. Rules can change everything from the size of the players to adding buzz saws to the field. Fast paced and silly, Real Winners: Victoryball is a great game to pick up and play with friends, relative or frenemies! Real Winners: Victoryball is a 4-player local party game. Real Winners: Victoryball comes with four distinct game modes: Victoryball begins as classic soccer. Kick the ball into the opponents goal. Add a laser fence and a baseball bat for a real challenge. Dodgeball poses the question: What if dodgeballs were also bombs? The answer is: Way more explosions. Trophy Troubles is a free for all where bots scramble to grab the trophy and hold onto it as long as possible. King Of The Hill gets a bit of a twist. This co-op mode finds the bots defending the King Ball from an onslaught of zombots that want to kick him out of his courtly circle. Score often, score loudly.",
