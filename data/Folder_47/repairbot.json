    "About the game": "You are a repair drone aboard an abandoned space station drifting in space. The main skill of your character is to grab various items, such as crates, barrels, and energy cubes, with your magnetic hand and move them across the game world. Use energy cubes to activate various functional objects, such as doors, conveyors, turbines. All of this forms one big puzzle that you will have to solve. The game features a level editor. It's pretty powerful and lets you create your own levels. You can also load a level to the workshop where other players will be able to play it as well.",
