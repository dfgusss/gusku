    "About the game": "Take the Fright to the Streets Monsters, mutants, and the walking dead have taken over! Now it’s up to three fearless brawlers from around the globe to unite and do battle against the horrific forces run amok. Punch, kick, and slam your way through werewolves, mummies, vampires, and even Death himself to eradicate the marauding monstrosities! Take on hordes of frightful foes in this horror-themed beat ‘em up arcade brawler from Data East™. You control one of three fighters whose sole objective is to deliver the beatdown to throngs of classic horror monsters. The full moon is rising — time to show these abominations what a nightmare really looks like! Take on the paranormal menace as metal-armed cyborg Jake, Christopher the vampire hunter, or talented martial artist Hong Hua. Unleash combos, aerial attacks, and special moves on your enemies and watch the gore fly with each devastating impact. Slam bad guys into the ground and kick at their exposed heads for massive damage. Battle through a variety of detailed environments -- clash in the city streets, rumble in the graveyard, do some clobberin’ in a castle, and more! Grab up to two friends for 2-player action! (Requires separate controllers)",
