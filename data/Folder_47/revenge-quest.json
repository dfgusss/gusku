    "About the game": "Introduction: Revenge Quest is a light-hearted side-scrolling shoot-'em-up inspired by Film Noire and Art Deco architecture. You (and your friend) must fight the robotic guards that stand in your way all the way to the boss, using whatever weapons and help you can get, and get revenge! About: The combat in Revenge Quest is fast. You must plan your moves before you attack, and understand the enemy’s patterns before moving out from cover. Each level will require you to come up with your own tactics to get past its challenges. Ever since the drought, the mafia has taken advantage of the scarcity of water by bottling it up down to the last drop and selling it at a steep price. A rag-tag group of rebels, including you, intend to do what it takes to get the rivers flowing again. Key Features: Movable environment. Just about everything in the environment can be moved around to provide dynamic cover and block off enemies Local co-op multiplayer. (Press Backspace to get Player 2 to join) Good thing you were both trained in CPR. You can revive your fallen friend when playing multiplayer A growing selection of classic and strange weapons. Each character brings their weapons of choice to the table Tough bosses. Besides the robotic minions watching the hallways, a well-oiled guardian robot defends each door to prevent intruders from getting too close to the heart of the operation.",
