    "About the game": "In Roma Invicta you have the honor of conquering ancient Gaul with your Roman legions. The game combines action oriented real-time battles with turn-based strategy on the campaign map where you raise, supply and move your armies. The game can best be described as a mixture of the old Amiga classic 'North and South' and the 'Total War' series. Features Experience a lovingly handcrafted scenery of ancient Gaul. Recruit your troops from legionnaires to scorpion artillery to Germanic cavalry. Fight in tactical and action-packed real-time battles with hundreds of individual soldiers. Slow down or pause the battle to always stay in control and give orders with no hurry. Hand over parts of your army to the AI ​​to always keep control even in larger battles. Supply your troops and always pay attention to the changing of the seasons. You decide whether to bring peace to the Gallic villages or whether to plunder them and thus further ignite the resistance against you. Different starting conditions and difficulty levels ensure replay value. Support a hobby game developer in his first commercial game, all done by himself.",
