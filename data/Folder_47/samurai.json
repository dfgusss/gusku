    "About the game": "Samurai is a tricky and tactical turn-based adventure. Take on the Yokai fortress one zone at a time and face increasingly challenging foes in beautiful low-poly Japanese themed environments. Samurai puts you in control of two warriors who together must attempt to storm the fortress of the Yokai. The gameplay takes inspiration from classic turn-based tactics games, with an emphasis on making the most of every move or paying the price. Strategic turn based action: weigh up the effects of every move as you attempt to outmanoeuvre the Yokai forces. Challenging and intimidating enemies: your skills will be tested as ever deadlier and craftier AI enemies stand in your way. Powerful skills: Upgrade your capabilities as you unlock and wield new skills, improving your attacks and giving you more tactical options for achieving victory. Unlimited approaches: Will you focus on sniping from a distance? Will you charge right in with your Katana? Will you cover all the angles and sit back? Experiment with a wide range of playstyles.",
