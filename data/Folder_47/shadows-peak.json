You play as the writer Tom Blair who has decided to visit a mysterious place called Shadows Peak to gather materials for a new book about legends. A number of people have gone missing in Shadows Peak. Some people claim that they saw something that they shouldn’t have been able to see there and, of course, there are some dark legends surrounding this place. Key Features Large environments Non-linear gameplay No hand holding Mysterious story Haunting atmosphere Gamepad support for 50 controllers",
