    "About the game": "Solarium is about plants – in space. You’re in a distant future in a distant galaxy. A race of aliens has cooperated with earthlings to explore the galaxies and document all forms of life for preservation, just in case their home worlds are destroyed. It’s called the Solarium Initiative. The DNA is taken to an intergalactic botanical study center where each environment is painstakingly reconstructed. You are a botanist-in-training from earth, and you must visit the earth environments to learn about their plants before setting out on an actual expedition. Answer skill-testing questions, earn points, overcome challenges, and then build your own custom garden of beautiful and strange plants!",
