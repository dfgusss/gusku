    "About the game": "This game is a singleplayer top-down wave shooter in 2D set in a sci-fi space environment where instead of surviving as long as possible, you actually have to make it through the levels. Aliens have evaded your planet and destroyed everything. Now it is up to you to take revenge. Using your planets first ever created battle space ship you are about to show the invaders all your heavy weaponry. And they are not going to like it! Fight against various alien enemies, collect items and reach the level portal in order to escape to the next level. The current campaign consists of four levels containing a set of waves of enemies you have to fight. After surviving all waves, a portal will open and you can escape to the next level. At the end you will face a boss (fourth level) that you have to fight and defeat in order to win the campaign. Good luck, sir!",
