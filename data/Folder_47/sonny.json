Sonny is designed for cunning and creativity with an emphasis on strategy and difficulty as the gameplay evolves. Featuring stunning artwork by Jet Kimchrea and an engrossing original score by David Orr. Engaging, mysterious storyline full of secrets, conspiracies, and zombies. Combat-focused gameplay with an intuitive interface. Battles with an emphasis on strategy... think your way through it, don't grind. Intriguing party members with their own unique abilities.
