    "About the game": "SuperLuminauts is a local-multiplayer spaceship shooter where your missiles leave trails in time. With the tight controls of an arcade shooter, and the deep mechanics of no other, soon you'll be flying, thinking, and blowing up your friends like a true SuperLuminaut. 2-4 Player Couch Chaos To turn your laptop or living room into a space-time arena, all you need is a keyboard &amp; mouse and another person you don't mind being temporary mortal enemies with. To maximize competitive shouting/gloating, you'll need 2 or more controllers for four players. Superluminal Trails Missiles don't just launch, they trail and richochet and shatter and cascade in a web of space-time. Keep your wits about you and adapt your tactics, or jump headfirst and enjoy the show. A Sci-Fi Rainbow of Ships Though all vehicles are outfitted with the same specs, we all know the coolest ship with the coolest paint job is going to win. 3 New Ways to Play We've scoured the universe of infinite game-modes and we thought these were the most fun ways to demolish the fabric of space-time, and involved the fewest subatomic-combustions and/or lizard-people uprisings. Dive Your trails make the map: each round you dive and spiral deeper into the lattice you build. Chaotic Anomaly Rapid-fire rounds in a shifting arena where trails accelerate after each bounce and insta-kill. Galactic Tour Build a tour from 25 maps, whether it be a 3-round grudge match or a journey across the galaxy and back.",
