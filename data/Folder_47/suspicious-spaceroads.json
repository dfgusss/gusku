    "About the game": "Partake in a platforming romp through a series of increasingly suspicious space roads, now you may be thinking why are these roads hanging in space? Who built them? Why am I platforming here? Inspired heavily by the classic 'Skyroads' and left wanting by other clones, Suspicious Spaceroads aims to give you an experience that you won't soon forget at a price point that is fair. The dot points: Defy the laws of physics Utilize speed and precision to establish dominance over 25 stages. Witness a variety of suspicious, and quite frankly weird, platforming situations. Plethora of neat tricks to discover and exploit. Please enjoy!",
