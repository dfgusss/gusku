    "About the game": "The Adventures of Nick &amp; Willikins is a humorous look at the very British relationship of Master and Manservant as told through the lens of clueless non-British writers. Also, there's a dead body involved and it's up to you to search the posh mansion for clues! Did the Butler do it? It's up to you to find out! Oh, and you're the butler, I should probably mention that. FEATURES An entirely original adventure written by Matt Rowbotham and Ron 'AAlgar' Watt. Features voice performances from Sarcastic Voyage's entire stable of voice actors. Vividly brought to life by artists Meg Casey (Munchkin, Welcome to Showside) and Fred Stresing (Invader Zim [comic], Rocko's Modern Life [comic]). Classic Point &amp; Click interface.",
