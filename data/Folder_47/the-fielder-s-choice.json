    "About the game": "Grab a glove and pitch your way to the top of the major leagues! Baseball season is back and you’re on the mound. Starting your career as a rookie pitcher, you'll develop your repertoire and navigate clubhouse politics in the big leagues. Over eight seasons, you’ll use your talent and charisma to win on--and off--the field. The Fielder’s Choice is a 115,000-word interactive baseball novel by Nathaniel Edwards. It’s entirely text-based—without graphics or sound effects—and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Your talented arm will take you places you’ve never seen, and introduce you to some of the most driven athletes on the planet. Do you have the massive dedication to succeed in the big leagues, or will you resort to a little bit of cheating? Will you be baseball’s biggest stat geek or the master of hustle and grit? Will you develop an on-field persona that terrifies hitters or a cuddly exterior that lulls them to sleep? Will you go down in history as a Hall of Fame ace or a live arm that fizzled on the big stage? When your lifelong baseball dreams come true, someone else may have to lose everything they’ve ever worked toward. Play as male, female, or non-binary; gay or straight Play as left- or right-handed Choose your pitching style and develop the perfect repertoire to rack up strikeouts Perfect a fastball, slider, or curveball Find friends, foes, or potential lifelong partners among your teammates Pitch in the United States, Japan, or unlock the opportunity to explore a new frontier for baseball Use statistical analysis to perfect your game, or #RiseAndGrind to out-hustle your opponents Discover the quirky secret behind baseball’s most successful agent What pitch will you throw when the game is on the line?
