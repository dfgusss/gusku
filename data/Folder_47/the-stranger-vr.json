    "About the game": "The Great War has changed everything. Our dimensions were crushed; our world was shattered... But we have survived... The world was nearly destroyed by machines from parallel dimension 3000 years ago in a great battle which the ancients called The Rift War . Now what left of mankind lives underground and only with the genes of our commanding Lord Fathers can reach the surface and fight to reclaim our land... They call these people; Strangers. The Stranger is an Epic Games Megagrants awarded, very intense VR combat game made by 3 people that sets in an incredibly detailed exotic world . You are the Stranger of your generation. You are alone in a hostile world. All you have are your weapons, your protective suit and your courage. FEATURES - 7 Weapons in 25 modes with customizations. - 15 different types of enemies. - Beautifully designed and very detailed 12 levels with an average total playtime of 6 hours. - Very easy and comfortable free locomotion &amp; teleport systems. - Super fast gameplay. The Stranger is like Doom™ in vast, open environments. - A rocking soundtrack by Alexander Brandon &amp; Michiel Van Den Bos ; original composers of Unreal Tournament™ and Deus Ex™ .",
