    "About the game": "This is a derivative fan-work of the Touhou Project series and is not affiliated with Team Shanghai Alice. Remember to support the official games on Steam. Take on a menacing boss with nothing but your gun, your reflexes, and your other, bigger gun in this short, arcade-style, lightgun game! Originally developed in 72 hours for the 6th Touhou Fan Game Jam, the game has since been polished into a complete experience! Story One leisurely spring day, a large crate landed in a certain shrine courtyard, piquing the curiosity of a shrine maiden and her magician friend lounging nearby. Inside were some guns and a treasure trove of ammunition. Unfamiliar with kinetic warfare, the two girls treated the weapons as toys and played until the sun went down. It was then that a rare guest made a surprise visit to the shrine gates. 'So anyway, I started blastin'' , said the shrine maiden, recalling the incident. Also there are UFOs, but don't think about it. It's probably another Myouren Temple conspiracy. Two Playable Characters: Play as either Reimu with her powerful shotgun, or as Marisa with her full-auto assault rifle! Online Co-Op and Versus Modes: Bring along a friend to take out the boss together! If you're feeling competitive, compete with each other for a high score! Built for Lightgun Play: Everything from the gameplay, to the user interface itself, has been designed by a lightgun user, for lightgun users! Gameplay Modifiers: Hard mode? Lunatic mode? Easy Modo??? Make your own dang difficulty level! You can live out your power fantasy with infinite lives! Alternatively, you can just give yourself 1 life, you masochist !",
