    "About the game": "Trash Patrol is a cooperative multiplayer game for 2-4 players. You and one or more of your friends break into a house. Your goal: Steal every item within the given time! But be aware of the homeowner! They do not condone raccoons running around their house and trashing it! If they spot you: Run! This is not a dirty Job! Raccoons want everything clean. You don't want any dirty goods, do you? That's why all items need to be washed and dried carefully. Afterward, throw them in your teleporting trashcan. Why the trashcan is teleporting around? We have no clue what you did to it! Also, watch out for the dirty hands of the humans. Don’t let them touch your precious trash! Cooperation is Key Do you want to snatch the toaster from the shelf? Or the gnome from the desk? And you can’t reach the items? Grab a teammate and throw them in the air! Higher spots can only be reached together. Whether you are collecting items, washing them, or baiting the human - only teamwork makes the dream work! You outsmart every human and return the stolen goods to those who deserve them: You!
