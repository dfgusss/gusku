    "About the game": "'Danger, Will Robinson!' Filled with bugs, shorter than you want it to be, lacking features you crave, and just *not* fully tuned yet - this alpha release may infect your brain and leave you curled, twitching in a corner, while you jones for more zombie goodness. Play at your own risk! That having been said . . . Raw, aggressive hunger - there's nothing like being a Zombie when you want to do some damage! Now you can control your own horde of zombies and lay waste to the tidy world that humans have created for themselves. Feast on their brains, grow, mutate, and gain incredible powers. Take over a small town (deputies are delicious!). Overwhelm the arriving SWAT units, gather civilian bodies, and reduce a mighty city to rubble. Feast on the remains of generals as their weapons lie smoldering and scattered. Undead Overlord is the world's most succulent Zombie Dominion RTS. Zoom into a world where destruction is the goal. Mindless zombies? Not when you are the controlling Mind! We’re proud to make our Alpha1 build available on Steam Early Access. The game was approved for distribution on Steam through the Greenlight program last fall, after just over a month’s worth of voting, but the game still needed more work at that point. The fact of the matter is - it *still* needs more work! You all know about Beta software. Well . . . Alpha comes before Beta, so it's full of crawling bugs and creeping inconsistencies that we haven't had time to stomp out just yet - but you can help us do the stomping, and have some fun in the process! Alpha1.16 lets you experience the beginnings of the reign of the Undead Overlord with the first five story missions, two skirmish maps, and a special alphaTest map available to those who take part in the game’s Early Access program. Play the game like you're riding a bucking bronco - ride that sucker into submission. Then participate in forum discussions on the current state of the game, have your say, and join us as we add more missions, more maps, new features, and work towards a full release.
