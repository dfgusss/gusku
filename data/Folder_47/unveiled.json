    "About the game": "Can't feel a thing, can't see a thing. Can't help but wonder 'What exactly is going on?'. Confused, you heard a voice calling out to you telling you more about your current situation while proclaiming to be a 'God' telling you that you are dead. Offering a chance to live once again, you took it while thinking 'Is this going to go well?'. Unveiled is a visual novel game with a unique twist of having a turn based strategy added in it. The story is taken from the super popular Isekai genre from Japan, about a boy who died and reincarnated in a fantasy world. - Story like no other : A handwritten story made of more than 10000+ words! Explore more about what will happen after being reincarnated! - Choices : Choose what you want to reply, who doesn't love making good decisions?.. Or bad, or even worse a stupid one? - Turn based combat : Battle monsters and demons roaming the wild alone, or with a group! In a fully turn based combat. - Buffs and debuffs : Think one step ahead, and prepare the correct buffs to withstand an enemy attack, or deal a huge amount of damage and take down your enemies! - Bestiary : Find out more info about what you meet and fight, down to the finest details in your bestiary! Unveiled is a passion project made by a single university student who's just Another Indie Game Dev , and an art enthusiast, with the power of sleep deprivation and minimum amount of budget.",
