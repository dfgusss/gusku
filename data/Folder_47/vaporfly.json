    "About the game": "Do you just want to chill out while you stare at gorgeous visuals at screen and listen to some chill vibes? Well look no further, VaporFly is the game just built for that task. Put on your headset and rev up your engine in Normie Mode to chill and relax. If you want some challenge you can always boot up Vapor Mode as you try to weave thru waves of traffic. Not satisfied? then go into settings and toggle 'Carnage Mode' and experience some real carnage as all things try to send you to hell with their bullets, you'll be equipped with a blaster and a shield as well so you can blast your way thru! We recommend you to use a headset while you play the game. VaporFly is a vapor/synthwave themed music and atmosphere oriented endless runner/music experience. All the music is from the amazing artist Tova. Make sure to check all of her albums if you liked the game! ()",
