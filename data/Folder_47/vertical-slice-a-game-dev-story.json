    "About the game": "Vertical Slice: A Game Dev Story is a life simulation and management game that invites you to experience the life of a game developer: start from scratch as a one-man studio and take off from there to become a successful game producer in a 3 years-long journey! Experience the trials and tribulations of this hard job on your own and, also, supervising a small team where everyone counts on your organization and leadership skills. Work hard every day to develop a successful game that catapults you to the stardom of games in a reasonable time. As the leader of your studio (sometimes caricatured as a talking cat) you have to organize its members’ work – but also care about your own welfare. It’s easy to forget the world when you’re developing a game, so make sure your developer eats, sleeps, exercises his body and has fun, so his physical and mental health doesn’t suffer. But even when you’re living the dream of being a game developer, there’s more to life than work: you’ll meet people while hanging around, and it will be up to you if you work on your personal skills to be likable enough, and if you want to dig deeper into their lives and stories. You decide what kind of game producer you want to be in this slice-of-life story! KEY FEATURES Take decisions in game development. What art style fits your vision better for the game? Which music suits the mood and setting? You’ll need to take a lot of decisions and work hard to push the game forward and make it shine so the audience notices it. Keep learning! Lots of different skills are involved in developing a game: programming, game design, music, art… In Vertical Slice, you can develop any game you want -- as long as you have the skills required to do it, so keep learning and improve your skills to make the game of your dreams! Find a way to make money. Making games takes a lot of money: food, rent, study, and of course your team’s salaries are all essential parts of the budget. What will you do to fund your project? You can accept outsourcing contracts to make some quick money, and once your game is released, there are different ways for you to increase your revenue… Build a talented team. Hire staff to help you develop the game, filling your ranks with talent in areas such as programming, narrative design, game design, art, music… But you’ll have to take budget restrains into account -- you can’t hire an all-star team if you can’t afford to pay them! There’s more to games than work! After work, you can hang out with friends and meet new people from different industries. Be nice with them -- you never know who will be in the position to help you in the future! Endless mode: a new feature added now on full release, Endless Mode is a sandbox experience that keeps going after you’ve ended the 3-years long story mode. Keep working as a studio leader, create more games and earn more money to write your name in golden letters in the history of games!",
