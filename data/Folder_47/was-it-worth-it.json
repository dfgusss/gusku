    "About the game": "Was It Worth It? is a first person, story driven, walking simulator. You wake up in a different world in a robot body as Subject 105. You meet Terry, an A.I and they welcome you to the simulation you find yourself in. Your task is to do as Terry says and answer the questions given to you. These questions will build your new reality. DO NOT go off the path, explore, or ignore Terry. Just do as you're told and enjoy the pretty scenery. What happens when you don't listen? We simply start over. There is no escape.",
