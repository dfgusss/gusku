    "About the game": "You are harassed at school, your friends are avoiding you, and you need to make sure your sister is safe from the dangers that surround you. You've only got a week before high school graduation and everything seems to be falling apart. How will you respond and can you hold your friendships and family together for one more week? Explore the life of Aaron growing up on Chicago's south side as you find out who to trust and how to stay safe. Over the course of a week you must stand up to violence, grow closer to your family and friends, and discover more about yourself and the world around you. We Are Chicago is based on in-depth first person interviews that are interwoven into the game's story. We have worked tirelessly to understand and accurately portray the nuances of the characters’ relationships and struggles. Inspire Change In an effort to support the neighborhoods we feature in the game, half of the proceeds from We Are Chicago will support the All Stars Project of Chicago and Reclaim Our Kids, two non-profit groups who's mission is to help curb violence and provide positive and creative opportunities to people living on Chicago’s south and west side. Above all, we hope that We Are Chicago will create a deeper understanding, motivate and inspire change, and cultivate a larger conversation surrounding the issues of violence and income disparity. Features Powerful and moving narrative driven game for PC. Experience a side of Chicago that you've never seen before. Make choices to help protect your family and keep your friends. Enjoy music from local artists that live and grew up on Chicago's south and west side. Journey through true life events gathered from members of the community.",
