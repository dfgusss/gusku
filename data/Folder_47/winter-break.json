FEATURES : Adults &amp; kids friendly game Winter Break is family and casual friendly: there’s no blood and the player character can’t die. In addition, some of the game mechanics help the youngest of us by providing them advantages to compete with the adults! Casual PVP If you’re more entitled to compete against your friends and family, Winter Break provides a fun yet competitive experience thanks to its scoring system and the aiming skills it requires. Winter amusement park The action takes place in a cartoony wintery amusement park with many different activities to choose from! In addition to shooting other players, there are plenty of mini-challenges: from ‘whack-a-mole’ to the golden snitch. Snowball slingshot Fully fledged and reactive slingshot to throw snowballs at your opponents! Fully developed for VR Winter Break has been fully developed for VR from the ground up, using scientific research to back up the design decisions. No motion sickness Winter Break provides a completely immersive VR experience without motion sickness. (note: Some people might be experiencing motion sickness for other reasons than gameplay) Highly polished gamefeel From interacting with objects to using slingshot, all of the actions you perform and activities you take part in have been highly polished to feel and sound like a satisfying, fun and cute toy. Size adaptability Dodging enemy snowball is based on your real body. If you crouch, you’re likely to evade that pesky snowball heading towards your face. But what if you’re the tallest man on Earth? No worries! The game provides a size adaptation feature that makes all players even! Accessibility Winter Break has been designed to be played in a 180 degree radius in front of the player and allow sit-gaming. This makes persons with disabilities able to play and enjoy the game like anyone else!",
