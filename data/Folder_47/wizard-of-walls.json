    "About the game": "' Wizard Of Walls ' is a dungeon/maze shooter with retro mechanics inspired by the old arcade classic ' Wizard Of Wor '. You play a warrior with a laser gun and have to shoot all monsters. If you touch a monster or get shot by a monster, you die instantly (no health bar, no regeneration). Everything becomes faster and faster. Your goal is to survive as many dungeons as you can. Multiplayer local, online and mixed You can play coop or PvP with up to 4 players. Local multiplayer and online are combinable. For example, you can play together with 2 players on one machine and 2 players on another machine via internet. You can also invite your steam friends or join their lobbies. Power-Ups Collect power-ups within the dungeon. The blue ones make you run faster, the orange ones make you shoot faster Spider Dungeons Every 5th dungeon is a spider dungeon. A horde of fast moving spiders crawl around and try to drop eggs. If you don't shoot the eggs in time, 5 new spiders will be born. Leaderboard The leaderboard shows the top 100 single player warriors and the top 100 team scores in coop games (for 2, 3 or 4 players)",
