    "About the game": "Welcome to Word Wise! Word Wise is designed to be a simple game where you sit back, relax, and make words.

While hovering over a tile with the mouse cursor, the tile will be highlighted and you will have the option to select it. Note that certain tile types can not be selected, and selecting tiles is unavailable in some cases (e.g., when the board is replenishing). Drag the mouse over several tiles to begin making a word! Valid Words If the word is a valid word, the selected tiles will be highlighted in green, otherwise they will be highlighted in orange-red. The directional arrows that indicate the flow of the word being made will also change colour as an indication of validity. Note that a word must be at least 3 letters long to be considered valid A valid word An invalid word Points You may have noticed the numbers on the tile faces. These numbers indicate the points value for that tile. A preview of the full word you are making will appear on the top of the screen. On the bottom of the screen, a breakdown of the points including the total word score will be shown. Once a word is made, the points of the tiles used are added to your score. The top right of the screen shows your score, and the bottom left shows your level. You go up a level every 1,000 tiles used Marking Tiles When making long words, you will need to keep tiles on the board without using them. You will make words in order to drop desired tiles into position to be later used in said long word. However it is easy to accidentally move, or even use these reserved tiles. For this purpose there is a feature where you may double-click on any tile to mark it. Marked tiles will be highlighted in a magenta colour, making it easier to keep track of them Getting a Closer Look You may find it helpful to get a closer look at the board. At any time you can use the mouse wheel to zoom into the board. While zoomed in, you may use the middle or right mouse buttons to pan across the board. Zooming out will automatically re-center the board Tile Types In the game there are 7 types of tile, these include wood, bronze, silver, gold, diamond, bomb, and burning. Non-wood tiles are known as special tiles. Bronze, silver, gold, and diamond are the most common special tiles you will encounter. You may have noticed they do not have a face value, this is because they work a bit differently. Bronze, silver, gold, and diamond have a 0 value, however they will multiply the score of your word by 2, 3, 4, and 5 respectively. This will be reflected in the points breakdown, where the multiplier values will themselves be multiplied together if multiple special tiles are used. Bronze, silver, gold, diamond, and bombs will appear when words are made with scores greater than or equal to 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 points respectively. When special tiles are earned, one will always appear, however this one and subsequent tiles will only have a 50% chance of spawning an additional special tile. Special tiles can appear anywhere, even over existing special tiles, so use them up before you risk finding your hard-earned diamond turning into bronze! Furthermore every tile that spawns to replenish the board has a 1% chance of being any of the special tile types Bombs Bombs are unique, they are the only type of tile that can not be selected. A bomb will explode should any word be made that is directly adjacent to it. When a bomb explodes, it will destroy nearby tiles, and you may notice burning tiles are left behind. The points value of any exploded tiles will be added to your score. Burning tiles are tiles that were caught on fire from the explosion, use them up quickly, because they have a chance to spread with every new word made! Note that burning tiles have a multiplier of 0, and will nullify the score of any words made with them A bomb A burning tile spreading to another tile UI Options There are several buttons in the top left of the screen First we have the exit button, this just brings you back to the menu Next is the info button. From here you can discover plenty of fun statistics about your word making including amount of words made, amount of tiles used, average score per word, etc. You can also check words to see if they exist in the lexicon, which is especially useful for making long words The third button is for settings. Here you can do many things including volume control, determining what genres of music will play, and adding or excluding your own custom words. Note that although identical to the settings screen in the main menu, this screen also contains an option to show the FPS of your game Lastly are the shuffle and rejuvenate buttons. A shuffle can be done an unlimited amount of times, and will shuffle around the tiles on the board. A rejuvenate will completely replace all of the tiles on the board, however these are in limited supply. Every time you level up, you will earn an additional 2 rejuvenates That's it! Word Wise has over 7 hours of music over 5 genres, so sit back, relax, make words, and earn points! Happy word making!",
