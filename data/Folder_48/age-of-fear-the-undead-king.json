Whether you choose to protect the King's lands or work to destroy them, an adventure of epic proportions awaits! AGE OF FEAR is a long-running series of fantasy turn-based strategy games loved by fans for its tabletop wargame battle system and in-depth RPG customization. Age of Fear: The Undead King is the first foray into the series' deeply tactical gameplay with two campaigns to choose from. (scroll down for a list of features and selected mods) FEATURE LIST ⭐ HEX-FREE BATTLES - test your tactics with a novel movement system where size matters and units aren't constrained by artificial grids! ⭐ ALIGNMENTS such as Evil and Holy. Units from opposite sides won’t like each other and may desert. A bit of diplomacy (or charisma!) is needed to manage such relationships. ⭐ EXTENDED STORY including many sub-quests, optional events, alternative endings, more detailed lore, etc. ⭐ FREQUENTLY UPDATED - we take our work seriously and patch our games often with new features and content. Also, whenever possible, those updates are back-ported to all our previous games! ⭐ COMMUNITY-DRIVEN - we listen to our players and continuously improve! Go and check our forums, everyone has their say and we implement those suggestions. ⭐ FULL OF JOKES - who said strategy games have to be serious? All the best fantasy jokes have a home here! ⭐ PARTY CUSTOMIZATION - build and upgrade a custom army from more than two hundred unique units, skills and spells (but be aware of racial animosities!). ⭐ DEEP BATTLE MECHANICS - learn the basics in a hurry, then develop new strategies around a huge variety skills, spells and battle hazards like neutral factions and environmental effects (yes, you can anger bystanders!). ⭐ EASY TO MOD - create your own missions, or even full-fledged campaigns, to be shared with the Steam community! ⭐ FANTASY STORYTELLING - get wrapped up in two separate storylines featuring a motley crew of characters, globetrotting adventures and fantasy shenanigans galore. All hand-illustrated! ⭐ PERMANENT DEATH - accept the grim realities of death where all units that fall in battle stay dead... unless an evil Necromancer raises them as Zombies. ⭐ ARTEFACTS AND RELICS - discover numerous unique weapons, armours, potions and treasures, with the rarest granting powerful OP skills and stat bonuses. ⭐ ADVANCED AI - our AI is built upon a self-organizing network of agents and meta-heuristics algorithms (yes, we are PhD-smart!). Discover one of the most sophisticated AI systems you've ever played against! ⭐ LOW HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS - run the game even on that old potato laptop of yours. Your stone-age computer is good enough! ⭐ COLOR-BLIND MODE - a special mode with higher contrast and outlined fonts. ⭐ ...everything else we come up with!
