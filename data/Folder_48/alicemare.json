    "About the game": "Alicemare is a somehow familiar yet totally unique adventure game with strong horror leanings, created by △○□× (Miwashiba) using the WOLF RPG Editor. ~STORY~ Allen is a young boy who has lost his memory. Bereaved by the loss of his mother and father, he eventually ends up at a home for lost children. One day, he sets out to investigate a rumor heard from the other children. This is where Allen’s story really begins... ~WHAT KIND OF A GAME?~ Alicemare is an adventure game blending elements of exploration, storybooks and fairytales, and just a hint of horror. Those with an aversion to horror need not worry; this title only includes subtle touches of the genre here and there. There are no survival-horror elements to the gameplay nor the story, and you can rest assured that the only thing keeping you up at night will be your enjoyment of the game. ~CHARACTERS~ ◆Allen A young boy who has tragically lost both his memory and his parents. He likes books and newspapers. ◆Letty &amp; Rick Letty is a young girl with a bright and energetic personality. Rick, her twin, is a boy who looks exactly like Letty. ◆Chelsy A shy little girl. Chelsy loves her teddy bears. ◆Joshua A mischievous young boy who likes to cause trouble. Joshua is currently obsessed with frogs. ◆Stella A curious little girl with an unreadable face. Stella is always thinking to herself silently. ◆Teacher A male teacher at the children’s home where Allen lives. He is searching for something―but what, and why...? ◆White Rabbit The White Rabbit technically fills the role of Allen’s guide. However, he seems to have little interest in actually “guiding”. ◆Cheshire Cat The Cheshire Cat is another character who guides Allen along on his journey. He has the ability to appear and disappear at will, and is characterized by his very peculiar manner of speaking.",
