    "About the game": "Ambidangerous is a top-down shooter that puts your ambidexterity to the test. Simultaneously control two elite soldiers as you fight your way through four randomized areas, five unique bosses, and a dozen enemy types. Take the challenge alone or share the controller with a friend for co-op play. You play as Amy and Dexter, two elite soldiers on a mission to rescue the rest of their unit after crash landing on a remote island research facility. A strange aura emanating from the island has turned the its residents into violent monsters, both organic and mechanical. Control two soldiers simultaneously--one with each hand Want to play with a friend? No problem. Couch co-op is supported with one or two controllers. 7 different weapons 4 randomized levels, completed in any order you wish 5 unique bosses, each challenges your ambidexterity in a different way 4 unlockable perks Original soundtrack by Reed Russel full of absolute bangers 100% original pixel art Feeling hardcore? Put your ambidextrous skills to the test in the perma-death Speedrun Mode Inspired by games like The Binding of Isaac , Hotline Miami , and the original Legend of Zelda Ambidangerous is a game about ambidexterity (using both left and right hands), so enemies and weapons are designed with two-handed play in mind. However, you can opt to play in Amputee Mode , which lets you progress through the game with just one hand. Perfect if you're missing a hand, sipping a beer, or holding a baby. IMPORTANT: This game uses a special control scheme that requires an Xbox-style (X-input) gamepad with two joysticks. It cannot be played with a keyboard and mouse.",
