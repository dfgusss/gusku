    "About the game": "BIG POTATO IS UP ON THE BIG SCREEN Roll out the red carpet, you and your friends are about to play a Big Potato party game on the BIG SCREEN! It might sound like magic, but guess what — it isn't! In fact, it's easy as 1, 2, 3: 1. Round up the players and gather around the TV, laptop or tablet. 2. Grab your phones, scan the code to join the game and pick a Potato Skin. 3. Use your phone as a controller as you write, draw and moo your way to victory. THREE FAMILY-FRIENDLY PARTY STARTERS We've taken three of our family-favorite party games, turned them 2D and squeezed into a party pack together, inside you'll find: Herd Mentality: A `think like the herd` party game with one black and white mission — write down the same answer as everyone else. Watch out for the angry pink cow! Scrawl: The official drawing game for terrible artists. Doodle a weird phrase, pass it on and watch as things start to go very, very wrong. Can of Squirms: Look your friend in the eyes and silently answer questions like, 'Which one of us would start the best cult?' If you agree, the points are yours! Using your smartphone to play a party game on the TV. What a time to be alive!",
