    "About the game": "BlueFear is a sea survival game. 'Build your own ship and be prepared for what's about to come.' You and your crew have crash-landed on an island. Waking up, you realize there is no one around. Something’s not right. This is a life-or-death situation. After weeks of hard work and rummaging through piles of the scraps scattered about, you now have your own survival boat to take you to somewhere safe. You set sail for the distant islands looming before your eyes. After many days at sea, your food and water has run out. There is nothing left to keep you going. Then, all of sudden, you see an island. When you come ashore to see the trees blowing in the wind, you let out a sigh of relief, not knowing the worst is yet to come.
