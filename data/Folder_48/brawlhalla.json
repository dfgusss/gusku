How we do Free to Play Brawlhalla will always be 100% free to play with no pay-to-win advantages and no in-game purchases to keep you from the action. Everything you can buy with real money is cosmetic (such as character skins, podiums, and KO effects) and none of them effect gameplay. The Legend Rotation of nine free to play characters changes every week, and you can earn gold to unlock more Legends by playing any online game mode. You can also check out our “All Legends Pack” that immediately unlocks every character we’ve ever made, and ever will make. Forever. Everything in the “Legends” tab in the in-game store would be yours to have. Note that this doesn’t unlock Crossovers. Here's what you can expect from Brawlhalla Weekly patches and updates. Online, custom, ranked, and local play modes. Over 50 Legends (and counting) to chose from and a free 9 character weekly rotation, unlockable with gold earned through playing the game. Loads of stages to fight on. Unique signature moves, weapon combinations and stats for each character. Ranked seasons every three months with seasonal rewards for playing ranked. A constant stream of new features, balance tweaks and Legends to make the game better and better. Excited Devs active everywhere eagerly listening to what you think! Our eternal thanks (you're our favorite). We’re always listening to community feedback and value what players are telling us. Throughout Early Access the Brawlhalla community helped steer the direction of development multiple times to make Brawlhalla the best it can be. That will remain the same as we continue to improve, expand, and adjust Brawlhalla based on community feedback post-launch.",
