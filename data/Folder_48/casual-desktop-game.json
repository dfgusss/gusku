Do you want to relieve stress by going rampage on your desktop? Are you a fan of the ancient desktop destroyer and want to dwell in memories? Then this game is the right choice for you! Casual Desktop Game is a fanmade revival of the ancient Desktop Destroyer game where you can 'destroy' your screen with various tools. Or you can lend back and watch entities taking combat on your Desktop. As a developer you might also want to be interested in creating your own tool using AngelScript. You can share your tool via the Steam Workshop. Keys: Use: Left mouse button (Use the selected tool) Move: Ctrl + left mouse button to select, left mouse button to move (move an entity) Clean: Right mouse button (Clean your 'work') Menu: TAB (Handle tools, Workshop items, screenshots and view news) Team: Space (Change tool team if applicable) Screenshot: F10 (Saves a screenshot to disk) Console: F11 (A handy tool for developers, e.g., to view scripting errors) Exit: ESC (Exits the game)",
