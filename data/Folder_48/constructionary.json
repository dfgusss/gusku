    "About the game": "Ever think of yourself as having a sharp eye? Or good at explaining stuff with pictures? Time to put your skills to the test in this fast-paced party game. While one player wears the VR headset and builds something out of blocks using their hands, the other players try to guess what they’re making. Is it a house? A snake? A bowtie? Who knows! This modern twist on the classic Charades formula is jam-packed with different modes, features, and of course words, so that there’s always a new way to play. Features include: A unique block-based building system - easy to understand, even if you’re new to VR. Three different game modes - player vs. player, team vs. team, and co-op. Over a thousand built in words and phrases, carefully chosen to work well with the building pieces given. Extra features like hidden pieces, and first-person camera, that keep things interesting. Guides and tutorials so that even people with no VR experience can play and have fun.",
