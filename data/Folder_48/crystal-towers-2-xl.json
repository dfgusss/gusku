    "About the game": "Crystal Towers 2 XL is an adventure platform game inspired by the shareware of the 90s. Join Bernard the monk as he makes his way through the hostile reaches of the kingdom on a quest to recover the sacred instruments that hold the world's music together. This XL edition is a partially remade version of the original game from 2011, adapting the game for widescreen as well as improving a host of things that were missing the first time around. Featuring! Nearly 300 individual challenges, enough to last more than your lifetime (if you're a medium-sized insect) Steam Achievements - some of which aren't patronizing and useless! Absolutely no water or ice levels! The Synthesizer, which lets you create magic artefacts to help you on your quest with mere hours of grinding for items! Use the Music Castle's free wifi to post your scorecard online and laugh at your lesser friends! The engine behind Five Nights at Freddy's doing something that isn't lastingly traumatic! Programmer art galore!",
