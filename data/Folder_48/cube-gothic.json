    "About the game": "Cube Gothic is a horizontal side scrolling shoot 'em up game with strong adventure elements (relatively wordy dialogues, puzzles, mini-games). You take the role of a nameless undead demon fighting the surreal Dark Tower and the First vampire waiting for you at the top. Fight the ancient God and win a Pyrrhic victory. Features: Hand-drawn graphics (with some pre-rendered 3D) Progressive Gothic-esque soundtrack Arcade style Action with balanced difficulty - can be hard, can be easy. Normal people can play it too! Yes, Normal people can play it too - instead of the old 3 lives you have 99 HP and med-kits flying at you occasionally. Unexpected puzzles! Organically integrated Mini games (side scrolling platformer, top-down perspective shoot 'em up, a mine-sweeper-like, etc...) 50+ Bestiary and other hazards A surreal story that makes sense.",
