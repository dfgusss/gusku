    "About the game": "Get all your friends together, meet new people from all over the world, and help each other through thousands of maps! Play with your best friend and beat worldwide records! DDraceNetwork (DDNet) started out as a simple modification of Teeworlds, a 2D action shooter. But, in DDNet, you don't fight against each other - instead, you work together with up to 64 people and push your way through maps. You will see the best and worst in your teammates when they save you from certain death or leave you behind in the dust. We've developed DDNet for over 7 years now and made it greater than ever! It has been free-to-play and free-to-win since development started and will always stay free. It's also open source, so everyone is invited to help improve it with great new ideas! Collect cool weapons, each with their own purpose, and use them to save your teammates. Use your grappling hook to climb through tunnels and up mountains. DDNet requires a lot of skill, coordination and practice. Our friendly online community will help you fall in love with this unique cooperative game. Feeling creative? Custom maps can be built in the editor. An active community contributes new great maps every month, adding to DDNet's collection of thousands of maps. Official DDNet servers run in Germany, France, Poland, USA, Canada, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Chile, Brazil, South Africa and Australia. They're all connected, so you can compare ranks with players around the world. Download DDNet today and compete for ranks worldwide!",
