    "About the game": "About Diesel Power is inspired by classic arcade games and not designed to let the player 'finish by default'. It is best described with the words: challenging and merciless. The goal is simple: Get to the end of the track The challenge: There is no track While trying to keep the hover car on track, you need to find triggers to spawn the next section of the road. Don't dawdle as foes or even the track itself will end your game early. Experts are able to collect extra points and find secrets paths to top the leaderboard. Sounds easy? Handling the controler and the looks via HMD requires motoric skills which will hinder most to get past the first corners. An excessive use of the quick restart function is inevitable for everyone Features Gameplay designed exclusively for VR One single level; no checkpoints Online Crossplatform Leaderboards Smooth &amp; constant 90fps on min specs Oculus Rift (full support including Oculus Universal Menu) HTC Vive SteamVR Experimental: Motion Controllers are used like standard game controllers. There is no hand motion gameplay!",
