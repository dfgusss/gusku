    "About the game": "Double Jump is a classic style easy to pick up 2d platformer experience for you and a friend. Test the strength of your bond by playing together in this challenging world where if one of you makes a mistake, it could mean losing lots of progress! Don't worry though, if the strength of your bond is perfectly synergistic, this game is easy as pie! And remember if ever you make a mistake, it wasn't you, it was that pesky doofus you're playing with. BEFORE YOU BUY: THIS GAME WAS DESIGNED WITH TWO PLAYERS IN MIND. YOU ABSOLUTELY CAN PLAY SINGLE PLAYER BUT THE GAME WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER, AS MOST OF THE CHALLENGE COMES FROM STAYING IN SYNC WITH THE OTHER PLAYER.",
