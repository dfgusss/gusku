    "About the game": "Who am I? Nobody important, nobody you have heard of... yet. My family having little wealth or prestige to offer me, I set out into the world to seek my fortune as an adventurer. And where else would I go, but to Dungeon City? Picking up what few skills and knowledge I could along the way, I have finally arrived to challenge its famous dungeons. The stories tell of great treasures buried within, of gold, magical armaments, and wonders undreamt of elsewhere in the world. Dungeon City is truly the place where legends are made! And my legend begins today... DungeonEpic is an old-school Roguelike with a few modern twists. Set high in the mountains, Dungeon City is famed worldwide for its mystical dungeons, and hopeful adventurers come from throughout the land to test their skill and seek their fortune within. The city is overseen by the mysterious Council of Dungeon Masters who, rumor has it, not only watch over the dungeons, but also have a hand in their creation. And it is said that from time to time, adventurers who manage to impress the Council of Dungeon Masters with their prowess have been invited to join them... Discover the secrets of the dungeons! No level cap or multiclassing restrictions. Unlock new classes through creative thinking. Master the magic and skill systems that start out simple, then grow deeper and more complex as you level up. Your character will permanently grow in power with each completed dungeon, so plan your long-term build carefully. Figure out the secret of becoming a Dungeon Master, and you can build your own dungeons for other players to challenge!",
