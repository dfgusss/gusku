    "About the game": "You are a punk rock band from New York City. You've just finished your debut album and tour starts tomorrow...but someone has stolen your equipment!! Track down the thieves and defeat anyone who stands in your path to rock and roll glory!! Ellen and the Degenerates RPG is a turn based RPG battler for Windows and Mac systems. Features: MS Paint Graphics. Ripping soundtrack composed by the band and the games creator. Hardcore mode for those seeking a challenge. Animal friends to help you on your journey. Game probably runs on crappy computers. Made by me, I play the bass. Roughly 1 hour of gameplay per playthrough. Ellen and the Degenerates are a real actual band from New York City. Get to the gig!",
