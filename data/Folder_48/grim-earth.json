    "About the game": "OMG, look at the Earth ... it's Grim! Grim Earth is a 2D platform game inspired by SNES/Amiga era gameplay, with a blend of action, exploration and puzzle solving. It features hand drawn art, a dry sense of humour and is free of bloody gore ... although there are plenty of explosions, alien splats and flying robot parts! 5000 years from now, a series of apocalyptic events have shaped our once beautiful home into an entirely different world. It's not all bad news though. Countless alien invasions have made it a vibrant place to live and biodiversity is at an all time high, although most of it is not too friendly and should be avoided. Featuring hand-drawn art and keyboard-typed code, created over five years by a single developer ... help! Master the Upgrade Transport Network to reach new heights, but watch out for hacked terminals or you'll pop! Unlock hidden chests to collect and share reality-altering hexadecimal codes. Is this all just a simulation? Explore XP locked areas and speed through timed challenges: designed for the more experienced adventurer. Super realistic physics: you can't fall from an infinite height without consequences. All those other games were lying to you! Customize your spacesuit, maybe cos-play as a bee ... or even an ant? Grab your spacesuit (the air's not so great) and go on a retro-platform-game adventure!",
