    "Release date": "Feb 28, 2020",
    "About the game": "Holodance was the first VR rhythm game shown to the public, mid 2015, and released into Early Access as one of the first two VR rhythm games April 5, 2016. Since then, it has evolved from 'Dancing with Dragons' with only a few songs specifically produced for the game in its environmentalism themed Story Mode (WIP, see Early Access), to also letting you play your local music library as well as any of the 60,000 ranked maps for osu! for more than 12,000 songs in Holodance Free Mode: Play in 20 diverse environments, ranging from a tropical beach or underwater environment with dolphins and whales, to trippy abstract tunnels or asteroid fields: Whether you follow our friendly dragons down the rabbit hole of a potential dystopic future, and get to fistbump Pritvitej along the way (WIP, preview), or prefer challenging yourself with high-intensity beatmaps in a Zero Distraction environment and get a nice workout while you're at it - Holodance has you covered. The game even lets you catch those orbs with your head - and if you already have Vive trackers, you can catch them with your feet, too, Kung Fu style: What is Holodance? Holo obviously was inspired by Holodeck, so imagine 'dancing in the Holodeck'. Of course, 'dancing' just means tuning into the rhythm and freely moving with the music. There are orbs arriving perfectly in sync with the music that you need to catch, and curves you need to follow. But no, we're not gonna tell you how to move because we consider dancing really a free expressive movement of rhythm and joy. Credits While there are currently only four people working on the game full-time, it is actually an international collaboration with talents from across the globe . For the full credits, check out our Press Kit . Mixed Reality, Vive Trackers, Streamer Mode Holodance has full support for Mixed Reality, using the regular SteamVR quadrant view, MixCast (which requires a subscription but has the nice benefit of doing compositing in-game), and also native LIV integration. Vive Trackers are not required to play Holodance but if you have two and attach them to your feet, you can catch orbs with your feet. Up to 7 Vive Trackers (3 recommended) are support by the Holodance Avatar system which lets you breathe life into various forms, from Animé characters to sci-fi soldiers. The Avatar system ties into Streamer Mode, which is designed to let spectators watch players from various 3rd person perspectives that can even be switched automatically by the game, perfectly on the beat. For Arcades and Parties / Demos We have built-in several features into Holodance to make it work well in demo / party / arcade scenarios. If you enjoy doing demos, or run an arcade, make sure to talk to us.",
