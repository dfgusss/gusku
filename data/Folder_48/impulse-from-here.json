    "About the game": "One explosion and we're on our way! An action game with a new feel The protagonist, AKAHO, has the ability to cause an explosion. By hitting the explosion, she can move at great speed! The game makes full use of these explosions to clear various stages. A variety of stages and three routes you can take to and from Stages vary from dodging enemy barrages, to moving fast incessantly, to carrying boxes in explosions, and more! Furthermore, the game doesn't just clear stages in a straight line, some of the stages have branches inside, allowing you to go between three different routes! You'll find something new every time you play! I'm glad to be dead! A special kind of beaten performance akaho is so poor that the slightest thing other than an explosion will kill her! But there's a little bit of sexiness when she dies, so it's half as gruesome! If you're tired of the game, you can enjoy looking at dead AKAHO!
