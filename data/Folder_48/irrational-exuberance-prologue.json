    "About the game": "Irrational Exuberance is an experiment to probe the possibilities of full room-scale VR and the HTC Vive, unfolding organically as you discover and engage with deep space phenomena. Prologue is the first taste of the galactic fantasy, delivering you to a lonely asteroid in deep space, underneath comets and giant stars. Irrational Exuberance has been an audience favorite at Sundance and the Kaleidoscope tour and praised as a defining VR experience by the media for its use of space, sense and setting. The full release, scheduled for late-2016, will feature dramatic interactions, deeply-immersive moments, and impossible vistas. Featuring: UNCOMPROMISING DESIGN : Exclusively designed for room-scale VR interaction, Irrational Exuberance is a non-violent, organic experience that offers cinematic moments of space, solace and spectacle. AMPLIFIED SENSES : A highly tuned, evocative spatial audioscape takes audiences to the surreal depths of space, from crumbling meteorites to chiming ephemera to the distant hum of stars. HYPER PRESENT REALITY : Beautiful worlds, mysterious sensations, and nuanced interaction weave together to create a heightened sense and awareness of this alternate reality. COMPREHENSIVE PREVIEW : A short, but impactful experience that foretells the events of the full Irrational Exuberance release.",
