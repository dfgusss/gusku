    "About the game": "Step aside winter - spring is coming. Help the forest spirit Kinoko clear the world of winter and bring about spring. Clear away snow, plant flowers, and watch the world return to life as you wander through the woods. So, sit down, relax, and take some time to smell the flowers and listen to the bird song. Kinoko is a short, about 15 min, relaxing third person experience that should be completed in one sitting (the game has no saving system). You will perform a number of tasks in each forest area to be able to unlock the next stone pillar and be able to proceed your journey. You will get familiar with the tasks by the four forest helpers guiding you, on the tutorial island at the start of the game. We recommend that you play the game with a controller (but is playable with keyboard and mouse). Kinoko is a student project created by ThunderLime, and the winning game of Dare Academy 2018.",
