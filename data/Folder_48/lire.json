    "About the game": "LIRE focuses on Eve Antoinette, after her family moved to another country 10 years ago. She came back to visit her favorite childhood spot along with her cat Sebastian. Unfortunately, her cat ran away deep into the forest and disappeared. Eve decided to follow and saw Sebastian jump through the window of an abandoned mansion that she had never known ever existed in this forest. She realized that while the mansion is very mysterious and scary, she still needed to find Sebastian and get out of this place which contains a dark force trapped inside. Eve Antoinette is a quiet girl, as if she had no emotions. She loves flowers, animals, tea, chocolate and reading books. Eve owns a black cat named Sebastian. Do you believe in ghost?
