    "About the game": "manaCompiler is a modular audio/music environment that aspires to establish a ground between traditional digital audio workstations and visual DSP programming languages in extremely accessible way , focusing only in fast and intuitive creative process. Play and mix audio loops , build your own synthesizers or sample-based instruments , combine different sequencer types together like nobody has ever dared to imagine , with incredible ease . Render the output to WAV or route individual audio channels to external mixer or DAW and link multiple manaCompiler instances with network audio . So far 50 different object types provide functionality to create and process multichannel audio and simulate analog control signals across audio/midi interfaces and TCP/IP network . Environment So far 50 object types from simple operators to complete sequencers. Objects can send three types of signal: Audio, Sync and Trigger. Any object can be connected to any other object. Connection types are auto-resolved between object types. Groups of objects can be saved to macros and loaded back between projects. No (software) limit on object amount. State machine for sequencing parameter/data scenes. Complete project saving and loading with all data and parameter states. Interface OpenGL rendered 2.5D interface. Supporting resolutions up to 8K @ 60Hz. Rapid intuitive navigation and operation with or without keyboard shortcuts. (almost) VR ready. Internal manual with thoroughly explained pictures. Customizable color themes as text files. Sound Engine sample rate from 22 KHz to 192 KHz Seamless object operation on runtime. Anti-aliased oscillators. Control signals at audio rate, with ultra precise effect. High quality stereo sample interpolation. Buffered online stereo hard disk recorder. Stereo audio auto-slicing, pitch-analysis and pitch shifting. OPUS-compressed real-time network audio. Control Traditional polyphonic piano roll editor/sequencer. Microtonal support for all synthesis and sample playing. Traditional automation editor/sequencer. Arithmetic and logic objects to process control signals. Algorithmic and stockhastic sequencers. Physics simulation sequencer. Virtual keyboard and sheet note visualizer. I/O Audio through DirectSound, WASAPI or ASIO in Windows 10. Native CoreAudio for macOS. Up to 32 individual input and output audio channels. Reads WAV, AIFF and MP3 audio files. MIDI in/out with support for multiple simultaneous devices. Writes 32-bit WAV files with online render. Reads and writes Scala (.SCL) tuning files. TCP/IP real-time network audio.",
