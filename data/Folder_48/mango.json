    "About the game": "Mango is a surrealist first-person adventure/puzzle game about art and derealization, featuring * trippy, psychedelic visuals * intense psychological and philosophical undertones * fragmented, lore-rich storytelling * experimental horror elements * and last but not least, an overarching feeling of NEVER knowing what to expect . It explores the idea of a mind losing its grasp with reality, as reality turns into a dream, and that dream turns into a nightmare. It has an off-kilter tone that can shift from overly chill to downright scary. Often it resembles an acid trip, or an interactive fever dream. The game contains ~10 hours of gameplay with lots of freaky action, even more freaky fashion, deconstructed urban landscapes and/or dreamscapes, existential angst, questionable parenting, a bit of driving, and a fair load of straight-up madness. It has been described as simultaneously dadaist and hyper-realist in nature, both alien and also deeply human, as well as the story of a life, filtered through the eyes of the mind. Also, it has been described as WEIRD as hell ;) Get into It... Https:/www.facebook.com/mangothegame Https:/www.instagram.com/mangothegame/ ** Photosensitive Warning: Read Before Playing!
