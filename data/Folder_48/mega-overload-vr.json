Stand alone against the robot army or team up with a partner as you blast your way to a high score! Each player wields dual blasters and shoots a variety of mischievous Mega Bots, each with unique attacks, defenses, and flight patterns, in their quest to the top of the leaderboard. Throughout the course of the game, players can choose a safe and steady playstyle or aggressively spend lives to upgrade their weapons for a bot blasting bonanza. Mega Overload also features an online co-op mode, doubling the guns and doubling the fun. Players stand side by side and take out the troublemaking robots together.
