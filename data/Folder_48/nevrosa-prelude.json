A sneak peak into Nevrosa world that brings new gameplay mechanics to VR games: Redirect walking — we don't use teleport or any other locomotion system.

Original puzzles, dark atmosphere and creepy creature and a creepy creature that follows you will help you to prepare for the upcoming full-time escape-horror experience that will finish the story you have started.
