    "Release date": "Jun 12, 2018",
    "About the game": "I was so dazzled that I couldn't open my eyes. The sound of cicadas and the humid air surround me. The faint smell of the sea breeze mixes with the air. I'm sitting on a wooden bench in an old station building. I wonder where I am and what I've been doing here. ...... A nostalgic view of the countryside. A station with 'Natsugiri - Summer Fog' written on it. A single-track railroad. I woke up as if I had been thrown into the light, but I had lost my memory. Strangely enough, I could not find anyone in this strange land. ...... In the Japanese countryside, created with UE4. This is a slightly sad and fantastical first-person Novel ADV/walking simulator where you try to solve the mystery of the invisible people of Natsugiri and 'I'. The game includes Story Mode and Free Mode where you can freely roam around the world of Natsugiri. This is a game by an independent indie game creator, Tatamibeya. The development costs of this game were subsidized by the supporters of the patron-type crowdfunding sites. We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to all of our supporters.",
