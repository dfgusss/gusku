    "About the game": "FOREWORD PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING The game is in Early Access and is constantly being updated. Check out the free demo to see if you are happy with the current state, general flow and vibe of the game. And please note: Project Downfall is not a boomer shooter. Check the demo to see how the action plays and flows or check the games Discord which is full of clips with insane combos and cool encounters sent in by the community. Currently the game is officialy only available in English. Other languages are still being worked and are for preview purposes only. BACKGROUND The world we have known is coming to an end. The European Union is in disarray, with a new superpower emerging on the horizon: The Novorussian Federation, which already welcomed new members such as Lithuania, Ukraine and Poland. Enter the first mega-city of Europe: Crimson Tide. The free city of Crimson Tide(the representative free city of this New World Order, showing that both systems can co-exist in harmony, forging a better future for its citizens) was raised as the representative pinnacle of humanity's achievements on the border of Germany and Poland, in agreement to respect the sovereignty of both the EU/Transatlantic States and Novorussian Federation. But, as history has taught us, this is true only in theory.... Governing parties are not political but rather economical, pointing to a new direction of leading nations. Gone are the days of political parties, replaced by voting with your wallet for the corporate entity which provides everyday life with the highest benefits. Leading corporate entities deal most of the cards, keeping its citizens in check with mandatory medication. Somewhere in the city, in the Lakk District, a regular middle class citizen is about to start another routine day… THE GAME An overdose of reality can have dire consequences... Project Downfall (PDF for short) is a trippy, reflex based shooter with adventure elements. The game is an overall mashup of the the movie „Falling Down” with M.Douglas and the style of „Hardcore Henry” and „John Wick” in a retro (DOOM,Duke3d,Hexen etc) stylised visuals with modern post effects and Dynamic Original SoundTrack. You start in your apartment after another routine day at the office and your adventure starts from there. The storyline will progress with completion of main missions and branch out depending on various factors (chosen path, mental state, specific choice/interaction/pickup/etc) You are a regular, middle class citizen. By day, leading your ordinary, rinse-repeat corpo-routine life, with your lovely girlfriend Olga by your side, a well paid job and crib with an amazing view. What more could a guy want? Yet you feel privileged and as a true socialist you feel you need to give something back… ...By night, you give your contribution to society as a self-proclaimed dealer of justice, dispatching all sorts of scum with extreme prejudice… Or, at least that is what you think... What to expect (Early Access): A fast paced shooter where reflexes and quick thinking count. Levels play more like fast paced puzzles with lethal consequences. Both you and the enemies go down real fast. A dynamic and fitting Original Soundtrack which adapts to what's going on on-screen Non linear progression. Certain scenes will play out differently depending on your choices and state of mind, or maybe even will reveal alternate levels, routes to your goal Cannon fodder Trippy visuals Sanity system. The world will react to the players self-medication threshold in varied ways throughout the games timeline. No health regen Actually no way of replenishing your health at all Lots of alternative events, possibilities, routes and more, leading you to one of the 12 endings. Combo kill and style system The Superkick lots of fun ways of dispatching your foes Leaderboards Freeroam hub which expands with the games timeline offering new opportunities What to expect from v. 1.0 More details and polish Improving and tweaking balance Tweaking, balancing and improving mechanics And generally improving the game as much as can be based on the communities feedback",
