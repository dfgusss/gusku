    "About the game": "Puzzle Noid challenges you in 10 different levels to breaking through the prejudices imposed by society. Differently of other games of its gender, Puzzle Noid develops the player perception making your vision going beyond what it's visible, at the same time it tests your deductive capacity. The gameplay consists in opening the minimum of tilings the faster you can, using your capacity of deduction in pointing blindly the right answers, reaching the best score possible. Besides that, Puzzle Noid has the differential of being almost 100% handmade, bringing unique pieces with an impressive artstyle. The main theme is anthropomorphism (half human, half animals) portraits which are a fixation of the artist @Mabritoilustra. Will you be able to release all the 30 achievements? Is it your mind limited or unlimited? Play it and find out how far you can go!",
