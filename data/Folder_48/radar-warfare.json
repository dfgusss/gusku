I've been making games as a hobby for a while. After 12 mobile games, I decided to take a step further and work on my first PC game. My love for arcade games, retro visuals, and simple mechanics brought to life Radar Warfare. I greatly appreciate feedback and I'm always open to suggestions. Please contact me through twitter, facebook or email me if you'd like to report a bug, something odd, or you just want to say hello. Of course, there's room for improvement: new game modes, new stages, new ships and full controller support are just a few things that I'm going to implement in the future to make this game absolutely great. I really hope you enjoy playing Radar Warfare. Vitor Figueredo - CEO at DreamRoad Productions",
