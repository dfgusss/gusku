    "About the game": "Return to Earth — a dynamic shooter subgenre of 'survival'. The player assumes the role of a soldier who must defend your planet from the attack waves of enemy invaders. The main feature of the game is the high complexity of the passage. The player gets to locations filled with a large number of armed enemies that attack all the time and can kill the player. Each new attack will be stronger than the previous one, and constantly increasing complexity, lack of ammunition and locations without enemies, will keep the player in constant tension. The game has no checkpoints, every death, casts the player in the beginning of the level. Recommendations: Moving locations you can find first aid kits, cartridges and more mosinee weapons. Just don't stand there, to survive you need to keep moving! Keep the weapon on sight, with every second enemies will become more.",
