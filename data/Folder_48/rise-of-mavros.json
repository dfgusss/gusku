    "Name": "Rise of Mavros",
    "Release date": "Jul 23, 2021",
    "About the game": "Gameplay: Knock out all the enemies in a wave and progress through the level. It sounds really easy, but after a while, it might get a little harder. Each level has a specific map and in each level there are waves. After the first wave, the number and the type of enemies might differ. Be careful! Some enemies might perform ranged attacks, where most of them are performing close combat attacks. After you survive a wave, you will get the opportunity to claim a reward. 2 random rewards will appear on the screen. The rewards can be either a skill like time freeze or an upgradable attribute like increased movement speed. It is a good thing to develop a reward-building strategy. You might find out that some skills and attributes work really well with each other, whereas some really don't. To finish a level and proceed on to the next one, you have to defeat the boss. In the final section of each level, there will be a specific boss fight. Meaning each map has its own boss. In order to defeat these legendary bosses, you have to give them all you got, so be strategic... After you complete each wave, you will be rewarded with XP. This will allow you to level up and climb the stages through the 'upcoming global leaderboard'. Also, you will be able to unlock content that you can enjoy playing with (skins, weapons, etc.). Unlock new heroes as you level up and play with the one that fits your taste. All the heroes can use each and every weapon in the game. Some weapons blend better with specific heroes. Discover the best weapon/hero blend according to your playstyle. Throughout the Early Access process, I will be adding new characters to the game, therefore we will have new unlockable heroes. Join the polls in steam to declare your choice of hero to play/see in Rise of Mavros. Also, track down the Road-Map on Steam to see what is going on with the updates. *** We now have quests added to the game. Sometimes a new quest offer will pop up after you survive a wave. If you choose to join a quest, you will be sent back to your progression after you are done with the quest. The Lore: (just for fun) Your masters, the ones who thought you 'the right way' have betrayed you! Turns out that they were the ones who represented the true evil. As a lost child, you were raised by a cult of fighters: The Mavros. You were taught to defend yourself with your bare hands from any kind of attack and learned to control your body like a superhero. All this learning was to use you and your talent to take control of your beloved planet Vanthakaar. The Mavros discovered the ways to possess the fierce power of Vanthakaar's core and this would enable them to take control of the whole galaxy. Now it's time to stop this madness and bring peace and balance to your planet before The Mavros rises...",
