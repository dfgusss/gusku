    "About the game": "A warrior stands alone. A promise is forgotten. Today, that will change ... A mischievous mercenary from wintry Garenia and her long-suffering sister set aside their differences to compete in a tournament of arms. But when an old friend appears in the company of mysterious relic hunters, the past can no longer be denied. Sacred Earth - Promise is a four- to six-hour visual novel/RPG experience set within a fantasy world of floating continents and ancient ruins, with a dynamic custom battle system and a compelling cast of characters. Features: · Three playable characters with their own animated sprites and special attacks. · Multiple difficulty modes to allow casual players and thrill seekers alike to find just the right challenge for them. · Tactical, fast-paced combat: Utilize multiple-hit Chain attacks to build up your EX Gauge and expend it to unleash powerful Burst attacks or heal with EX Recover. · Two ways to explore: Transition between traditional tile maps and the original boardgame-style Symbol Map system for dungeon navigation. Manage your Travel Points to evade traps and gain the initiative in battles, and enjoy party interactions in the field. · 10 side quests, including clever puzzles and challenging optional battles. · 30 full-color CGs and concept art. Available for viewing after game completion. · An engaging presentation with moving portraits that displays conversations between up to four characters at once, with anytime-save and backlog features. · Fully explore the game's world and quests and unlock the true ending.",
