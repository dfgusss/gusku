    "About the game": "Second Chance is a visual novel in original setting. Explore the city and make new friends, solving puzzles and revealing secrets the city hides. Far over the vast blue ocean rises a small, quiet, unremarkable city. One fine evening, Leslie finds himself at the station of this city, completely losing memories of his past. On the platform, the mysterious girl Neny Ryn meets him, informing him that he is an exchange student at a local university. In an effort to find out who he was before, Leslie meets many interesting personalities. Many of them share Leslie’s desire to learn more about himself, and some even become his friends. However, the strangeness that Leslie encounters in the very first days of his stay in the city makes him doubt not only whether they are friends, but even the nature of his own mind. Who are they really? Which of them is lying, and who is telling the truth? And is it true that everyone in our world is entitled to a second chance? FEATURES: UNIQUE VISUAL STYLE: Author's visual style by the unsurpassed artist Eliana-Asato fills the game in all its aspects. Carefully recreated and unique characters with their unique features, highly detailed backgrounds and unique HCG-arts - all of this is done in the same style that allows players to immerse themselves into the game and feel its visual component. HOT HEART: You never know whom the fate will bring you in this strange city. More than a dozen mysterious characters live their measured lives. They don't even suspect that very soon the life of each of them may change under the influence of the hot heart of Lesley. Follow the call of your heart, and you can learn a lot more about each of them and see that part of their soul that was hidden not only from others, but also, and perhaps even from themselves. YOU ARE THE WRITER: Each player’s choice matters, and the story will evolve exactly as the player wants. However, do not forget that every choice can lead to far-reaching consequences. Most of the consequences for the rash choice will face you. And those consequences that remain outside the brackets, sooner or later risk affecting your fate. GAME IN GAME: Several mini-games are designed to dilute the gameplay to get the most complete experience of feelings and sensations of the main character. Hack government security systems and look for ways to access strongly encrypted databases. Defend your honor and fight, standing by an indestructible wall between enemies and those who are dear to you. HALL OF FAME: The gallery system built into the game will not let you forget about your accomplishments. The Art Gallery saves all received CGs, the number of which has already exceeded 115, allowing them to brag, or enjoy at any time, without having to repeat the game. The achievement gallery system allows not only seeing the achieved achievements, the total number of which has already exceeded 40, but also studying them in detail.",
