    "About the game": "Explore the exciting sport of Bass fishing! Based on the Dreamcast hit, motor out to eight different fishing locations to catch the biggest and baddest Bass possible! Choose between fourteen different lures, and compete in four tournaments. Start off as an amateur, and work your way up to the pros in the Masters Classic tournament. Get hooked! Features Hone your fishing skills: Variable weather and water conditions will affect the fishes’ behaviour, so you’ll need to master a wide variety of special lures and angling techniques to catch the one that got away. Are you fishing in the morning? Try a surface lure. Is it hot out? Better drop to cooler water.",
