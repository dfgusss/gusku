    "About the game": "ServerComposer is a compiler / code editing software, or let's say an IDE, that makes it easy for any experienced developer or layman to create their 'WebSocket' or 'Socket' servers in a practical, easy and fast way! The system is compatible with the main programming languages and graphics engines that are most fluent in the market. The only requirement to enjoy the facilities and features that ServerComposer provides is to connect in a websocket or socket ... you can program the functionalities that your server uses using the LUA 5.3.4 programming language, which we edit so that it can operate in the paradigms: Functional and Eventual. The system has a text editor with Text-Hightlight to make your life easier to program, not counting the 'export' tool which makes your multi-platform code (Windows, Linux &amp; Mac) and multi-listener (the same code being for WebSocket and Socket) . #The standalone IDE. #The Exporter.",
