    "About the game": "Slap City is a Seriously Fun platform fighter with a perfect mix of characters from the Ludosity universe. Play Locally or Online . Slap it hard in Ranked or fast and loose in Slap Ball game mode. We are the original inventors of Clutch Technology . Seriously Fun - We have designed Slap City to have the full depth platform fighters fans wish for, while being easily picked up by new players. A perfect mix of characters - Each character offers a completely different innovative playstyle. Play with up to four players locally or online with a variety of game modes, options, and computer controlled opponents, or play for points in online 1 on 1 ranked battles. Save replays of your greatest moments! Want a break from fighting? Try Slap Ball ! (Note: there will be no breaks from fighting.) In this team-based game mode, players slap the ball into the opponent's basket to score. The more the ball gets juggled in the air without touching the ground, the more points it'll be worth, allowing for some serious plays and comebacks. Don't forget to rest near your goal to recover some damage, or each hit from your opponent will soon send you several laps around the court! Clutch Technology - A new innovation in platform fighting games, it's button that Does Things! Try it out. Story Mode - Want to explore the city on your own? No worries! We got you covered with a single-player platforming story campaign for every main character!",
