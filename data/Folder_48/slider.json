    "About the game": "Slider is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide pieces along certain routes to establish a certain end-configuration. It is a descendant of the jigsaw puzzle in that its point is to form a picture on-screen. The last square of the puzzle is then displayed automatically once the other pieces have been lined up. Unlike other tour puzzles, a sliding block puzzle prohibits lifting any piece off the board. Hence, finding moves and the paths opened up by each move within the two-dimensional confines of the board are important parts of solving sliding block puzzles.
