The only person that could ever compel you to come back summoned you with an unexpected phone call. How could you not answer his desperate plea for help? You must go back and save your twin brother from the deadly menace that lurks below the island. The horror begins at land’s end and spreads its wrath over land like a web of suffocating tentacles. A tide of terror has attacked Pilgrim’s Hook. Few townsfolk remain and the ones who do appear to have gone mad. A diabolical power eats away at those who dare to resist the call of the sea.
