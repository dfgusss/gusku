Leaderboard Compete with other players from around the world and reach the #1 spot. Prove once and for all that you are the best Snake player in the world. Classical Endless Mode Fun like in the good old days; just keep going as long as you can. Level Mode Beat puzzle inspired levels by collecting all apples. Don't hit any of the walls. Sounds easy? Well it's not as easy as it sounds! Speed Run Support Beat all levels as fast as possible and see if you can become the fastest player in the world.
