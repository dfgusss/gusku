    "About the game": "Spell Swap is a 2D platformer wizard fighting game where each player gets assigned a single spell which they swap around when hitting each other! Use your spell to kill your opponents, or use it to steal their own! Be careful of enemies surviving your attacks, they will get their revenge on you with your previous spell! Features Play with your friends Spell Swap allows you to play locally with your friends and familly, or play online with Steam Remote Play Together! (There is no solo mode) Let's see who's going to become the best wizard. Or play in teams and cooperate to see what team shall dominate the tournament! Swap between 24 different spells From magical arrows to fireballs, meteor storms or even a nuclear bomb, you have a wide range of spells to master and use against your opponents. Before you start fighting, choose which spells will be available in your tournament. You can fight with only 2-3 spells to ensure a simple and skillfull fight, or enjoy pure chaos and enable the entire pool of spells! Customize the game Create your very own Spell Swap Tournament by tinkering with a lot of customization options! Choose your gamemode, set the objective, play in teams (or not) and add a variety of modifiers to spice things up! Modifiers can reduce spell cooldowns, make the world bouncy, change the art style or even trigger an extremely violent thunderstorm. Up to 4 players with controllers and many more with a keyboard Play with as much players as you want. If you want to try total chaos with an 8+ players game, you absolutely can, we won't stop you! As long as you have enough controllers and keys on your keyboard for everyone to play... The game may support additional controllers when mixing DualShock controllers and Generic / Xbox controllers. It depends on your configuration. A little bit of lore... Since the dawn of time wizards have been gauging their strength by fighting in various tournaments. The winner being the one mastering the most powerful spells. But the Internet was created and the rise of spell tutorials changed everything. How does one determine who is the best wizard when everyone knows the best spells? A few wizards had an idea: create a new type of tournament that doesn’t rely on who knows the best spell, but who masters the most spells, and above all, who adapts best to any combat situation. A tournament where each wizard gets assigned a single spell that they swap when attacking each other. The Spell Swap tournament was born! Join in the fight in this frantic spell-stealing fest and try to become the best Spell Swapper! Learn to master each spell, and choose wisely who you attack in order to become the best Spell Swapper! Don't forget to wishlist ! We now have a Discord server! Come join us on Discord in order to chat with the devs, stay updated on the game and chat about Spell Swap.",
