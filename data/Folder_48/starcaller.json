    "About the game": "The temple that was once pristine has become overgrown and disordered, you return to wade through the newly formed life and complete your life’s work; the ritual to the stars. As the Starcaller you must race against the clock to restore as many temple walls as possible to their former glory. When night finally creeps in, you must complete the final ritual; send as many falling star fragments as possible back to the night sky. Once you've learned each puzzle wall, master them and repeat the ritual as fast as possible to top the leaderboards! Starcaller has 30 unique puzzles, 10 different puzzle walls each with 3 tiers of difficulty and additionally randomized to ensure that every time you play its a new experience! Puzzle tasks range from figuring out celestial patterns, realigning symbols on rotating discs, and memorizing musical notes. We will be updating Starcaller regularly with events, bug fixes, new puzzles, new game modes and more. Smaller updates will be free, larger content packs may come as paid DLC. You can follow our development progress on our Discord and Trello!",
