    "About the game": "SuperBike TT is a single-player, physics-based racing game within a multi-team and multi-bike livery for built-in replayability. SuperBike TT is inspired by classic console racing games as well as the popular Isle of Man TT, considered the most challenging motorcycle race in the world. With these influences in mind, we’re creating an epic, replayable VR SuperBike Time Trial racing game for you to race for the best times on the world’s most difficult tracks. Core Game Features • A unique holographic display for all bike and race stats designed uniquely with the Oculus Rift VR experience in mind. Choose to play with the display on for split times and track info, or off for complete immersion. • Racing control via keyboard or Microsoft 360 Wireless Dual Stick Controller • Robust physics-based gameplay. Every meter of track will be recreated to allow deep development and performance challenges to the player. Learn the tracks, improve your line, and avoid race-ending collisions that throw you from the bike in some of the most spectacular crashes you’ve ever witnessed • Multiple 3D tracks to choose from (may be changed in final release): Millers’ Glen TT Manhattan Beach GP Pacific Criterion TT Dorchester TT Milan InnerCity Raceway Del Mar International Lisbon Street Testing Oval Speedway Echo Park Raceway Highlander TT",
