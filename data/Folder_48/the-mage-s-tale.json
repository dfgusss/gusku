    "About the game": "The corrupt wizard Gaufroi has kidnapped your master, Mage Alguin, and only you have any hope of saving him. You may be an apprentice now, but to save your master, you will need to explore ten deadly dungeons, decipher mind-bending puzzles, avoid terrifying traps, and vanquish hordes of vicious monsters. Until you are able to wield every elemental power in the palm of your hand, evil remains ascendant! It is your turn now to sling gouts of flame, javelins of ice, arcs of lightning, and swirling tempests! Don your wizard’s robe and begin your Mage’s Tale! Collect mystic ingredients, which you can use to craft hundreds of custom spells in your very own Mage's Workshop. Explore the ancient crypts, sewers, and dungeons to discover devious traps and secret rooms hidden around every corner. Experience a story that takes place in the same world as The Bard’s Tale series and soon before the events of The Bard’s Tale IV: Barrows Deep! The Mage's Tale is an adventure designed from the ground up to capture the magic of the VR gaming experience.",
