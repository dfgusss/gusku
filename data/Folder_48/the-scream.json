    "About the game": "The most famous painting in the world releases its demons The Scream by Edvard Munch is omnipresent. Its terror-twisted face has made such a deep and lasting impression on the collective imagination that it is even used for an emoji representing anxiety. But do you really know this iconic painting? Munch’s demons and ghosts emerge from the canvas to plunge you into the painter’s sources of inspiration, revealing quite a few precious secrets. The privilege of going head-to-head with the famous masterpiece provides a spectacular immersion into the painter’s tortured psyche, bringing you up close and anxiously personal with natural and supernatural phenomena, ghosts and mummies. The canvas suddenly releases its demons and chaos invades every millimetre of your personal (virtual) space. This breath-taking dive into Munch’s The Scream will not leave you unscathed. - Immerse yourself into the world around this art piece and interact with it the elements around you - Available on HTC Vive and Oculus Rift - 6DoF Tracking, compatible with Leap Motion A documentary experience by Sandra Paugam &amp; Charles Ayats With the voices of Paul Hamy &amp; Ann Christine Sound Design &amp; Music: Franck Weber Concept Artist: DeeMoes Development: BackLight Sound integration: TAPE Coproduction: Cinétévé Expérience &amp; ARTE France, in partnership with BackLight With the support of the Centre National du Cinéma et de l'image animée and the help from the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur",
