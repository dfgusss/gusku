    "About the game": "I'm sure you had played Tetris, but this game, will give you new experience. Unlimited position In this game, the movement of graphics is not limited by the unit lattice. Graphics can be moved to arbitrary coordinates rather than integer units. The rotation of the graphic can also be an arbitrary angle . Deadly cutting When the graphic meets the following conditions, the graphic is cut into multiple pieces. The countdown on the graph is zero. When the filling of a graphic in a layer meets the requirements. this means that as the game progresses, once you have an oblique graphic, there will be a lot of irregular objects in the game (whether this is a blessing or a curse ；）) Difficulty rating For single-player mode, I offer three different types of difficulty. simple when the layer fill reaches 75% can score elimination. normal when the layer fill reaches 85% can score elimination. difficulty when the layer fill reaches 90%, the score is eliminated. at the moment I test that the simple pattern seems too simple, and the subsequent difficulty will be adjusted according to the feedback. scoring rules Unlike the traditional score, I designed a new set of scoring rules. A row of padding *1000 gets the score of the conversion elimination. Continuous elimination of two lines will be two lines of the total score of *2. continuous elimination of three rows will be three lines of total *3 and so on. Development plan If the current version feedback is good, then I will continue to complete the game's two or two modes. Cooperation mode '2019.4.14 Update' the model has now been developed: one person manipulates the falling graphic, and the other player controls a small square that can move freely to assist another player in the game. If the block touches a red area or is destroyed, it will be punished.[/i] Battle mode Two people have different areas and can harass your opponent by consuming points to use props . Both modes have online and local split screens to choose from If you have some good advise or anything other you can send email to me (please use “TimeFall” as title)",
