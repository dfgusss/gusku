    "About the game": "TOY-WAR a Fantasy first person shooter game! Wonderful Graphic by The best Engine of the World, The Unreal Engine 4 Features Wonderful Graphic Fantasy war Magical World Basic FPS Game Easy To play Unreal Engine 4 Graphic Interesting Story Storyline TOY-WAR is war weapon and military equipment there is microform weapon for actual use. All types are manufactured using nanotechnology. While the cargo ship is going to Sydney Australia the TOY-WAR containers is lightweight and it must be place on the top of the vessel, there is a big storm surge during the way and hit the TOY-WAR containers into the sea. The ship must quickly escape this storm. The TOY-WAR container cannot be recovered but that's okay with marine insurance and the most of the goods in the ship is agriculture must be delivering on time to protect the goods. Later, orangutan found the TOY-WAR containers first and opened it but not found anything they can eat. So them leave and go away. Later on the brown ants &amp; white ants found TOY-WAR which is fit for use. They took TOY-WAR used as a war weapon. This is the Beginning of TOY-WAR. After the TOY-WAR containers full of goods was blew by the storm deep into the sea, German’s, Japan’s and Italy’s Miniature Weapon Containers were marooned to the beach which is in the ant territory of “Germun” while Amercan’s, England’s and France’s Miniature Weapon Containers were marooned to the beach which is in the ant territory of “Amerikan”. Russia’s Miniature Weapon Container was marooned to the ant territory of “Russer”. Later, the Amerikan’s ants establish a naval base and airport at Pohobo. There must be a purchase order of the minimum quantity of 10 unit of each ship before they are being produced. Therefore, there are 10 miniature Arizona ships stationed and more than 400 miniature airplanes are as well stationed at the airport. Thus, “Germun” ants plan to attack Pohobo. Admiral “Germun,” said. Minimum of 10 units of “Kega” Plane Carrier were produced upon a TOY-WAR purchase order. We found 6 “Kega” Plane Carriers in TOY-WAR container, but could not found the rest 4. It is alright because 6 plan carriers are sufficient enough to attack Pohobo. The fortuneteller predicted that the 7 of December is a good day suitable for attacking Pohobo and we will win. Before the planes will attack Pohobo, the fortuneteller suggests using the attack code as “NEKO-NEKO-NEKO” 3 times which means Cat-Cat-Cat. He confirms that we will win certainly. We do not have shallow-water torpedo, but we will attach the foam with the torpedo so that it can be used in shallow water. After attack Pohobo, the “Amerikan” ant navy army’s efficiency will be reduced. Therefore, it will be a good opportunity for us “Germun” ant army to take possession of all species of ant territory both the lands and islands to be consolidated as “Germun” ant territory.",
