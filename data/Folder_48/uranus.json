    "About the game": "Uranus is a short visual novel for adults only. It's a story about the people in a small, mysterious town. They like to party, get drunk and get laid. There's a lot of downtime for them and gossiping is a sport. They think they can talk privately but are about to discover erotic interruptions. Follow along with them and discuss your own interests. Hear the rumors. Experience their sexy stories along the way! Latest version adds an interactive dialogue sequence. Each page in the story contains a CG (high quality render). There are over 110 unique CGs used (sometimes repeated) throughout the story. An occasional clicker mini game challenges the player before unlocking the next scene. There are no branches and only one ending to the story, but there's a few opinion based choices similar to those found in a dating sim. All choices are used to determine one of six (single page) bonus endings to the story. Replay the game and try to unlock all of the endings!",
