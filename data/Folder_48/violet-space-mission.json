    "About the game": "Space stations have mysteriously gone offline. Decades worth of data are still uncollected. That’s where you come in, Candidate Alpha. We need you to collect the caches of information adrift in space. A number of collection sites have been located, but there are too many unknown astrophysical factors. We cannot guarantee your safety. Violet: Space Mission is a 2D precision action game in space, about dodging asteroids, data collection and space exploration. You are Candidate Alpha, sent on the Violet Programme for this mission. Good luck and godspeed. Dodge asteroids. Zero gravity in 2D. Hand drawn art and animations. Precision gameplay. Every move you make matters. Easy to pick up, difficult to master. Intense gameplay across 12 unique levels. Killer Lobster has begun development of a story-driven, sci-fi puzzle adventure game, based on the expanded universe of the VIOLET series, with returning gameplay elements of VIOLET: Space Mission. Please look forward to our next release! Useful Links: Official Website Presskit Violet Manual Violet : Space Mission on Android",
