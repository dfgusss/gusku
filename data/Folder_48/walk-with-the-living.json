FEATURES -Experience a surreal, aching story. -Enjoy beautiful sprite art and character illustrations. -Consider space and terrain in creative ways to keep your party alive through tactical battles with an array of objectives. -Meet complex characters and form relationships (both platonic and romantic) between them to gain significant in-battle benefits. -Make choices that drastically impact the course of the narrative and the relationships between various characters. There are no right or wrong choices; all choices have consequences, both positive and negative. -Replay and make different choices to discover dozens of secret endings and character epilogues. Weapons, items, and gold carry over with new game plus. Walk many paths throughout your lifetimes. -Characters die permanently, but there are always more stories to be told; when a character dies, new narrative branches, relationships, and recruitments become available. Death isn’t the end. (If you'd rather, there's a non-permadeath mode too! In this mode, characters only die during story sequences.) -There's a cat! CHARACTERS Rowan Raised from the dead against his will to bring vengeance against his former employer, he struggles to cope with existing among the living in a body that feels dead. Aoife An unwilling leader of a growing movement to exact justice on the mercenary company raiding villages of the countryside, she harbors doubts about whether her mission to avenge her sister has meaning in the wake of her sister’s death. Keir After achieving what seemed impossible by raising Rowan from the dead, he accompanies Aoife on her quest of vengeance while holding onto regrets about his late lover, Niall.",
