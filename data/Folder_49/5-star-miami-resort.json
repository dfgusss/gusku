    "About the game": "In the Champions League of hotel management Lucy has to tackle her next mega project: creating a ground-breaking hotel resort in Miami. And you are her helpful assistant! Which means you're automatically involved in all aspects of the project. Soon you'll realize that things are quite different in Magic City: now you have to overcome obstacles on linked boards. In some cases you need torches to actually see obstacles. Buildings influence your gameplay, too. As soon as the first guests arrive at your hotel you have to keep their satisfaction level as high as possible. Are you going to turn your Miami Resort into yet another success story? Clever hotel construction: Create a mega hotel resort with 25 buildings which impact your gameplay Extended boards: Now you can play on linked boards extending over several screens It's all about the right strategy: Choose from exciting Match 3 gameplay with a limited number of turns or a more casual experience on Relax mode. New gameplay experience: Use torches to spot hidden obstacles, and beware of reinforced wooden crates Engage in in-game dialogues: Try out several hilarious multiple choice answers (which won't change the story) Entertaining challenges: Creative challenges and achievements will make sure you will need to use all your talents We were Inspired By: Gems of War Runefall 10,000,000 Zuma You Must Build A Boat Tumblestone Bejeweled",
