    "About the game": "This is a 'war' about cats, or just an ordinary game. Players only need to shake a drink bottle, press and hold the left mouse button to accumulate power and throw it to other cats. You can make the opponent fall into an abnormal state. You can get the enemy's props by 'touching and killing out' the enemy with the last blow. At the same time, you can also collect dried fish, gold coins and other props from the map. Exchange what you need with the cats in the town. Increase your combat effectiveness until you save your 'excrement shoveling officer'“",
