    "About the game": "Humanity is no more. From the deepest corners of space, the Astrozombies took the Earth by storm. Their advanced technology and ruthless ways lead to a swift and certain death. Yet, as silent as they arrived, they disappeared back into the distant stars. You play as the lone survivor who, hidden aboard one of their spaceships, crashes into their planet with a score to settle. Nowhere to return and no one to save, revenge is all that remains… There is only one thing on the Astronaut's mind: ASTROZOMBIES MUST BE DESTROYED ! With no fancy stuff like multiple jumps or power-ups (leave those to the secret unlockable characters ;) ), it’s up to your own prowess to get through the deadly stages and rid the universe of this evil. Armed only with your trusty blaster and your courage, a lonely gravestone awaits in the distance. Beware… Astrozombies ! Features: A unique, carefully crafted 2D art style. Raw arcade gameplay that goes right into the action. Test your skills through unique and challenging stages. Encounter over 30 different kinds of enemies. Bring down some tough-as-nails bosses. 2 secret characters, each with its own playstyle. Uncover the lore by filling the Zombiepedia. A bunch of achievements for bragging rights. Original soundtrack developed by musician Lucas Córdoba.",
