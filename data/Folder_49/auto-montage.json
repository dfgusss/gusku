    "About the game": "Automatically cutting the high light scene(kill eliminated defart splated) and create a video clip from your Playing Video Game Movie File(mp4). When you create a montage of game highlight scenes, you will be looking for the highlight scenes and making cut edits to the video. This software automatically edits the cut. This app automatically finds highlight scenes from gameplay videos with huge playback time and spits them out to mp4 files. Consider editing a 10 hour video. I think that just looking for the highlight scene will consume one day. With this software, you can let the application do other things by letting the application edit the cuts of the highlight scenes. The app has already finished the cut edits while you are dating, eating rice, and eating potato chips. Supported Games ・Splatoon2 ・Apex Legends ・VALORANT Games that will be supported in the future are as follows ・Fortnite ・Splatoon3 It may use NVENC technology from NVIDIA graphics cards. It can be used without this, but it can only support the baseline profile and main profile in mp4. (only limited encoding is possible in terms of license, not technically). The trial version has a watermark.",
