    "About the game": "Batterneers is an exciting, action-packed game for up to 4 players. Fight across a number of different maps and game modes using a range of abilities and powerups. Do note that as of now, Batterneers only supports online and LAN multiplayer. Local multiplayer is currently not available. Battle Across a Range of Different Game Modes Deathmatch - Fight to be the last one standing with the highest score in this classic game mode. Gem Chase - Hold onto the precious gem for as long as you can while avoiding your fellow players. Treasure Hunt - Collect the most treasure to win the game! But watch out, as other players can try to sabotage you. Choose Your Approach to Combat Cannons - In order to be the best, you'll need to learn how to fire your cannons, calculate the trajectory and use a range of unique powerups to your advantage. These include tracking balls, boomerangs, summoning the kraken, sun beams, explosives and more! Bombs - The most dangerous weapon in Batterneers. Bombs can be picked up and thrown at pursuing enemies, but watch out as just one rogue cannon ball can make everything go wrong. Ship - Using the right powerups, your ship can be as deadly as any weapon in the game. Spikes, ocean swirls and rapid reloading will make anyone run away in fear.",
