Load up your guns, grab your unicorn horns, and fortify your sandbags as your childhood nostalgia is back on PC! EASY TO PLAY: Move the mouse to aim and left click to fire. SILLY CUTSCENES: Enjoy the original cutscenes and relive the old wacky story of Oliver and the Mystical Treasures. BIZARRE BOSSES: Your old foes are back and as odd as ever! They're big, they're bad, and some of them have quite a nice acapella voice!",
