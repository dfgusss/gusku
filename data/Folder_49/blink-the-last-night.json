    "About the game": "How scary could a night of babysitting be? Synopsis: In BLINK, you assume the role of a babysitter watching over Lily Vida, daughter of a local psychiatrist. A regular night of babysitting takes a sinister turn when someone or something attempts to kidnap Lily. It's up to you to try and get her back in this psychological horror story that will keep you guessing as to what's really happening. Game features: • The blink effect - The player is constantly blinking randomly and we use this to initiate a variety of events. These include jumpscares, teleports, camera effects, environment changing, and more. • Psychological Horror – The blink effect isn't the only source of horror. Players will also experience character-driven psychological horror that reveals more of the plot while also keeping the player uncomfortable. • Detailed Environment Exploration - Every location in the game is teeming with detail about the characters and setting. Explore the detailed home to uncover more about the Vida family. This game is a short, 30 to 45 minute long initial chapter of a four-part psychological horror story.",
