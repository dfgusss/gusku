    "About the game": "A boxing pad trainer where you hit coloured targets in sync with the beats of your mp3. You'll also have to dodge and parry strikes as you top the ranks of the ninja shrine. Striking angles are strict and the game promotes hip movement for intense workouts. The dark setting combines elements of rave and martial arts in a colourful experience. All the beats are mapped in real-time by our algorithm, including the default music. TIP: Create a folder 'My Music/Yolopia' to limit the mp3 search inside that folder only. The game is also available on AppLab for the standalone quests. You can find it here",
