    "About the game": "BOX is a logic puzzle-platformer game where you must navigate small mazes and symmetrical obstacles to collect every 'dot' placed within. Each level is a Box that can be rotated 90 degrees in either direction. Rotate the stage to change the layout of the level, as well as your own position within it. Objects behave differently depending on their color: black platforms move with the stage's rotation, while purple ones do not. Red 'dots' cannot be collected until certain conditions have been met. Experiment, and discover what is possible. This game is not very long. On average, it can be completed within 2-3 hours. A perfect game for when you want to be somewhere else for a while. It will get difficult, but do not stress. You will figure it out, I am sure. Don't worry if you can't get it right away- it will always be here when you're ready, like an old tape collecting dust on a wooden shelf, an old memory waiting to be remembered. A chromatic world of sight and sound. And boxes.",
