    "About the game": "Re-live this classic medieval strategy game, Castles &amp; Catapults, which combines the turn-based planning of a board game with the action and excitement of a real-time strategy game. Players must construct and defend their own castles while amassing an army to attack their opponent with. Each 'day' in the game is divided into three phases, with players taking turns spending money on their castle or their army in the first, amassing their forces in the second phase, and then going into the final, real-time combat phase. Castles &amp; Catapults is packed with the best in medieval warfare--building castles, storming walls, demolishing armies, and, of course, battling dragons. NOTE: Multiplayer functionality is no longer supported",
