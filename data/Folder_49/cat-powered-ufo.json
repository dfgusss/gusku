    "About the game": "Cat Powered UFO is a comedy RPG inspired by the old-school Super Nintendo game Earthbound. The design philosophy was to combine the best parts out of old school games like Zelda-style puzzles and overworld battles, as well as turn-based combat, and leave out the grinding and other boring bits! Much like Mario Odyssey, Cat Powered UFO allows you to move on to new areas and challenges without finishing absolutely everything possible in your current area. Battles revolve around minigames, which are unique to each enemy. Combat is easy to learn, but offers surprising depth to players who wish to find synergies of 'Illegal bonuses'. You can combine these 'Illegal bonuses' to break the combat system! And essentially customize your battle experience to your liking. There is even a 'HARDCORE MODE' for the player who likes their games to kick them in the scrotum. The whole game is designed to be a short and sweet experience, taking players somewhere between 3-5 hours to reach the standard ending. However, there is also a 'True ending' for those that want to go above and beyond! I recommend using an Xbox controller for the best experience. However, a keyboard also works perfectly well. If you are looking for a whacky and light-hearted experience to fill your day, I humbly suggest you give Cat Powered UFO a try! And with that, I leave you with a poem. A poem, for you! My potential player! Be yourself! As you always are! My next request, is a bit out far! You're an alien! AN ALIEN? You even have an Alien Wife! Livin' that sweet Alien Life! What more could you want? Ok, let's say shes pregnant! But no good thing can last for long! THE SPACE DEVIL has come along! He kidnaps your wife! Causing you strife! And so your adventure begins... Your means of travel, powered by cats! You look around, and how about that! There isn't a cat to be seen or heard! The solution, you know to be absurd... To venture into a world you hate! Full of mischief, I'll tell you mate! This place is crazy! Lost their minds! No doubt you'll do the same in kind! Strap yourself in! Let us begin! Embrace the madness thats within! You'll laugh, you'll cry. You'll probably die! And yeet your keyboard to the sky! But won't regret a dollar spent! Cat Powered UFO! Worth every cent!",
