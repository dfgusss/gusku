    "About the game": "Just you. On a lake. Step into your rowboat, grab the paddles and dive into a meditative, relaxing VR fishing experience like no other. Catch &amp; Release places you on a beautiful mountain lake and lets you freely explore and row around while you choose your fishing spot and take in the scenery. The backdrop for your fishing adventures includes dense forest, mountains, cliffs and reed covered coastlines. While you fish you can listen to music on the radio, skip stones across the lake or use any other of the many interactive items. Choose the right bait, pick a good fishing ground and cast your rod to get the biggest fish on the hook! But once you do, it’s not over yet. You’ll have to tire out your catch and win the fight before you can reel it in! The game is designed to enable players to unwind and play however they want, or you can take on missions to unlock new gear and interactive items to help you catch the biggest fish! Catch &amp; Release has been built from the ground up for VR and tracked controllers. We have also compiled several radio channels with their own music genres for your listening pleasure on the lake. Catch &amp; Release works on Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Microsoft Mixed Reality.",
