The one, the only... The RPG about a corpo - nightmare! Have you ever worked in a corporation, feeling that nobody understands your pain and the amount of absurdity that you must deal with? Or maybe you are aware how demotivated can an employee get after few years of constantly doing things that make no sense? In that case you already know what our game is about! We managed to describe these feelings and create an RPG based on this environment, because as they say: 'Life writes the best stories'. You play as Martin, a Senior Test Engineer, working in a Test Department and it is Monday, yes... the dreadful Monday. From the beginning of the game you embark on an epic quest to make sure that things actually start working. But will the corporation actually help you, or will it make sure that your quest won't be a walk in the park? By this time you should already know the answer...
