Using the power of common sense and cleaning products, defend your personal space from the oncoming virus hoard. Can you go the social distance? Fight the boredom and help a good cause. 25% of all developer proceeds will be donated to various COVID relief efforts. We will be keeping our community involved by announcing each donation's chosen recipient and will adapt with the continuing situation to allocate funds to the people affected most by this devastating pandemic. Familiar tower defense gameplay. Collect and spend the elusive and rare TP rolls. 4 different game modes and 8 maps to defend. Each map has an infinite mode with leaderboards. Twitch integration, viewers can play along in the chat. Doesn't require leaving your home. COVID Kawaii! will continue to grow in content! Up next will be Episode 3; Featuring another new environment, new defenders, new cowonas, and ALL this new content will be FREE for existing players.",
