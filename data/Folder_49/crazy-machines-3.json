Place missing pieces into zany chain reactions and turn them into ingeniously working machines to solve puzzles like these: How do you successfully punch an Egyptian statue in the face? How do you shoot a kettle from the head of a clumsycorn with a 'high precision crossbow'? How do you jumpstart the grey-matter-engine of that old junker of a space taxi? Find out in Crazy Machines 3! Prepare yourself for the ultimate playground of vast Rube Goldberg style possibilities! Use physical systems to your advantage, no matter if it’s electricity, explosions, lasers, lightning, or wind.
