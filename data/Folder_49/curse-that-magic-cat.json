    "About the game": "Curse That Magic Cat! is a lighthearted, single-player game in which you have been cursed and turned into a cat. Explore the mansion of Magnus the Wizard, collecting three spell books in each level in order to escape. Along the way, take your revenge by breaking the wizard's belongings, stealing and using his potions, and ducking under furniture to watch Magnus search for you in vain! Key Features: Magnus the Wizard, an AI opponent (whom you hate) to challenge you. Six levels in which to unleash your inner sneaky, destructive cat. Collectible cat colors to ensure you look purr-fect while taking your revenge. And yes, breakable things for your cat to push off tables and shelves. Notes: Curse That Magic Cat! is published by SMU Guildhall and developed by a small student capstone team over a development cycle of 14 weeks. Additional development on the game is not currently planned beyond its academic completion.",
