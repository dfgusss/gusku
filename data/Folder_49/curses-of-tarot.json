'The night was dreary, and I had traveled far. Suddenly, through a gap in the trees I saw the warm glow of a campfire beside a covered wagon. Perched on the stoop, an old woman beckoned me inside, promising a chance to rest, and perhaps a glimpse of my future. Little did I know what she had in store...' 'You face a crossroads, traveler. Let us see just how fate judges thee!' Game Modes: Standard - the full game experience, including boons, curses and special events. Endurance - how long can you last as your deck grows ever larger? Timed - set a new high score in a casual, 10-minute game, perfect for coffee breaks. Other Features: Save your progress and resume a run at any time. Gorgeous, procedurally generated card art. Leaderboards for every game mode. Steam achievements. Colorfully detailed game board and event art. Endless replay value. Full widescreen and ultra-widescreen support.",
