    "About the game": "Please check out our controller guide before playing You awake to find yourself in a gloomy, decrepit research facility. Screams can be heard in the distance, something unnatural drips nearby and an unsettling feeling sinks into your gut. You are alone, stuck in a wheelchair and with no way to defend yourself. What happened to this place? Why can’t you remember who you are or why you find yourself here? What happens next? That’s up for you to find out in Deadness. Deadness is a VR Horror Game that places you in a wheelchair and expects you to survive. Experience our new take on VR locomotion while avoiding the undead horrors that roam these places. Guide yourself over rickety planks, make your way past swinging corpses, past hallways of screaming limbs and struggle through inhospitable environments not suited for you. This game will require you to keep your wits about you, find ways to avoid line of sight or distract enemies. Explore the environments and listen to audiotapes about what has happened here. Our intention with Deadness was to create a realistic virtual experience with intuitive controls and a dread-inducing atmosphere. To create a feeling of helplessness in the face of overwhelming horror both real and imagined. Do you have what it takes to survive these nightmares? Features: ● Explore a decrepit horror filled research facility to discover what happened and who you are. ● Survive by out-witting the creatures that lurk the dark rooms and corridors. Stay out of sight or distract them in any way that you can. ● Feel helpless with immersive and realistic movement controls where both hands are required to move the wheelchair bound protagonist. You cannot shoot and move at the same time. ● Find audio tapes scattered throughout the facility to uncover the dark secrets behind the nightmare.",
