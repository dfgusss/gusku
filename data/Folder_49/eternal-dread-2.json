    "About the game": "Eternal Dread 2 is an Action-RPG game set in the bleak world ravaged by years of oppression under the demons, where men were all but decimated in the never-ending struggle. All that is left are the younglings and the elderly incapable of taking up arms, leaving the girls in their prime to step up and protect the remnants of human race. Though the four vile Elder Fiends were vanquished, the threat persists still in great numbers. To bring the world an everlasting triumph, the surviving humans rose up to hunt down the demoralized demons. And while they were making progress, little they knew that a new tide of darkness is looming. One that will plunge the world into another terrifying eon of torment… FEATURES 6 Playable Characters – All with unique skills and gameplay for you to master. Choose from the selections of Warrior - Possessing both attack and defense prowess, Warrior is peerless in close combat and archery alike.

Battle Mage – Proficient in melee and magic, Battle Mage can dispatch any foes regardless of their physical or magical resistance. Engineer – Despite her shortcoming in physical, she makes up with the intellect to construct turrets, golems as well as myriad of gadgets.
