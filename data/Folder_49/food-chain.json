    "About the game": "You have to control the animal in an uncompromising struggle for survival. Each has its own individual characteristics: mass, speed, manoeuvrability, damage, skin thickness, absorb and dry. The battle takes place on land, in water and in the air. Water is a major resource that activates regeneration and prevents death from thirst. You can distance yourself, but the drought begins and players are forced to go to a risky rapprochement in the fight for the last water. How not to became Food You need water, just put your head in it. Water goes out, it's inevitable. Use claws, jaws, hooves, horns and beaks in the fight for last water. Early Access Features The game is based on a sensitive sync of complex skeletons. Each part of the body, when collide with an obstacle, affects the movement according to its proximity to the center of gravity. Sound appears through physical interactions. It feels authentic, and I think more surfaces will be added. Animals not invented, only used. Fourteen species are available: bear, boar, crocodile, crow, deer, eagle, elephant, fox, goat, owl, hippopotamus, lion, rhinoceros, wolf. Their numbers are limited to common sense. This does not mean that new animals will be actively added, but in the future, it will probably be part of a season cycle. I look at the simulation as a potential single player mode in which you could create battles, by controlling behaviors. After obtaining sufficient data, detailed statistics for each species, player ratings, statistics, graphs, etc., will be available.",
