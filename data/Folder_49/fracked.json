    "About the game": "The award-winning action adventure, now on PC VR! From the creators of the ground-breaking Phantom: Covert Ops, Fracked seamlessly collides relentless “run and cover” gunfights with free and fluid skiing and climbing, in trailblazing fashion. Uncompromised, audacious, and unashamedly stylish, Fracked grabs your VR headset by the motion controllers and delivers an ass kicking game that has been made from the ground up for virtual reality platforms. Playable on Valve Index, HTC Vive, Meta Rift S, and Meta Quest and Quest 2 via Oculus Link. BE THE ACTION HERO Grab your gun, cock it, and take aim as a maverick war hero thrown back into the fight. Experience innovative VR gunplay that ingeniously blends improvised run and gun combat with a 1:1 grabbable cover system. Move freely around the battlefield to outflank, outsmart, and outgun an escalating threat with your arsenal of deadly, fully interactive weapons. FEEL THE ADVENTURE Venture through a harsh and dangerous mountain locale by seamlessly transitioning between a host of first-person free movement methods. Physically lean into the bends on your skis to master the slopes at high speed. Reach out and hold on for your life as you climb and zipline far above the ground or perform audacious base-jumps to elude your foes. No rails. No limits. No mercy. SAVE THE PLANET The corporation dug too deep unleashing the ‘Fracked’ from the depths below. Across one day, take on an interdimensional army that combines hive mind mentality and gun-wielding supremacy - the perfect targets to unload round upon round into. Fracked is in-your-face action with a cutting commentary on corporate greed and the climate change emergency. Save the day, to save the world. DESIGNED FOR VIRTUAL REALITY Created from the ground up for VR devices, Fracked pulls the action-adventure genre to revolutionary new heights through intuitive 1:1 VR gameplay. Interactions, locomotion and gunfights seamlessly combine in a single, pioneering VR game.",
