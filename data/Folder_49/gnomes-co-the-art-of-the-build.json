    "About the game": "Gnomes &amp; Co is an optimization-based puzzle game from Cheers Games. Somewhere out in the forest live the gnomes - tiny people who make their living building products for the big folk. As their new director, your job is to figure out the most efficient way for them to build each product. This includes using multiple gnomes, designing your own scaffolding, making multiple products in a batch... the only limit is your cunning. Although each gnome's move set is simple, every puzzle has a vast array of possible solutions. Compete with other players online to come up with the best designs.",
