    "About the game": "Gods of Sand is a gladiator manager with turn based combat, heavily inspired by the Swords and Sandals series, but in a darker and unforgiving setting. Besides fighting in multiple arenas, micromanaging your ludus and gladiators is an important part of the game, which features: To run a ludus (a gladiator school) you must always pay attention to the economics of your business. Fight to get money and prizes, train your gladiators enough to maintain a solid income and restore the old and abandoned ludus your family left you. Multiple items and weapons are allowed inside combat, but knowing the best time to use your gear is key if you want to be the champion of the arenas. Any skill, armor or weapon is usable by any gladiator, generating lots of possibilities when it comes to creating new builds.",
