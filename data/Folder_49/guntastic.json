    "About the game": "Guntastic is a couch and online party brawler where up to four players battle in lightning-fast, one-shot one-kill rounds that last only 25 seconds – after which anyone who's still alive is forcibly eliminated. Explode your friends in this frantic homage to the 16bit coin-op games of the past! Features Fast-paced, One-shot One-kill Combat. Choose from a vast arsenal of weapons and powerups to wreak havoc on your foes. Easy to learn, hard to master gameplay. Although the basics are easy to pickup, Guntastic offers rich gameplay possibilities so that two matches never play the same. One screen, 4-players online/local multiplayer. Challenge up to three friends in local couch games or compete against people from around the world in online multiplayer matches. Retro and over-the-top visuals and soundtrack. Everything in the game is reminiscent of the 16-bit era, and was born out of our love for the videogame and movie classics of the past. Hand crafted, dynamic levels. Use the environment to your advantage: most levels feature dynamic elements that create spectacular ways to frag opponents!",
