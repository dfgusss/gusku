    "About the game": "Arha lives a simple life as a shrine maiden at a long-forgotten temple finding joy in her worship, tending her small garden and occasional trips to the nearby village. Then, one day, the sun does not rise… It soon becomes apparent, though, that the now-erratic sun is the least of their problems. The wells and rivers are drying up and crops wither in the fields. The villagers demand answers, but the gods, as ever, are silent. After a night of desperate prayer, Arha awakes – and she is not alone. Three young men have appeared in the temple, finely dressed and impossibly beautiful, and, what is more, they claim to be gods. Powerless and confused, the four decide to travel to the First Temple to try to restore the balance of Heaven before it is too late. Accompany three fallen deities on a journey across a dying world, where hope is all man has left. __________________________________________________________________ Visual novel features: - Choice of main character name - 191,000 words - 40+ atmospheric backgrounds - 30+ CGs - 3 romance options - 7 possible endings ***Please note: this game is set in an apocalypse scenario and thereby contains scenes of non-graphic, infrequent violence and the aftermath of natural disasters.
