    "About the game": "Adventures of forsenE: The Hobo Knight is a platform style game where the title and content were decided by you, the bajs. The star is Forsen, a dishevelled hobo streamer whose girlfriend and snus are unexpectedly stolen by a ‘transparent figure’. To reclaim his love and addiction, he must fight through seven levels of warrias, beating long forgotten bosses and making friends along the way. Expect well-known faces in his adventures, such as Pajlada, as you traverse your way to Spain to confront the final boss. This game realies the boundary between entertaining lidl games and polished AAA games. Each level is estimated to be 1 hour long, creating at least 7 hours of grabbing gameplay. The creators include: InfiniteGachi, the developer and streamer, Tom Streets, a talented graphic designer, and Fatherpucci1, the sound designer and renowned performance artist. This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, businesses, places, events, locales, and incidents are either the products of the author’s imagination or used in a fictitious manner. Any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, or actual events is purely coincident",
