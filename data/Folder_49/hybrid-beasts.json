    "About the game": "Hybrid Beasts is a unique cross-genre game where you explore, conquer and defend an open world full of adventures, quests and secrets. Up to 6 players battle with teams of never before seen creatures in an explosive yet strategic couch-multiplayer fun ! Gameplay Overview A large and open world that can be explored freely . Starting in the lush forest, you can travel in any direction be it towards frozen glaziers, arid deserts or volcanic landscapes. Many mystic places, however, at first are locked or hidden. Complex storylines can be followed and quests can be solved to unveil all the secrets and lore of the land. For each newly explored level, the beasts battle to decide who will be the first conquerer of this uncharted land. The victorious new ruler must then fortify and defend his reign. Beasts can even seize prestigious titles as “King of the Forest” that will prove helpful given the tale of an ancient legend which states: “...only a true king can reassemble the Arcane Rainbow Crystal”.

For example, in a forest, you can dive into the clear water; whereas, in colder regions, the water is frozen to a solid block of ice that can be walked on.
