    "About the game": "'It's Spring Again' - an educational game for children ages two and up. It uses game mechanics to teach children about the seasons. This game intended to develop associational and logical thinking. By following the hints, children help the seasons change. They learn the order of the seasons and create a melody for each of them with a little help from their parents and the narrator. 'It’s Spring Again' is based on a successful puppet show for children ages 2 to 5, in which puppets controlled by actors showed children audience the magic of change of seasons. The game enriches the show by allowing children to directly interact with the story. The voice actor of the game’s narrator is a wonderful actress and a musician Ekaterina Efremova. She lives in Murmanks (Russia) her whole life, performing for children and adults at puppet theaters, singing songs to a guitar and other instruments. She cooperates with musicians working in different genres, loves improvisation and is never afraid of experimenting in her art.",
