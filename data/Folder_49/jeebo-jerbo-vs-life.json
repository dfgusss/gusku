The wonderful denizens here range from Dinosaurs, to Goo Creatures, to Shape People, to Office Workers! Not to mention those rapscallion Mr. Somethings! H A H A ! ! ! Don't venture outside of The Capital™, because the Bosquapital Forest can be a very dangerous place... Well enough about the city, let me tell you about your new job! Basically we here at CeratoCorp™ own the world's largest company business! What's a company business you ask? Well it's a business that houses dozens of other companies! We've got so many child companies, I can barely even keep track! Anyway, I know that most of our employees tend to be Office Workers, but for those with a lot of potential, we make exceptions. So congratulations! That means you must be incredibly special! So don't squander this AMAZING OPPORTUNITY!! Ohoho! Ok! We're almost ready, we just need you to sign this contract before you get started. Don't worry! It's nothing too out of the ordinary, just your basic information on company policies. Mostly just stuff about proper business conduct, punctuality, (never being able to leave), and other trivial things like that! All done? Splendid! Well Jeebs, I'm excited to work with you! Let me show you to your new cubicle... Jeebo &amp; Jerbo vs. Life Chapter 1: Jeebo &amp; Jerbo vs. The Dream Jeebo &amp; Jerbo vs. Life is a story focused Metroidvania/Party Based JRPG told in chapters! The overworld plays like a standard 2D Metroidvania where unlocking new party members allows you to access previously inaccessible locations due to their unique movement abilities! For example, Jeebo can wall jump, and Jerbo can pogo jump off of normally dangerous obstacles. It differs from standard Metroidvanias in that when you encounter an enemy the game switches into a Party Based JRPG where you must strategize your actions in order to succeed! Chapter 1 contains three playable characters, each with their own unique movement abilities to help aid in exploration and each with their own move set for use in battles! Work a mundane office job! Experience depression! Quit your mundane office job! Experience depression! Kill your former coworkers! Watch TV! Find meaning in your life! Fight a squirrel! Die a painful death! Meet like, over 15 different races! (Spoiler: One of them is Dinosaur Lawyers) Climb a tree! Crawl through the ventilation system of a hospital! Eat some baked goods that you found in the forest! Walk on some clouds! Find some baby birds! Hire a lawyer! And make many other questionable decisions! Start your adventure today in chapter one, Jeebo &amp; Jerbo vs. The Dream! *We would like to recommend avoiding that one squirrel. He's really strong. *No like, reeaaally strong *We mean it. We've never seen a squirrel that strong before",
