    "About the game": "Cancer cases are on the rise in Kamodo Steve’s home town. The constant, sweet, yet pervasive smell of chemicals burning in the air seems to have increased since Steve moved back to the area. One night while working his new job as a Janitor in a chemical plant, Steve uncovers the source of the cancer outbreak. The chemical plant where he works has been taken over by profiteering robber barons whose sole motivations are greed and government control. Armed with an arsenal of quirky, homemade weaponry and druid magic, Steve must overthrow the robber barons so the people of his town can heal. Kamodo Steve: Janitor on Fire! is a 2.5D platformer set in a world inspired by the post-industrial age. The game is inspired by fast shooting, reflex testing, action games similar to classic side scrollers. The player is equipped with an arsenal and controls similar to FPS Games. Checkpoints, boss battles, smooth melee animations and two player local co-op await. Features Explore large, post-industrial inspired landscapes with a surreal twist. Run and gun, blast, or tactically overcome obstacles. Expand your arsenal by collecting coins to purchase weapons. Discover mutant creatures and save them. Play solo or with a friend in local co-op mode. Experience fast paced action in a side scroller with first person shooter style controls. Join the Discord here-",
