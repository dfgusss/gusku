You need to work your way through the chain of racers out their putting their money and car's on the line. You need to show them who's back in town and ready to mix things up. You need a car. Where's the first place you go? The Junkyard At the junkyard you can find a plethora of junk cars to choose from. Some missing motors, others missing entire panels and suspension parts. Cars are sent here to die and you just happen to be one of the people that can save them. Taxis, Police Cars, Stunt Vehicles, Fire Response, and old daily junkers have all been left to rot. Pick 'parts' at the junkyard once a day. Who knows what you'll find at the junkyard? Street Racers All street racers have something to prove, and are willing to throw just about anything down on the line if your rep matches your trash talk. Every racer has a rep of their own and they are trying to protect it, but they won't waste their time on someone who doesn't have any rep in the local scene. You need to start at the bottom and work your way up the list. You can put money, cars, or even garages on the line if you're desparate enough. You can race the local crowd or work your way up The Chain . The Chain The chain is a mysterior group of street racers who bet high, risk high, and win high. Find them and win amazing riches! But be careful. There is a reason they are well known.",
