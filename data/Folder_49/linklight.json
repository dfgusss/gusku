    "About the game": "Linklight is a relaxing minimalist puzzle game in which you satisfyingly rotate objects to form elegant branching connections to power lightbulbs. With Linklight, you can take a break from the world around you; immersing yourself in the ambience while you rack your brain. Though it may be simple on the surface, Linklight can offer immense challenges to those who seek them; precision will be needed as you navigate your way through endless labyrinthine puzzles. In Linklight you are greeted with a colorful tranquil space in disarray. One after the other, you rotate objects, form elaborate connections, and avoid obstacles; forging your path to bring power to all of the scattered lightbulbs throughout the level. A level is only complete once all of its lightbulbs have been correctly powered. As you progress through the game you will be presented with new chapters, new challenges, and new objects; forcing you to think and adapt to whatever challenges you are faced with. Early Access: 75 handcrafted logic-based puzzles, featuring multiple solutions. An infinite number of customizable procedurally generated puzzles! (Released &amp; Receiving Incremental Updates) Progression; traverse through various sets of levels, all of which bring their own dreamlike design and unique challenges. Serene ambience; soothing ambient music tracks and sound effects. Particles! Linklight was developed by two college students, Daniel and Michael, from New York City. Together we founded Highrise Software with the goal of developing original and enjoyable indie games. Our game is still in early access and undergoing active development so please keep that in mind before you purchase! We are happy to receive feedback so please feel free to reach out to us if you have any thoughts or suggestions at all!",
