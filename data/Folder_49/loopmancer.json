Society is highly developed, but the gap between the haves and the have nots has only grown larger. Xiang Zixu, a brilliant private eye, is killed while investigating the disappearance of a famous female journalist . Immediately after his death, he wakes up with a start in his apartment bedroom. Before he can process what happened, his phone rings and his colleague at the agency tells him of a new case: the disappearance of a famous female journalist. Eye-pleasing Maps and Stages; Cyberpunk-style Eastern Cities This game features 7 finely-crafted large stages, including: Dragon Town, which comes alive with holiday spirit in the evening; the bleak and gloomy Shuigou Village; the luxurious Tang Dynasty Hotel; the maritime Bionic Beings' Training Base; and the Biotech Company...

Certain areas will change at random after each life loop. Select your favorite battle mode and investigate the ultimate truth. Rebirth Loop: Real or Fantasy After each death, Xiang Zixu will awaken in his apartment and begin a new loop. As the story progresses, reviewing what seemed like the correct choice in the past may lead to a different conclusion.
