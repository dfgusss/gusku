You play as a king fighting against the forces of evil, so your army is always at hand and its help will not be superfluous. And in this case, fighting monsters is a little easier than in other games. After all, you only need to click. Click on the icons, summon your warriors, bring down the forces of nature on the heads of your opponents. Getting rid of each enemy, you get coins with which you can improve your farm or your castle. After one army is finished, go to the boss. After all, it will appear after each level. And each subsequent one will be stronger than the previous one. If the army of terrible enemies is not stopped, then the world will not be the same.",
