This is not a demo version - you won't experience any spoilers here. The presented story is unique to this title. 'LFB: Scarlet' is the second introduction to the Lust from Beyond.

Moreover, we will present a new faction - Scarlet Lodge. Alan's mind is possessed by a hardly satisfiable sexual drive. To control his emotions, Alan meets with a psychiatrist who is supposed to solve his problems. During the session, Alan talks about a strange date in an abandoned theatre. The story quickly turns into an experience filled with dread and dark desires... - Bold erotic motives adapted to the horror convention - Interactive sex - Running from your opponents and fighting mechanics - A world inspired by the works of Lovecraft, Giger and Beksinski - Exploration of graphically advanced environment full of interactive objects - Ingenious puzzles - Vibrant sound and music",
