We're working hard to make the weapons handling as realistic as possible, but our focus is on out-there, open 180 degree ranges with lots of interactive targets and live multi-player. From this point on co-op modes, rescuing survivors etc. is easy to implement. We are constantly adding new weapons and insane/stupid challenges.
