ALL THE OFFICIAL CHAMPIONSHIP TRACKS In MXGP2 you’ll have the chance to ride on 18 official tracks from the 2015 FIM Motocross World Championship, to live the amazing experience of MXoN and to scrub in the made-up indoor circuits. CUSTOMIZE YOUR BIKE AND RIDER What about creating your own personal team? With MXGP2 you can choose the name and logo for your team, buy your favorite bikes, custom liveries and accessories for your bike and rider. Enjoy changing the performance of your two wheels. The challenge begins here! MXoN Enjoy the new MXoN game mode: choose a nation and ride with all its representatives in turn!
