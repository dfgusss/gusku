    "About the game": "Over 13 years, and over 130 games. All made by one hobbyist-turned-full-time developer. And now, for the first time, available in one cohesive package in the form of NAL Is Alive! NAL Is Alive is a compendium containing everything by NAL, released under the NALGames pseudonym between 2003 and today, wrapped up in a launcher that also universally tracks your statistics and highscores for each game*, the latter being compared against the world in Steam-exclusive online leaderboards*. Containing the good - Maddening Relapse 2! Hi Me Ro Me! Innoquous 4! Ne Touchez Pas! Prisnhax! Frankenfirearm! Lab Wagon! And the bad - Aardvark Cwm! Gemocide! Clickfire! ...and almost everything inbetween! Ever wanted to work it on a pogo stick? SohoPogoHo hears you! Fancy going around peeing on people? Signal Failure! You can assume the role of a redhead killing your opposers of the world in Infidels, or become a little robot fixing the big robot it resides in with Titan Tighten. Need a rhythm game fix while also improving your touch typing proficiency? Bullet Hills sees you typing to the music! Need a music game that has instead has no rhythm? Melodika gets you to suck a stream of icons into a recepticle to any track of your choosing! Need to inject yourself to help forget the nightmarous legion of female stalkers planning on kissing you to death? Yeah, that's in here too with Overly Attracted Stalkers. So's the one where you're a dog in a ball unloading clips of everything from water pistols to rocket shotguns at mutant bags of blood - Lyssandra and the Amplegores. And the one where you get to play an interactive advert for a fictional Japanese dish cleaner while a man touts its superior viscosity to you, Japanese Infomercial. All of these and more, being taken through an ongoing process to bring them up to spec* - dropping the MIDI music from the really old stuff in favour of more listenable MP3s, knocking every game's resolution and FPS up to 1080p/60 (potentially again up to 4K in the future), improving their gameplay and their graphics, adding the aforementioned Steam leaderboards... you name it. It's presented in a somewhat light-hearted way, and many of the games are pretty silly, but this pack truly does represent a huge chunk of my life - everything I made independently from being an 11 year old kid that had to download Game Maker 5.0 onto a school computer and bring it home on 3.5' floppy discs thanks to the speed of my home internet, to a currently 25 year old making games and other stuff full-time. *Please note: not all games will support the update features during NAL Is Alive's Early Access development. As of writing, approx 80 games contain Steam Leaderboards, and approx 40 are completely upscaled to 1080p/60.",
