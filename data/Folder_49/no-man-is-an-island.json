    "About the game": "And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee. 2030, Zombie virus swept the world, the infected people were isolated to some closed islands. Some organizations hold zombie hunting competitions. In a hunting, you're infected with the virus and abandoned on an island. The hunt is not over and you've gone from hunter to prey. Now Players can explore the island and collect many kinds of supplies, food, water, medicine and so on, as well as combat equipment. Some natural food that you can find on the island. There are many animals living on the island. You can hunt for survival, but the animals are very alert. Be careful not to let them detect you. A loud noise will alarm surrounding creatures and Zombies will come when they hear the sound. Build Shelters, store supplies, and only items in boxes will be preserved. Every 3 days, the Hunt takes place. When fighting with Hunters, keep moving and look for shelters. They will burst fire . If you are far away from them, be careful of grenades. Soon there will be Robots involved in cleaning up Zombies, and you are also their target. These Robots are a terrible threat. You can collect materials or mine to make some equipment to improve your combat effectiveness and defense. The Hunter will bring supplies, defeat them can get supplies, the hunter's camp has a lot of supplies, but the camp is protected by guards, if you have the courage, you can rob these supplies. On this island, there are infected people like you. They have established shelters too, but now they will not work with you, you can rob their supplies and attack their shelters just as they do to you. There is also a restricted area on the island, which is surrounded by poisonous fog and can not be set foot in yet. Maybe it's hard to survive now, but in the future you're going to gain tremendous power, and you'll dominate the island, or even more.",
