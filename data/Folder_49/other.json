    "About the game": "The game starts ! Each turn you collect a clue card, you can have a maximum of 9 in your hand. If you have the letters O, T, H, E, R in your hand, you can say OTHER and a random player will be eliminated, if all players are eliminated except you, you win. When it is your turn to play you can exchange 2 clue cards for an event card. There are over 10 different event cards to shake up the game such as: - Drawing two clue or event cards - All players discard two cards - The opponent of your choice picks up his or her clue or event hand But be aware that the number of event cards is limited and some of the event cards are cards that have no effect. You can have a maximum of 5 event cards in your hand. When a game is created, a time limit is set for the players' turns, which can range from 15 to 60 seconds.",
