    "About the game": "In childhood parents told you that you would become a janitor in future, but you did not live up to their expectations and became a top manager? Even if not, in this game you will be able to play the role of utility worker. Carry out various assignments from utility services, get money for it and enjoy the atmosphere of the Siberian city. Your task is to save up for a ticket to leave the city and start a new life. Open world: You enter the endless open world of the city of panel houses. It consists a lot of procedurally generated objects: roads, houses, playgrounds, garages, schools and other structures. The main feature of the Sibreain city are panel houses, uniquely generated both outside and inside. No house is like any other. Snow digging: In Panelki you can interact with snow. Dig snowdrifts in the entrances, cars, clean the roofs of houses or just build a giant snow tower. With the help of different shovels you will be able to dig more and more snow. Weather and time of day: The Panelki world has dynamic weather and day/night cycle. Full immersion in weather conditions: from a heavy blizzard at night to a quiet snowfall at noon. If you stay in the cold for a long time, the player starts to freeze. You can warm up in the indoors. Items: Come into the basement. There you will find useful items such as shovels, intercom keys, light bulbs, snowman carrots, a flashlight, or other things. You can turn on heating in the basements. Cinematic mode: In Panelki you can stop anytime and anywhere, turn on the camera and capture the harsh view of the Siberian city. Due to a lot of image settings, you can give the picture any mood. You will also need a camera in the game: if you have completed all the actions in the house, you can take a photo of it from the outside and get some in-game money for the picture. * all screenshots are taken with in game cinematic mode.",
