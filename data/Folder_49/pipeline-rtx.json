    "About the game": "PIPELINE RTX is a strategic puzzle game. The goal of the game is impossibly simple: you need to turn the various parts of the pipe into certain positions, so that in the end the water can, albeit with a large number of meanders, but pass through the water supply. What's in the game: - various levels, sometimes with obstacles on the way - high quality graphics, such that not every retired plumber would distinguish from real life - variability of passing levels, it is not necessary to do what is intended - fluidity of water through pipes (this makes it easier to understand that a particular pipe is connected or not connected to the water supply) In general, go for it, have fun and invite your grandfather to play! He will definitely get such an understandable and vital gameplay)",
