    "About the game": "Released in 2013 Project Syria was originally commissioned by the World Economic Forum and created at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, this immersive journalism piece focuses on the plight of these children. By coupling pioneering virtual reality technologies with audio and video captured at a tragic event, Project Syria transports audiences to the a scene as the story unfolds. Nearly one half of Syria’s 23 million people have been displaced in its civil war and no group has been as severely affected as children. Children make up more than half of the three million refugees living in camps or makeshift housing and some news reports indicate that children are actually being specifically targeted in the violence.",
