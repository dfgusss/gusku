    "Name": "Project Tank",
    "Release date": "Mar 1, 2018",
    "About the game": "You start the game with a simple tank that is barely able to kill anything and as you complete quest, kill, loot and upgrade you will become stronger. You will traverse trough a big open world, dungeons, enemies and more to try to be the best! The tanks are customizable. Choose a class first and as you get more equipped and upgrade your skill tree, you will get closer to the tank you dream of. The game will be released as a single player/multiplayer game and if everything is going great, it will become a MMO as intended. Take in note that the game will be kept updated regularly.",
