    "About the game": "This JRPG was made for true JRPG fans. A fun throwback to the old days of gaming, this game was made as my tribute to old school JRPGs with four elements of JRPGs in mind: -LOTS OF ITEMS -LOTS OF WEAPONS -LOTS OF ENEMIES -LOTS OF EXPLORING In PsyOps Solutions, you are an employee sent out on a Government contract. Your only mission is to complete the contract, which is to kill General Swanson. This contract was given by the Government to PsyOps Solutions after the Rebel forces invaded Pixeltown and killed all of the Government Forces in the area. It may sound easy, but you are going to need to become powerful enough to be able to complete that mission. There is a lot of enemies to fight, side missions to complete, exploring to do and weapons to obtain. What are you waiting for? Get to work PsyOps Employee, Badge #246! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- IMPORTANT NOTE CERTAIN AREAS OF THE MAP MAY NOT HAVE DOORS ON THE BUILDINGS. IN FUTURE UPDATES, THESE AREAS AND NEW MAPS WILL BECOME PLAYABLE (ALONG WITH ACHIEVEMENTS) IN THE FUTURE",
