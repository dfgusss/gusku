    "About the game": "Reproduction Man is a 2D puzzler where you help some very simple-minded sperm get to the egg. This cult classic of the Windows shareware era was brought back for its 20th anniversary with all-new graphics, animation and sound. The puzzles may get difficult - and the sperm won't get any smarter - but you must persevere. Do it for the children! Proceeds from this game will go toward the wedding of my now-twenty-year-old daughter, whose conception was the inspiration for this game.",
