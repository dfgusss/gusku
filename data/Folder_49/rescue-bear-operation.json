    "About the game": "Want to save some animals, and their habitats!? Rescue Bear Operation is: an introductory, 1-level, all ages, child friendly, free to play, mini game designed to create awareness around saving animals, &amp; their habitats! We are a thought leader in Environmental Sustainability issues. We'll be donating at least 30% of our net proceeds to charitable causes. Rescue Bear is intentionally kept simple and accessible. There are two objectives. One: save as many friendly critters as you can! Two: save as many trees by putting out the wild fires! By doing this you will accumulate points that can be used as in-game currency to purchase unique cosmetic items in game. (E.g. hats, shirts, etc) Or; if you want to help good causes in giving back to 'trusted' real world charities and organizations dedicated towards issues of climate change (e.g wildfires, flooding, etc) we also offer unique downloadable content (DLC) that can be purchased with real world currency as well. Together - we *will* make a difference! Most of all, please have fun playing the game! Thank you!",
