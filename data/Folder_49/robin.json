    "About the game": "WHAT IS ROBIN? Robin is a free short slice of life vignette that was made to give some visibility to an invisible illness - Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (or myalgic encephalopathy). Live out three days in the life of Robin, a CFS sufferer, and try to manage your time as best you can. What you decide to do in these days is up to you, but know that there is never such a thing as a perfect ending. Built around the concept of spoon theory, Robin is a quick, relatable insight into the struggles of living with CFS/ME.",
