    "About the game": "This game is a bit like backgammon, but you're dealing with more than just random dice rolls. More unstable elements fill the entire map! But that doesn't mean you can only win by luck, your strategy will be the key to winning the trophy! More strange grid effects, and they will trigger in a chain. This means that sometimes the situation will be too complicated to predict, trust your intuition, or calmly analyze and win? It's all up to you. Every character is unique - they all have different abilities, and using them wisely can help you stand out from other players' teams! As the game progresses, you can unlock more characters and different map contents. Expand your collection, and grow your team. Can you collect all the characters? Come and try it!",
