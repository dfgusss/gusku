    "About the game": "Indie Game made by a small company (JammSoft). Is a funny 2D where you are able to break the laws of physics by doing jumps, double jumps and Walljumps ( use Z for the different combos). You can defeat all your enemies using squid's ultimate weapon, by pressing X. As the Sun starts to transform into a red giant, every planet, except Pluto, is joining forces to save the Solar System from certain demise. The Plutonians, feeling left behind and undermined, decide to send Squid, their strongest warrior, to finish off the 8 Emperors of the Solar System, that form Vexus. In his journey, Squid will find hordes of enemies in planets with technology much more advanced than his own. Will Squid exact revenge for his people? Only you can decide.",
