    "About the game": "Stage Fright is a single player rhythm and horror game where you take the role of a piano prodigy who is overwhelmed by musical performance anxiety. This anxiety manifests itself as a supernatural ghost girl, the mysterious HANNAH, who haunts your concerts to strain your ability and sanity. The game is played with Guitar-Hero-style beatmatching mechanics - however, the better you do, the more horror elements you will get! Jump scares, unsettling visual elements, and even UI breakdowns are in store as the the game itself tries to prevent you from succeeding. You will experience stage fright. The question is, how will you deal with it? 7 original songs at release! Enjoy the haunting piano melodies of composers Larry Shen and Jeff Huang. Procedural Horror! Our system will recognize how well you are playing and mess with you while you're doing well. Play on a computer keyboard or use a MIDI Controller! Stage Fright can be played with both. Discover the story! Piece together the horror elements to figure out who HANNAH is, and why she is haunting you.",
