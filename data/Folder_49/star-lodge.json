    "About the game": "Star Lodge is a strategy card game for adults with over 50 unique playable cards! The card game is played solo like solitaire. Each turn there are three cards drawn (including possible duplicates). Only cards the player can use are drawn. The player must choose the most helpful or least harmful card available from the three cards drawn. Resource management is necessary to access cards needed to make progress in winning the card match. There is a green health bar which is increased or decreased by some cards. Losing all health ends the current card match. There is also a purple progress bar which is increased by some cards as indicated in the card text. When the progress bar is full, the player wins the current card match. The game begins with 25 cards already unlocked! When the player wins a card match, one additional card is unlocked for use in later matches (up until all cards are unlocked). Alternatively, a new card can be unlocked by collecting 100 coins across multiple matches.",
