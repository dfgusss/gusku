    "About the game": "Now with Online Multiplayer and Online Leaderboards If you're wondering how your friends are able to beat the map, why not play with them and have a look yourself (using the Spectator Mode!)! Stickit can now be played online, both on the main level and on custom user created levels, together with your friends! Furthermore scores are submitted to online Steam Leaderboards, both for the main level and for user created levels! See who can beat levels the fastest! Now with Level Editor and Steam Workshop integration If the difficulty of the main level isn't quite to your liking, try your hand at making your entirely own levels with the provided in-game Level Editor, or download community created levels directly from the Steam Workshop! Stickit is a brutal first person platforming game about climbing higher and higher to reach your ultimate goal, The Golden Stick. At your disposal is the very simple mechanic of sticking to walls and ceilings, no complex control schemes or wonky physics, so how hard can it be? Whilst the only way forward is up, the way up isn't always obvious. The level contains multiple routes, and for those technically gifted players you will likely be able to find skips around obstacles entirely. Be careful however, because once you fall and are unable to find your footing on the platforms below you, the only way back up is the very same path you came... But it's simple really, just jump and stick it. Features Tight and satisfying controls, Stick to walls and ceilings by dashing Hard to master, whilst sticking to surfaces might seem simple, there's a hidden mechanic to it that will allow you to find new paths. In-game Level Editor and Steam Workshop integration, if the main level isn't your thing then try creating your own levels and share them with others on the Steam Workshop! Steam Leaderboards, times for the main level and user created levels are submitted on stored on Steam Leaderboards, see who's the fastest! Online Multiplayer, play online with your friends and find the way forward together! You can even play together on user created levels! A massive level, many many hours to beat it, if you're even able to. Non-linear level, there's almost always more than one way up, which one will suit you? And for those in a rush, finding new paths entirely to skip obstacles is very much encouraged. Heatmap of player mistakes, every single of your failures is stored for you to see Speedrunner friendly, both speedrunning split timer and a segment practice mode is in the game. Furthermore the nature of the game lends itself perfectly to speedrunning. Find alternate paths and climb even faster.
