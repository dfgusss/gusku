    "About the game": "A strange deck of playing cards. A stranger appearing from a sudden storm. The sheltering doorway of a lonely manor. Unliving dolls smiling emptily as they chase you down. They just want you to join them. Forever. String Tyrant is a survival horror game where you must look, think, hide, and if necessary, fight your way out of a mysterious mansion filled with monsters and traps. If you're defeated by a monster or fall for a trap, you'll be ensnared by the manor's residents - and join them to hunt your former friends. At least you'll be a pretty doll. The game has an active card-based combat system where you build combos using your magical cards. You can hear nearby enemies through doors and walls, can open and close doors to try to break line-of-sight, and must contend with traps that will tax your wits. You'll need to unlock the secrets of the manor to stand a real chance of escape. A free demo is provided . Please ensure system compatibility with the demo before purchasing the full game. The demo covers the first 'phase' of the game, featuring one enemy types, three doll types, and two endings. The full game contains more enemy types, traps, environmental hazards, new equipment, and the rest of the game's story.",
