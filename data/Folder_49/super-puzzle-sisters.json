    "About the game": "Super Puzzle Sisters is a brand new ‘Action Puzzle’ game with a twist. Players are able to move and punch blocks to create crazy combos in up to 4 player Local Multiplayer Battles!! Overview Designed like Old School Arcade Puzzle Games, Super Puzzle Sisters encourages players to stack Blocks to create crazy combo chains in order to destroy their opponents. The Big Twist in Super Puzzle Sisters is that Blocks don’t pop on their own, instead Players are given full control to destroy the Blocks when they want to, this allows Players to create huge Combo chains and activate them at just the right time! On top of that Players can also use Special Moves, these can damage your opponents by giving them more Blocks, Reversing their controls and even covering their screen with Clouds. Though the best offence is a good defense and you can also use Special Moves to save yourself by getting rid of every Block of a certain colour or by throwing exploding Water Balloons to get rid of a bunch of them in one go! Cast Super Puzzle Sisters has a cast of 6 Cute Characters, each with their own Special Moves and Strategies, do you pick the reliable and easy Pulse or mix things up with the glass cannon of Persimmon? And to top it all off, the Sisters are fully voiced and are brimming with personalities.
