    "About the game": "Swordcery: Prologue is a free prologue for the currently-in-development rogue-like Swordcery, a melee-based action RPG. Test your mettle (but also your metal) as you discover and unleash the power behind a multitude of magical swords to defeat an otherworldly Celestial evil! Your quest will challenge your reactions, lead you through treacherous biomes, and pit you against the most formidable enemies and bosses. FIGHT THE CORRUPTION A giant blade has plunged into the Earth bringing a hail of smaller blades along with it. The calamitous sword, stabbed into the mountains, seems to be draining the power of the Earth itself and with each passing day the rain of swords grows heavier and heavier. To undo this vile corruption, you’ll play as Colt, an unwitting hero who has gained the ability to wield the fallen blades. UNLEASH THE POWER OF SPELLBOUND BLADES As you venture forth, each new sword you find will come with a unique ability known as each weapon’s Swordcery. These abilities allow you to perform magical feats like: hurling your sword out in boomerang-like fashion, thundering down as a bolt of lightning, opening up hellfire fissures, or summoning a ring of protective icy swordflakes! MASTER THE BLADE Every blade you find is categorized into a 'Sword Class!' Each class will have its own light attack combo and a unique heavy attack option (these range from a heavy attack combo to a completely unique mechanic only available to that specific class). Certain classes may be more advantageous due to terrain or the combat situation. It is up to you to master each sword class' melee attack options and use them in conjunction with your mighty swordcery abilties! Swordcery: Prologue features the following classes: Shortsword, Titan Sword, Katana, and Dual Swords! THE FLOW OF COMBAT Combat in Swordcery fuses souls-like melee action with unique magical sword abilities tied to each weapon. The pacing of combat can be intense if you are surrounded by foes! Or it can be quite deliberate/methodical if you are approaching each encounter with caution. Enemy encounters will test your ability to recognize enemy patterns, reactions to telegraphed attacks, your ability to utilize both melee and various magical attacks, as well as your resource management skills while in the heat of battle. FORGED FOR REPLAYABILITY Discover a myriad of new swords each playthrough, find various active/passive relics, choose new sword class upgrades to power yourself up, and trek through procedurally generated dungeons — Swordcery will offer you new challenges and weapons to explore each time!",
