The game is easy to pick up but hard to master, and ensures a fun challenge for the whole family. Currently the game features a Zen Mode and a Time Attack Mode, which allows you to play the game at your own pace. So whether you want to relax after a long day at work or get your daily cardio – that is entirely up to you. We are expanding upon the game during early access to keep it entertaining and fresh while adding variety and replayability.",
