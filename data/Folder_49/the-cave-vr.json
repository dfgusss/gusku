    "About the game": "The Cave is a 2 in 1 VR bundle. An arcade game and a real world fear experience. At start scene you can choose: 1. The Arcade game and have lots of fun in a 'quest for diamonds' action game trying to collect as many diamonds as fast as you can on a dangerous plank while avoiding oscillating hanging wood logs. You have to try! Few games are designed so close to real VR power! (review by the real vr gamers @ Mallorca) 2.The second option is an experience designed to make you feel sensations nearly impossible in real life without physical danger. It's not about puzzle or quiz games to achieve goals, it's about feeling. Feel, watch, hear and enjoy almost real sensations. We believe VR is a new language and as such we designed a realistic cave environment with a deep pit that you can try to cross on a narrow inestable wood plank. A great experience for you and your friends. Live it alone or watch your friends in a dangerous situation. How will they react? Horror? Laugh? Fun? You will also have in your hands a valuable spotlight to help you in the darkness of the deep pit. Come on! Do you dare? People will talk about it! As our company mantra says: beThere",
