    "About the game": "Explore the empty Russian streets, filled with depressive athmosphere. Find all the interesting places. Feel the sharm of an lately abandoned post-soviet town. Walk through all the streets and avenues you can find. Gameplay Walk through all the streets and avenues you can find in this city, filled with panel buildings, that are common fo Russia. All you can do is to explore and discover all the points of interest you can find. Map There are two maps with different settings - winter and early autumn. Soviet buildings, concrete fences, broken roads, trees growing where they shouldn't be, mud and rust literally everywhere. That's the feeling of athmosphere. Graphics The graphics were meant to be the 1:1 copy of the real world. All the modern features of post-processing were used in the game.",
