    "About the game": "ALL ABOARD! Grab your shipmates and go head to head in this asymmetrical PvP game that's as fun to watch as it is to play. Deceit and destruction come together in a shared screen experience, where you have to keep your enemy guessing your next move. Take control of The Mutineer and sabotage the engines of the ship while seamlessly blending in with AI controlled engineers. Act natural and move with the crowds while disabling engines along the way. Have a set number of engines disabled to win! Take control of The Overseer and watch your screen carefully for The Mutineer, maintain your engines and give orders to fix and repair any engines that have been sabotaged. Kick suspicious engineers off the ship and try to find The Mutineer, but be careful - you've got a limited number of guesses! Game Features: Dynamic Gameplay: Multiple win conditions, maps, and custom rules means loads of replay-ability! Challenging Singleplayer: Our realistic AI means that singleplayer plays differently every time. Simple Controls: 3 buttons means that any player can learn to play, on keyboard or gamepad!",
