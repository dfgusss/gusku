    "About the game": "Planet Naizyr. Six-hundred years after the impact of the source. A ceasefire between the sex-cultured westerners and the goddess-following easterners. On this day, the missing eastern prince walks into western territory and is captured. Before his execution, he is pardoned by a woman with glowing eyes. She is interested in his face tattoo. These two authority figures strike a deal and begin a journey to the east. The journey is anything but uneventful and many characters are thrown into the chaos. A vigilante, a bureaucrat, a media personality, a warrior princess, an indentured servant, an artist, a prostitute, and an engineer all play a part in the fate of Planet Naizyr. Influence the characters thoughts and decisions with your choices at points of change. Make a good character go bad or a lustful one go celibate. Push a character or event too much and you may lose control. Change is unpredictable and it's a good thing you can go back to a point of change and undo. Stand firm in your choices or view all possible timelines, the choice is yours. What will become of the people, and the planet, when you are done? FEATURES Photo-realistic characters and backgrounds Full voice acting, even minor characters Voices, music and sound effects can be muted 10 different interlocking stories Choices affect all characters Unlock choices in rewind menu Rewind unlocked events to change outcomes Bisexual romances Alien anatomy Frequent nudity and sex scenes Alternate endings",
