    "About the game": "Black Lives Matter. All developer earnings from the Whisperer in Darkness (as of July 2020) will be donated to Anti-Racist nonprofit organizations, starting with the Marsha P. Johnson Institute. Note: The Whisperer in Darkness is a short, focused experience which takes under an hour for a full playthrough. The story has no branching choices, and only one ending. Rumors resurface. Legends are resurrected. The Whisperer in Darkness is a visual novel based on the cosmic horror story by H.P. Lovecraft. Play as Alex N. Wilmarth, skeptic and professor at Miskatonic University, as you unravel the hideous secrets centered at a secluded farm in the hills of Vermont, coming ever closer to mortal peril. 8 chapters of authentic Lovecraftian horror. Experience a linear story through painted illustrations, ASCII art, atmospheric sound effects, an unsettling musical score, and frantic email correspondence with a conspiracy theorist who might be a little too close to the truth. No guns, no fighting. Just you, alone to discover what lies hidden in the world you thought you knew. Once you find the truth, can you ever go back?",
