There are simple rules: After your first touch, you must return the ball in 10 seconds, or it will explode, and you'll lose! While jumping, you can use a small dash in either direction, or up. But remember it takes 5 seconds to load again. In the arcade mode, there are items you can collect to temporarily change the size of the spheres , bringing funny situations to the game.
