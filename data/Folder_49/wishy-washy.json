    "About the game": "Wishy Washy is a 2D pixel art game about cleaning windows in a city of disasters. Nuclear meltdowns, giant squid attacks, and an aerial assault from a flying spaghetti monster have left this city in need of a deep cleaning, and you’re here to do it. You follow the game’s protagonist in their daily work life attempting to fulfill customer requests to wipe buildings clean. It’ll take swift, precise movements to finish your jobs before dark—before the next disaster strikes.",
