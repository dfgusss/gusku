    "About the game": "Woebegone Woods is a casual worker placement game with a focus on relationship building. Enter the Woebegone Woods, a small, warm village in the middle of a cold and remote forest. Play as Bean, and manage the winter festival that brings in the spring and fends off the mythical Woebegone by assigning woodland friends to work on tasks, balancing their happiness and skills. Kindle friendships while also putting on the best festival possible! As winter rages on and talk of the Woebegone resurface, a small group of woodland friends come together to throw a winter festival not only to hold of the cold, but to form a friendly and cozy community, with the help of newcomer, Bean. Assign characters at tasks separately or together to balance progress toward the festival and relationships. Foster friendships with all the members of the community through helping them work together. Learn the stories of each of your friends through multiple in-game years as more arrive in the woods to join in the festivities! Key Features: Single Player Experience: - Worker Placement Gameplay: Assign characters to complete tasks for the winter festival - Relationship Building: Build character relationships in the village by working together on tasks and keeping everyone happy - Relatable Narrative: Get to know everyone in the village on a personal level through engaging dialogue - Multiple Year Progression: Relationships continue to build over the course of three years, affecting how the festival plays out in consecutive years",
