    "About the game": "Zodicat is a pacifist cat who wants to protect the galaxy. To achieve this, he have to light the star-bulb within a limited time. Can he bring back the light in the 150 stages with the pacifist run? Main characteristics [The weakest hero in the history of platformer!] Zodicat can only move left or right using the arrow keys. He can’t attack any enemies, and he can’t even jump without using the jump blocks or rockets. Only your endurance and spirit can help Zodicat. [Fierce enemies on the trail] In contrast to Zodicat, the weakest platformer hero, the enemies which he have to face are not weak at all. Deadly designed levels and enemies will make you and Zodicat suffer. Maybe the player will retire before Zodicat saves the galaxy. [Massive numbers of the stage] 150 stages will be available in the game. They are designed with the theme related to the 12+1 zodiac, and have unique visual and background music.",
