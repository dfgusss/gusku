Confused about her feelings for someone, Lucia, the main character, decides to flee from her city and wanders through a smaller town where she’s never been, searching for herself while still tormented by the thought of the person she’s attracted to. The project is an interactive experience divided into 11 segments, each corresponding to a song from Red Ribbon’s new album “Planet X”. Lose yourself into Lucia’s mindscape, divided between her thoughts, drawings and music she’s listening to through her journey to re-discover her own self. A narrative shaped around Red Ribbon’s “Planet X” album An interactive stream of consciousness developed by the choices made during each scene A mixture of comics, animation and interactive fiction elements A short and replayable story",
