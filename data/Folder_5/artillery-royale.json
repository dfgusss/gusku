It's an artillery game, where you aim and shoot using a range of weapons. Turn by turn you have to kill each of your opponent’s characters, either by inflicting them a deadly shot or throwing them into the lava. Plan ahead to win the battle! Include: More than 20 weird or classic weapons like bazooka, grenade but also more funky surprises coming up. A random map generator, making each game unique. Multiplayer local games (couch mode with shared screen) or online games. Classic and fun artillery mechanics. Play with physics! Watch out for the wind direction, some weapons are more sensible than others to it than others. Use grenade bounces to achieve (or fail) tricky shots. Destroy everything! The world is fully destroyable, blow a big hole to trap your enemy. If you are cornered why not dig your way out using your favorite weapon! Indie game with a passionate team listening to your feedback! Join our discord and let us know what you like, dislike, and share your ideas. Coming up: More levels with different themes. More weapon (20 are in the pipeline). More character for your team (planned to have 5 different classes). Your own idea here.",
