Only by working together can the Assassins defeat their mortal enemies.

The Da Vinci Disappearance Single-Player and Multiplayer DLC: After the fall of the Borgias, Leonardo Da Vinci is kidnapped and Ezio will embark on a relentless quest to recover him discovering new locations and gameplay features.
