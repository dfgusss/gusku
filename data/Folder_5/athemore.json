    "About the game": "Story You play as the professional treasure hunter Jerome, who’s recently left the guild, because the other members benefited too much from your hard work and experience. You have finally realized that you are far better off working alone. The scene takes place in an abandoned ancient dungeon. The word around town says the dungeon is haunted and without any details about the place, no one ever dared to set foot down there. Luckily you have managed to get hold of a map of the place. After arriving at the ruin, your main goal is now to locate and grab an exceptional artifact. Unfortunately, others share the same goal as you How to play During gameplay, you are going to make some choices and sacrifices, which affects the outcome of how the game progresses. There’s no right and wrong. The dungeon holds many clues about the dark past. You will find some interesting objects. Some objects are collectable and some are readable. The crosshair turns green, if you look at objects of interest. Also, watch out for dangers such as traps, pits and enemies. You will die instantly if you aren’t observant. Luckily there’s several checkpoints across the dungeon.",
