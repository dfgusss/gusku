    "About the game": "An arcade-style shooter that challenges you not to defend yourself; DEFEND THE HIVE! Defend it from the birds, defend it from the insects, defend it from... oh, just play the game to find out. How long can you last against the onslaught? Can you break the online top-15 leaderboard? Use a variety of powerups and keyboard-and-mouse skill to fly through an evolving world thats only goal is to destroy your hive. BeeFend! This is the first game from the worlds most inexperienced developers. A perfect game to play while stuff downloads in the background! Features: Original hand-drawn graphics! Original soundtrack! Online leaderboards! Gamepad compatibility for twin-stick action! This game is the culmination of 3 friends who wanted to make a video game but didn't have a remote idea as to where to start. Half-way through development, we hosted a panel at the 2017 RetroGameCon in Syracuse, NY. We told the crowd we'd release this game on Steam when it was ready. We're following through on that promise!",
