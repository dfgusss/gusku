    "About the game": "Blastboard is a billiards-like puzzle game. Use your mouse to shoot the white cue ball and clear all other balls from the table. In addition to dropping the balls into pockets, you can erase them by making two or more of the same color touch. Blastboard has a PvP mode where 2 to 6 players can play together. Both online play and local play using a single mouse are available. Game Modes “Minimal” A game mode where players compete to clear tables in the smallest number of shots. The mode is designed primarily with solo play in mind, but it's also available in multiplayer. “Point Ball” A PvP-only game mode. Players alternate turns every shot and compete for points by clearing balls from the table. After all tables are cleared, the player with the highest score wins. Types of Balls Color Ball Begins to glow when struck by another ball of the same color. Glowing balls vanish after they’ve stopped moving. Ice Ball Begins to glow when struck by a ball that’s already glowing. Thunder Ball When struck by another ball, all balls of the same color as the ball that struck it and the Thunder Ball itself vanish. Eight Ball Only appears in Point Ball mode. Eight Balls are worth eight points, but they become heavier in proportion to the number of balls left. Other Features Tables (levels) are randomly generated. You can retry the same table sets by specifying seed values (Regular Mode only.) The velocity deceleration behavior of the balls is derived from analysis of real billiard balls in motion. Color assist mode is available. Note: you can also play local PvP via Remote Play Together, but it’s not recommended due to difficulties regarding shared mouse operation.",
