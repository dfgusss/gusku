    "About the game": "Born Into Fear is a first person horror game set in an empty suburban neighborhood called North Hollow Heights. Its residents have all been murdered in a single night by an organization lauded as the protectors of humanity. You are Agent Jay, a member of this organization: Aegis. Aegis has asked you to search the lifeless homes, gather the results from their experiment, and eliminate any evidence, including the Buffer they’ve created, “Sally.” However, you have another reason to work with Aegis: your mother has been missing for a year, and the only clue you have points you towards North Hollow Heights. If you ever want to see her again, you’ll have to deal with the monsters lurking there, one way or another. North Hollow Heights was an ordinary neighborhood before Aegis’ experiment. Its people lived happy lives in their homes filled with love and laughter. Now, those same homes lie dead and silent. While you seek out a way to destroy the Buffer, uncover the truth of the experiment. Earn Sally’s trust by following her commands and rules. Maybe, you’ll even help the deceased pass on. Gameplay - Explore the homes of North Hollow Heights and learn the fates of their occupants - Avoid the creatures roaming the streets or risk their wrath - Meet some of the former souls who lived in North Hollow Heights and speak with them - Don’t forget to do your chores - Decide “Sally’s” fate - Make your Mom proud",
