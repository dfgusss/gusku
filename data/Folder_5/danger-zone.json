    "About the game": "Danger Zone is a 3D vehicular destruction game from independent British developer and seasoned genre veterans Three Fields Entertainment. The concept is simple : crash for cash by creating the biggest car crashes. Welcome to the Danger Zone – our virtual Crash Testing Facility. Step into the shoes of a dangerous driver and survive a variety of challenging crash testing scenarios. It’s easy to crash, but can you also grab all of the Bonus Pickups? Powered by Unreal Engine, Danger Zone combines real physical crashes with explosive gameplay. Shunt vehicles into oncoming traffic, take down trailers to shed their payloads and use your explosive “Smashbreaker” to move your vehicle around. The more explosions you cause, the bigger your score. If you’re feeling burnt out by congestion and jammed roads, take the highway to the Danger Zone. Take your revenge on rush hour traffic. This place is a paradise for those who like their driving flame-grilled. Features: Single Player Game Mode featuring 32 unique crash testing scenarios. Connected Leaderboards allows comparison of player scores for Friends and the whole world.",
