    "About the game": "Download DCL - The Game and fly on the world’s most spectacular Drone Racing tracks. DCL - The Game is the official videogame of the Drone Champions League - the world’s leading series for Drone Racing Teams. An innovative race series, blurring the lives between virtual and reality. Join the flying revolution! WHAT PILOTS SAY Alex 'Chief' Campbell (QuadForceOne): 'It feels like flying a real drone.' Andrzej 'SirCrashALot' Krasny: 'This is by far the best Drone Simulator on the market. It enables pilots to race on authentic DCL tracks in epic locations. I can't wait to race against my best friends online.' Angelo Felchle: 'The DCL Game is perfect to practice the hardest and most spectacular tracks in the world. I'm playing a lot if I don't have the time to go outside and fly to stay in shape and get stick-time.' FLY AROUND THE WORLD Fly through over 30 spectacular tracks and compete online against other pilots from all over the World! Discover real drone racing tracks like the snow halfpipes of LAAX or the castle ruins of Reutte. Race through the incredible Proptown and Oilbando, as well as other real-world DCL races locations: each will present a new and unique challenge and will demand all your piloting skills! ARCADE OR SIMULATION? DCL - The Game presents the perfect challenge for every experience level. You can have fun with the Arcade mode even if you have never seen a drone before. You can improve your skills as an amateur pilot or you can practice and compete as an experienced pilot. You will be able to fly in four flight modes: Arcade Mode:  Perfect for racing thanks to the automated altitude control and simplified controls. GPS Mode:  Flies like your standard camera drone, with stabilization and altitude control: it's Ideal to practice your piloting and filming skills, but not designed for racing. Angle Mode:  Also known as Stabilized mode, it's available on most amateur racing drones and great for practicing. Not ideal for top racing performance. Acro Mode:  This is how the real drone racing and freestyle pilots control their drones. You will have the complete control over the aircraft, in order to compete at the highest levels. It will take some time and dedication to master but it will allow you to experience flying at its fullest! FLY LIKE A PRO! Control your drone with a keyboard, gamepad or - for the ultimate simulation - connect your transmitter and fly like a real drone pilot! Beginners can fly in Arcade or GPS mode and use keyboard or gamepad as their input method. For full immersion – and to achieve the fastest times – we recommend flying with a transmitter: we recommend this input method, especially if you want to qualify for the DCL Draft Selection, because it prepares you for flying with a real drone! COMPETE WITH THE BEST PILOTS WORLDWIDE! Compete synchronously online in Raceflow mode with pilots from around the World. Join regular online Tournaments and Special Challenges for pilots of all skill levels. Show us what you’ve got!",
