    "About the game": "Fears are not always just rustles in the dark. And death is not always a bad ending. Sometimes the acuteness of social phenomena and the bitter taste of life opens up a glance at the other side of being. It is to this topic that the ECHO short story is devoted. The theme of what remains of a person after his death. Sometimes, these are great deeds and high-profile deeds. And sometimes, it's just the memory of other people. And one more thing. The visual novel 'ECHO' is a game in which you decide for yourself what to do with the oppressive silence of difficult memories. Emotional swamps of burnt rural lives. Forgotten houses, abandoned villages. And a fluttering light of hope that everything will be fine. Enter an abandoned house with echoes of other people's lives. And get out of it if you can. The visual novel 'ECHO' was created by the project 'Baba Nyura', which collects folk mythical folklore. It was Baba Nyura who created such short stories as 'Whispers' and 'The Sin'. Many of Baba Nyura's projects were created solely on the basis of materials collected in the field. ECHO was no exception. In addition to sharp social plots and a sea of ​​suspicious sounds in the new game, perhaps the most important topic of folk mythical folklore is revealed in detail. The theme of the cult of the dead, which we are used to seeing in everyday things in front of us. The ability to make choices that affect the plot will allow players to see the ending that will be closest to them. And the most meticulous and attentive readers will even be able to find a lot of valuable information on which several generations of local historians have worked. Dedicated to all lovers of swamps, deep forests and forgotten villages.",
