    "About the game": "Emoto is a fast 3D animation tool, easy to use, fast and cost-effective, using VR devices (currently only support Htc Vive) to create character animation, and make characters in the VR to become lively and interesting, so as to quickly complete an animated film. Emoto has its own repository. You don't need any prior knowledge of 3D content creation. You just need to select the scenes and characters, play them, think about the script you want to play and complete the animated story. In addition, to make your art creation process more unique and creative, we offer free SDK tools that will support importing your own scenes, characters (with expressions, gestures, and custom actions), props and effects. Emoto not only can create 3D animation video quickly, but also has professional video production function. We divide Emoto into two modules: VR game and Editor mode. -VR game has the following functions： Using custom role actions (requiring SDK plug-ins to change character default animation) Third person role mobility Use particle effects Camera effect of DOF and FOV Stable shooting effect Fixed or free variety shooting mode.
