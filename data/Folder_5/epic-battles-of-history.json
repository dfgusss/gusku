Game Play Mechanics • Each player is represented by their chosen 'hero'. Each hero has special cards, a unique hero power and 30 health. If their health is reduced, the hero is destroyed and the controlling player loses the game. At the start of each turn, player draws a new card from their deck. During their turn, every player can play any of their cards, utilise their Hero Power, order their units to attack targets, or even have their Hero attack, if they have a weapon equipped. Most Actions require the player to spend Mana, and this constraints players to deliberately plan out their moves. Every player begins the game with 1 Mana, and increases one more toward the beginning of each turn until they arrive at the limit of 10 Mana. The majority of a player's mana recovers toward the start of their turn. Unspent Mana staying toward the finish of the turn does not carry over. The bigger Mana pools in later adjusts enable players to play progressively costly cards, opening the game up to amazing moves and stronger abilities. Strategically manoeuvre your way to victory in this highly rewarding game and relive history like never before! So what are you waiting for? Download now and battle it out in a battle of wits against the world!",
