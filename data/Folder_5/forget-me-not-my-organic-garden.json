    "About the game": "FREE update of Organic Soundtrack! We added total 20 tracks from the game including the theme song 'Forget Me Not' (The same song used in the second PV) Enjoy! Organa is an apprentice living together with shopmaster Irene on the outskirts of a quiet village. While Irene's shop is fairly small, it's always bustling with customers. Organa also helps Irene out in the shop. Organa's main duty is to grow the shop's merchandise in the greenhouse. It's a busy job: watering each item, harvesting the goods, and generally rushing all over the place. Heartily growing in the array of pots are kidneys, hearts, and such. Basically, 'organs'. Organa works hard day in and day out in order to become a master organ harvester. Today, Irene's busy shop is once again visited by some really far-out characters... Irene’s requested organ deliveries are presented as quests. By completing a few quests, more customers will come, and the story will progress. Whether it’s to get Master’s praise, or to please the customer, click away and ship those organs! Creator’s Voice 'My Organic Garden was an idea that has been floating around for a few years. Please enjoy a world where a few slightly odd organisms can exist normally.'",
