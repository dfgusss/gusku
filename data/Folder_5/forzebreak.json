Think Rocket League meets Super Smash Brothers in a Mad Max like world. But that is not all there is to it! You will have different ways available to push your opponents off the arena: ramming grills, flying boxing gloves, morning stars, grapple hooks, and more. This is the game to prove you are the ultimate fighting machine with the thrill for fast paced arena combat! ALL VS ALL ARENA COMBAT – Free for all arena combat with different items that will give you an edge over your enemies. ONLINE MULTIPLAYER – Up to 4 players can join in an online deathmatch until only one remains. 5 UNIQUE COMBAT VEHICLES – Master the 5 unique vehicles each one with its own mechanics and different stats: speed, power, energy. Try them all to find the style that best suits you and wreck your opponents!",
