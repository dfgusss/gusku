    "About the game": "Generations of Destruction is a Shoot’em Up with a twist! Pilot your drone to defeat wave after wave of enemies attacking our Solar System. Gain the upper hand through power-ups—some temporary, others permanent. Temporary power-ups are lost when your drone is destroyed. Permanent power-ups stay with your drone through each restart, meaning that death only serves to make you more powerful! What feels impossible at first becomes easy. As you play, the challenge changes from “Can I make it through alive?” to “How fast can I obliterate the enemy fleet and save the Solar System?” Each playthrough is unique and only takes a few minutes, making Generations of Destruction endlessly replayable. Features: Roguelike gameplay Randomly generated levels Simple controls – including a one-handed option Short gaming sessions",
