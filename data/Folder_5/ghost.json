    "About the game": "Ghost is a first-person horror game made in realistic 3D graphics that immerses you in an atmosphere of horror and scares you in every way. The gameplay consists of collecting notes and videotapes, solving riddles and escaping ghosts, as well as other mechanics inherent in any horror game. The main goal is to survive and be saved. Brief background: Ghosts live everywhere, in our cities and villages. These mysterious creatures walk and fly through us, and what's more scary, they can physically affect us, or even kill us! So, the hero of this game was 'lucky' to meet these unusual creatures and not only meet, but also feel in his own skin all that ghosts can be! The main character, an ordinary unremarkable guy named Klim, ended up in a rather strange abandoned place. From the very beginning, the place that Klim got into begins to catch up with negative emotions, and the more the main characters are in a strange building, the more they become convinced that he is not alone there. You have to overcome your fear, going through gloomy locations for the main character, solving various puzzles along the way and trying to understand what is happening, how you got here, and most importantly, how to get out of this place.",
