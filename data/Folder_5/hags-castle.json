    "About the game": "Hag’s Castle is a 3D Action Adventure game, inspired by classics like ‘Dungeon Master’ and ‘Eye Of The Beholder’. The game features real-time combat with a range of crusty creatures that have usurped the hallowed opulence of an ancient Scottish Castle. You, playing as a ‘Wizard’s lackey’, have been asked to perform the quest of rescuing the wizard’s pet dragon ‘Oli’ from the clutches of an evil old witch named ‘Madam Hag’. There are twenty-five levels in the game, and the player can control movement, fighting and spell-casting entirely with mouse control. It’s also the first game from Ed Sludden, a veteran Games Artist from the UK with experience working on titles such as ‘Conker’s Bad Fur Day’, ‘Bonsai Barber’ and ‘Adventure Time - Pirates of the Enchiridion’. The music in ‘Hag’s Castle’ is by Graeme Norgate, a Bafta nominated composer who has worked on video game soundtracks since the late 80’s. Graeme wrote the music on games such as Killer Instinct, Blast Corps, Goldeneye and Perfect Dark.",
