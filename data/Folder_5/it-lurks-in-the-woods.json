    "About the game": "/ It Lurks in the Woods , or Elle Rôde Dans l’Bois by its original name, is a short horror game based on French Canadian folklore. New France, 1682. A man is traveling from Ville-Marie to Trois-Rivières. The woods are a dangerous place. No one should wander in alone, but his dying brother needs its aid. On the road, as the sun settles down, something attacks him. It wasn’t an animal, or a man. It was something else. To save his brother’s life, he’ll have to find a way out before the night falls. But what lurks in the woods? It Lurks in the Woods is based on Honoré Beaugrand’s works, and the many stories that make French Canadian folklore so rich and unique.",
