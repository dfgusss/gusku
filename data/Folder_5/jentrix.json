    "About the game": "Meet Jentrix! This game was inspired by the famous board game and combines the very best of Jenga, match-3 and Tetris. And it’s all packed in Virtual Reality! We are pretty sure you know the classic Jenga, but what if instead of wooden blocks there would be colorful fruit cubes, the towers would grow every second, and crocodiles would try to bite your hands? Jentrix mixes different sets of mechanics from everyone’s favorite games. Jenga provides its well-known look of the tower and tests your physical and mental skills. Match-3 brings its popular 3-in-a-row portion, while Tetris vibes will put you to the edge as the tower grows. The game has 4 modes: Company with 40+ levels on different locations, Arcade with endless gameplay and leaderboards, Table Top with mini Jenga that you can enjoy while sitting, and Multiplayer to play with your friends or random opponents. Key features REALISTIC PHYSICS Interact with the fruits how you want: from throwing them at flying penguins to juggling! FOUR MODES Arcade — endless gameplay and leaderboards! Company — 40+ levels and 14 various locations! Table Top — if you’re tired, sit and relax with mini Jenga! Multiplayer — bring your friends to the party or challenge random people all over the world! RELAXING EXPERIENCE Relax, reflect, unwind! UNIQUE GAMEPLAY It’s Jenga you’ve never seen before!",
