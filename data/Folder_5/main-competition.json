    "About the game": "An old-school point-and-click sci-fi mystery adventure game set in a futuristic building. Something happened at the Laboratory. The communication has been cut off. No-one leaves the building and all signs of life inside disappeared. You have been sent inside to investigate the situation. Can you *save* the scientists? This is a short adventure game based on an exploration of a deserted scientific research facility. You try to solve the mystery of vanished scientists, searching the rooms, inspecting found objects and finally making consequential decisions. Nothing really is what it seems to be. Including you… Featuring the original soundtrack created by Liz Katrin!",
