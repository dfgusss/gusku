    "About the game": "ULTIMATE LOCAL MULTIPLAYER RETROGAMING ARCADE Basically Manic Archers is still in Early Access, just classified it wrong and Steam does not allow to change back. WHY YOU SHOULD GET MANIC ARCHERS NOW Manic Archers is the first topdown Zelda-type versus game ever ! And it is almost for free while still in Early Access (official release planned late 2022/early 2023). On-the-point gameplay and simple yet deep mechanics First rpg-style top down versus fighting game Lovely, hand-animated pixelart, inspired by the golden age of 2d arcade games AI support and coop-survival mode also without your friends Atmospheric music and sound-effects Interactive levels Many common multiplayer modes Highly strategic matches vs. complete infernos Authentic classic RPG-scale sprites and environment expanded to HD resolution GAMEPLAY FIRST MANIC ARCHERS is an atmospheric and extremely addictive local and online multiplayer arcade game in pixelart-style. It features simplistic and on-the-point gameplay with amazing game mechanics and lovely pixelart-details. It is playable with up to 4 players simultaneously on one screen in several variants. 3 buttons is all you need to know - jump, shoot and dash/block . The depth of good gameplay is found in simplicity accompanied by great mechanics . THINK ZELDA AND DEATHMATCH With the intention to make a multiplayer match top-down game, MANIC ARCHERS owes to and actually should remind of the heritage of all top-down games like the Zelda and Final Fantasy series. Imagine the same love for details put into a competitive multiplayer arcade game for 4 players simultaneously. APPROVED MULTIPLAYER FUN In versus-mode players each control an archer, shooting the opposing archers until only one archer is left - besides Free-For-All versus, Manic Archers is featuring several other well known multiplayer modes . During the game a lot of combinable and game changing powerups and special arrows appear on the playing field, enabling players to turn the game around in an instant. AI TO KEEP YOU GAMING In case you need one more player to start a 2on2 teamplay match or if you are alone and want to train, Manic Archers got AI opponents to fill up the slots . RETRO CAUSE WE DO NOT NEED 3D FOR THAT The game takes place on a single screen with classic arcade wrap-around scrolling .
