    "About the game": "Mech Arena is an arcade shooter set in an arena, where the goal is to score as many points as possible. The player plays as a Mech, equipped with 2 weapons and a utility tool, and must survive a total of 6 successive rounds within the arena, while trying to score as many points as possible. With each new round, the enemies encountered are more and more numerous and powerful, and the arena evolves as well, becoming larger and more difficult to exploit. But more danger means more points! In this game, the player has the possibility to adapt his choices in order to optimize his strategy to score points. The evolving capabilities of the arena and the mecha's upgrades, unlockable at the end of each round, allow him to define his own gameplay.",
