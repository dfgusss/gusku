Player: 'I'm sorry WHAT!?' Fina: Wait, that came out wrong.. I meant to say, I am sorry to inform you of your death. Player: 'Oh, gee... thanks..' Fina: Anyway's, I am Fina. I am in charge of your reincarnation. Since you lived a good life, you've been given the option to choose your after life! Player: 'I spent my whole life playing video games and watching cartoons, you call that a good life?' Fina: Well, you spent so much time being a loser, that you didn't have any time to kill or steal. Player: 'That's weird, it almost sounded like you called me a loser just now.' Fina: Now then. What's it going to be NEET, perhaps you want to save a world from peril, or become a powerful king! Player: 'I want to come back with you and live amongst all the other beautiful goddesses!' Fina: W-what!!",
