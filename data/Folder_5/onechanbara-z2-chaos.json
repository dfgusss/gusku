    "About the game": "Kagura and Saaya are schoolgirl sisters raised together by the Vampiric Clan, and rank among their strongest warriors. Aya and Saki are assassin sisters descended from the rival Baneful Bloodline, and represent their lineage with esteem. Now, these four must learn to fight together against an undead army. Brought under one banner known as the “Zombie Punitive Force,” these blood enemies will have to reach a mutual understanding in order to save the world as we know it. And as long as they’re working together, they might as well do it in style… Onechanbara Z2: Chaos is the latest entry in the Onechanbara series. The Vampiric sisters and two legendary zombie-hunting sisters of Baneful blood battle through over a dozen stages of high-octane real-time swordplay. Fight off the invasion in gruesome detail, occasionally transforming into a demon for short bursts of added power and speed. Enjoy the gameplay experience with the original Japanese voices or – for the first time in series history – a full English dub. --Web------------------- /#top --SNS------------------- --YOUTUBE-------------------",
