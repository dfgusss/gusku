    "Release date": "Jun 4, 2021",
    "About the game": "It's 2123 and robots have invaded the Earth. Humanity has been forced to evacuate the planet in search of a new home out in space. An organization called Invasion Force (I.F.) has assembled to investigate the cause and find any means of reclaiming the planet. Enter Ark, a young member of I.F. who's been tasked with fighting off the robots/automata on Earth, as well as reconnaissance duties. But his recurring eerie dreams as of late speak a mystery he is determined to pursue no matter what in hopes of finding answers to his long lost past... This game (will/already) feature(s): - Bullet hell elements, toned down (made easier) for the general public + a unique bullet hell concept to make the game a little more interesting. - Random generation (RNG). Tons of it. For this game, it means: A hidden, randomly generated mystery (yes, randomly generated). An infinite number of bosses. Certain enemies (including bosses) are randomly generated, meaning they may have different weapon attachments, phases, and even behaviors. Levels are randomly generated, as is the world map (which of course extends to different types of enemies, items, etc.) Randomly generated dialogue options for the player to choose from. A chat feature with infinite dialogue possibilities where the player can talk to the characters. This has been implemented at a basic form, but is not included in Early Access. - An immersive plot - 3+ lovable characters (with depth of personality). ** If you are prone to epileptic seizures or anything of the sort when playing games with flashing lights/screens, I would advise you not to play this game. ** There are some horror elements, but they are 'polite' (no instant jumpscares with loud noises).",
