    "Name": "Orb Labs, Inc.",
    "Release date": "Jun 11, 2018",
    "About the game": "You follow a message from an unknown contact to the secret underground lab of Orb Labs to find evidence of 'questionable experiments' conducted there. However, you soon have to discover that the whole complex is protected by deadly laser systems that will try to kill any intruder. Luckily for you, you can use Orb Labs' own weapons against them: orbs . Sneak through the lab, avoid being seen (well, and shot at), and descend all the way to discover the truth! Features 5+ hours of gameplay in story mode, sneaking your way through ever new and challenging parts of the lab Maneuver through dangerous situations, each of which can be solved in different ways (and using different orbs!) Cybersickness-free movement: throw orbs to teleport around dangerous situations Find the best way to beat each level and compete against the world in challenge mode! Note: HTC Vive recommended. Oculus Rift (S) (with Touch controllers, and 360° room-scale tracking strongly recommended) is supported via SteamVR. The game is compatible with the Valve Index, but has not been optimized for it, and does not make use of the special capabilities of the Valve Index Controllers (yet). We're working on that! Orb Labs, Inc. cannot be played with Windows Mixed Reality headsets, as hand tracking is not reliable enough.",
