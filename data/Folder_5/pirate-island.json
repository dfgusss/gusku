    "About the game": "The sea is always full of dangerous surprises, and the story of our hero only confirms this. The veteran retired privateer, returning from his honeymoon with his wife, was caught in a violent storm, in connection with which he was forced to land on a lonely island to replenish supplies. But later it turns out that the island is not uninhabited, but full of greedy and evil pirates, who first of all kidnapped the wife of our hero and demand a ransom for her! But he is not as simple as it seems at first glance, and he does not have so much gold, so the only way out is to win back the kidnapped wife! Pirat Island is a 3D side-scrolling shooter with platformer elements in which you have to start hunting the evil pirates and soulless skeletons that have come to life due to the magic of Voodoo! Your task is very difficult - to clear a huge island from all the bad guys, having only a stump of a saber and a musket in your bosom. Collect coins and bullets, find new equipment and replay the pirate rabble on the brutal battlefield in an unequal battle where everyone is against you alone. Do everything in your power to save your beloved, and quickly leave this terrible place! Game features: - Nice graphics - Dynamic gameplay - 2 story comics - High difficulty",
