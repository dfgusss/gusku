    "About the game": "Your favorite pictures were shredded accidentally. Fortunately you have all the pieces, and you can restore them. Just drag the rows of the picture and they will glued if you release them so, that they fit together. This way more and more parts of the picture can be restored until you get the original picture. During your work you can zoom in the picture so that you can see how the pixels in the adjacent row fit. If you think the task is too hard, you can play 7 difficulty level. The 1st one is pretty easy, and the 7th is really hard, sometimes nearly impossible. You can also check the original picture by clicking the hint button, but that costs points and actually it is more fun to restore the whole picture without help. You have 100 pictures to restore, and each picture has its high score. Relaxing and funny, do you need more?",
