    "About the game": "PLANET LEV MATADERO is an artistic, immersive experience created by Children of Cyberspace and produced by Matadero Madrid and L.E.V. Festival. Available both in virtual reality and for web browsers, this dream-like digital universe is filled with animated sculptures and sound installations by artists all over the world: from massive moving structures that can be explored from every angle, to interactive artworks and portals to other digital worlds. It also hosts live shows and audiovisual performances, acting as a real-time immersive stage for LEV online events. The virtual scenery has been inspired by Asturian landscape, home of LEV Festival, and its dominant species are the Nimis, sentient beings that are the most renowned collectors in cyberspace. Their love for arts has made them dedicate their whole planet to the beauty of creative expression. Enter PLANET LEV to fly over its massive cliffs, lose yourself in the canyons, go inside its caves, discover astonishing artistic installations in every corner and interact with its fauna and flora. When you decide to end your journey, don't forget to stop by the desert to leave your trace and plant a tree that will stay until the last cycle of the planet.",
