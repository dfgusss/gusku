    "About the game": "The only game that brings you closer and pushes you apart! Join the wackiest family in the universe, and prove your oh-so-important point by pushing each other around. Or, you know, 'work together' like only a family can. Push Your Family is a multiplayer party game with wacky physics, it can be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike! Even your mom can join in. So pick up a controller and play one of the many game modes, no tutorial needed! Pickup &amp; Play One joystick to move, one button to push (your family). So easy to learn that anyone can join in! Just hand over a controller. Master Your Movement We made sure you can do a whole lot with those simple controls though! Rumor has it pro gamers can jump further, kick people, or even impress others with a backflip! Outsmart Your Friends Each interactive battleground is packed with things that bring an untimely end to you or a (pushed) family member. Explore and strategize! Or simply push your family members where they don't belong! We want to bring a diverse and growing selection of trips and modes to the world of Push Your Family. Battle Be the last family member to survive by pushing your loved ones into rollercoasters, waves of vengeful pinguïns, malfunctioning rockets, you know- the unusual! Unique Modes Our latest is 'Quarantine'. Where you and the fam are stuck in a house, locked in by the S Y S T E M. to get out, you’ll have to make your way to the Disinfector 9000™ and get cleared by a treacherous camera at the front door. As you already know, quarantining with family can get messy! Only one family member will make it to the outside world, let's hope it's you! Clasic Modes Modes that almost everybody already knows. Our newest classic mode is Capture The Flag, in which teams fight to protect their flag and nation while stealing the flags and cultures from the others. Take Control and Expiriment (coming soon) Use 'Special Settings' to experience things like moon-like gravity, big heads, hulk-like strength! Or.. huge arms!? Dress to Impress Unlock outfits and hats to look your best (or worst, idk, we don't judge!) Future Content For future content, we've got our roadmap, but honestly, we'll really be listening to the community for more tasty goodness! More modes? Co-op campaign? HECK YEAH! We want what you want! Join the family on Discord, your mom's already there! Thanks for making it this far! Here is a dog: Made Possible By:",
