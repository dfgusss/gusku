    "About the game": "QUICKERFLAK is an experimental fast-paced time-attack top-down combat retro-hardcore minigame, made by Walter Machado, the developer of the arcade series UBERMOSH. Procedural elements go from the level geometry thru music, mixing industrial and organic art styles. 'What you see is what you get' the trailer is raw gameplay footage from start to the boss. 'How quick can it be?' The player starts with an overpowered weapon (like all enemies) and has less than 90 seconds to beat all nodes. No upgrades, no fillers, no grinding, an arcade minigame experience that can be finished in a minute.",
