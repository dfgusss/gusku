You'll experience what it's like to have nightmarish diarrhea that's so intense that it'll serve as your engine and help you overcome gravity. Your goal is to defile every corner in all levels with your feces. Beware of the janitors who will try to clean your lovingly mucked up areas. Also, lots of traps and enemies will make your life difficult and try to prevent you from making the perfect mess. Key Features: * Navigate skillfully through 2D levels, full of traps and nasties. * 4 different themes with a total of 60 virgin levels just waiting to receive your manure. * Defeat bosses and master the Hardmode.",
