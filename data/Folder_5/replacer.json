    "About the game": "- Genre - A 2D action game. It might be better to call it Metroidvania. It's an action game where you switch between multiple special guns that swap things around and aim to step through the stages. Straight Line Shot Move in a straight line and swap the position of the object and the player. Parabolic Shot Moves in a parabolic line, strongly affected by gravity, and swaps the position of the object and the player. Bounce Shot Bounces off a wall, swapping the position of the object and the player. Reposition Shot Allows the player to change the position of an object. Swap Positions Shot Allows you to swap the positions of two objects. Special Jump Allows you to jump once in the air after swapping places with an object. Floating Holding down the jump key while in the air will cause you to fall gently. The basic mechanism is that touching the four colored key triggers will release the closed routes. The game is designed to traverse dungeons by using the special actions described above. As a casual game, it is designed to take about an hour per play. A good way to play might be to aim for first place in the nation in the time attack ranking. - Story - What awaits you inside the mysterious structure that towers over a corner of the universe? The story begins when you touch a glowing body drifting on the surface of the earth. - Operation - You can use the mouse wheel QE 12345 to switch weapons.",
