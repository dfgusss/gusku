Game graphical design is retro and it is evolving all the time. New features and content will be added to the game at regular intervals. The game uses OpenGL, a revolutionary option to DirectX since year 1991, was originally developed by Silicon Graphics. Thanks to OpenGL Highly Optimized Code, this game will run on just about any graphics card produced in 2004 and later, so you don't need to worry much about what graphic card do you have.

All characters and locations used in this game are fictitious. Any resemblance to real persons, vehicles and places is purely coincidental.
