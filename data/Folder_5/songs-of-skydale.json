The game starts with a classic adventure game opening when a player arrives at the Kingdom of Skydale with the hope of a new beginning for his life. Straight away, the player gets involved in various events and quests in the Kingdom of Skydale. As the game progress, the player faces different characters, items, enemies, dungeons and even some puzzles! Songs of Skydale is a game by a player for players. The idea of the game is to give players a sense of adventure without too much hand-holding, so be prepared! When adventuring through the lands of Skydale, players must navigate using paper maps and information provided by the quest givers. If players enter uninhabited areas, they must be ready to fight against various enemies and survive until they can reach the next safe area. The game offers fast-paced hack-and-slash style combat, which is strongly based on player skill. Correctly timed attacks, blocks and dodges are the keys to success. Combat is supported by skills and items designed to have very little restrictions. There are no classes in the game—players can choose skills freely from 19 different options.
