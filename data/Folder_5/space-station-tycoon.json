    "About the game": "It’s the year 3000AD. Humanity has spread its reach across the stars, created a booming economy, and now seeks entrepreneurial spirits to stake their claims. Come all you tycoons, for now, is the time to take action and build your own space station. It won’t be easy, you’ll have to fight off space pirates, attract demanding customers to your services, and risk financial ruin on the markets. But if it was easy, why, wouldn’t everyone do it? All sorts of pilots wander the galaxy and it's up to you to figure out what will bring you the most success. Each pilot has their own priorities and needs; ranging from refueling their ships, satisfying their desire for alcohol, or gambling away their hard-earned cash. Even though what they each look for in a space station is very different, there is one thing they have in common; they want to spend some money. But where there’s profit, there are always risks to consider. Pirates are around every corner looking for a score. Markets will fluctuate and potentially bankrupt your efforts as the demands of pilots change. Meanwhile, something mysterious lurks in the shadow, waiting for the right time to strike. In Space Station Tycoon you will expand your station by building lots of different stuff like docking bays, research facilities, and even casinos to attract every kind of customer you can. Spread your influence among the stars and create the kind of station you would be proud to call your own. Space Station Tycoon is inspired by its greatest ancestors of the “tycoon” genre. We took those inspirations and wanted to create our own tycoon game set in a sci-fi universe. Where the player has a chance to experience the demands of running their own station. Our main goal is to ensure that strategic depth and difficult choices are at the forefront of everything you do. The final version of Space Station Tycoon will offer many days of fun gameplay. Here's an overview of what we have added to the early-access release so far: Over 35+ unique buildings to build, upgrade, and manage. Serve a vast variety of customers ranging from mean space pirates to clan merchants who get easily upset at your fuel prices. Customize your station and show your style for the whole galaxy to see. Monitor the volatile stock market and ride the edge between vast riches and agonizing debt. Research alien artifacts and unlock amazing new tech. Buy and sell precious materials and turn a profit. Send out your drones on dangerous space missions to gather rare artifacts. Try to survive many hostile events like natural disasters or pirate attacks. Use the really in-depth finance tab to maximize your profits. Plan strategic marketing moves to increase the popularity of your station. Build holographic billboards and display ads from the corporations you work with. Time speed controls. A 5-star ranking system to determine your station's quality. Achievements. Original soundtrack. Frequent content updates. ...and lots more to come.",
