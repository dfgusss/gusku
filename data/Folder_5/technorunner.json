    "About the game": "TechnoRunner is an indie Arcade game, mixing Rythm game and Endless Runner, set in procedurally generated levels. Compete on a global leaderboard or against your friends for the highest score! The music sets the pace! Move in the rythm, and take as many risks as possible to unlock combo chains. The walls are procedurally generated using a complex APM tuning algorithm. Can you reach the end of a song? The game was carefully crafted by a solo indie developer. And he hopes you like it!",
