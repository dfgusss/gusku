Play some Tennis ! The game also features a full 3D match engine, which lets you play tennis as you want in the Training Club. In addition, you can optionally take the control of your player during the tournament 3D matches. A little warning though: the management part will get a bit unbalanced from this, as some skills will be of lesser importance when you play all by yourself. The match engine is based on the Tennis Elbow 2013 one, already acclaimed by many players as the most realistic tennis game, but with a new &amp; improved physics for the ball, court, strikes &amp; players ! The AI is also greatly improved, with new player strategies and more realistic behaviors.
