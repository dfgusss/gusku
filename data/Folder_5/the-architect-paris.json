    "About the game": "The Architect: Paris (TA:P) is a construction game. Turn the capital of France into a medieval looking city or a futuristic one, build a business district surrounded by parks, create gigantic plazas worthy of the greatest soviet cities, imagine neighborhoods where historical architecture blends in with the most modern designs… Draw your own buildings with an accuracy never seen before. The powerful brick-to-building system developed by Enodo Games will give you complete control over your projects. Destroy. Draw. Build. And then, start over as many times as you wish. Lastly, admire your work, choosing weather and lighting conditions that highlight your new city. Share your creations with players around the world through videos and pictures. City View First and foremost, enjoy the view! Each street, building, monument that makes this city what it is will be replicated in great detail. This living environment will be the backdrop for your creations. Change the time of day and weather conditions to visualize all your projects. Strategic map Which district will you choose as the stepping stone for your architectural journey? Which district will you erase from the map to make way for a massive park? What will be your next playground? The Strategic map is where you will find answers to these questions. It is where you will gather information regarding Main Projects as well as Landmarks of each district. Drawing Board. The true heart of the game, where you will spend most your game time. Pick a Design, apply it to a plot, customize the height of the building and the punctuation of the facade, change the roof shape, the materials, modify the lighting conditions in real time to make sure you are happy with your project and confirm your choices to finally see it in the City View. Plot Editor Let’s take it up a notch. When using existing plots that Paris provides is no longer enough for you, when you want to completely and profoundly redesign and reshape each district, you might just find what you need in the Plot Editor. You will be able to erase or merge existing plots of a block, even redesign them entirely if you so wish. Powerful but easy to use, the Plot Editor will let your imagination roam free and give life to your wildest fantasies.",
