Jake is trapped looking for his daughter who was kidnapped by a misterious shadow. Explore a mysterious world populated with intrigues, challenges, and an epic story. We decide to join the two parts in which you divide the game into one for a greater gaming experience. Travel through an exciting story of terror and suspense.
