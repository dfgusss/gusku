    "About the game": "Trial of the Gods is a collectible card game based in the world of Siralim. Collect creature cards with unique traits and use them to battle against the gods. Features 100+ cards to collect that are based on creatures from the Siralim series! Each card has a unique trait that changes the way it works in battle. Full-length campaign featuring over 90 battles, along with a hard mode. Post-game content that features randomly generated battles. Win these matches to empower your cards and make them stronger! Matches take only a few minutes to complete, lending the game a 'just one more round' style of play. Gameplay is based on Triple Triad and Tetra Master from Final Fantasy. Travel the 15 realms of Rodia and challenge the gods! Each realm consists of 6 battles. You will be rewarded with new cards and experience points for winning these battles, allowing you to experiment with new deck compositions to ensure your victory. Each card has unique stats and a trait that changes the way they work in battle. Use the Skeleton to snipe your foes from afar, or utilize a kamikaze-style attack with the Apis. The possibilities are endless! Siralim games are known for their insane amount of post-game content, and Trial of the Gods is no different! After you finish the campaign, you'll unlock a Hard Mode that is sure to challenge even the best of players. In addition, you will gain access to the Itherian Realms - randomly generated battles that allow you to empower your cards if you win, giving them increased stats.",
