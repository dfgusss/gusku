    "About the game": "About the game: Vecitas is a fast paced multiplayer space shooter combined with singleplayer inspired by retro twin stick shooters. Have fun playing with other players in space combat. Unlock new ships by being the best in multiplayer as well as singleplayer. Singleplayer: Your pilot will have to fight in the singleplayer mode to get new ships through the Galaxy of Vecitas. Enter the singleplayer mode hunting the enemy ships to get their ships as skins. These skins can be used in multiplayer with other players. Multiplayer: The premise of the game is simple, engage in deep space multiplayer combat. Destroy your enemies to get experience points and unlock eight possible spaceship upgrades. Collect energy charges and obtain a larger plasma reserve. Shoot the other players and store experience points to unlock the next upgrade. Each spaceship tier will give you a new powerful weapon with its own independent values like power, cost, cool down and reach. If you are in trouble, you could use the spaceship extra tools (Shield and Turbo) and get through dangerous situations. Activating them will consume a part of your plasma reserve but will help you protect your valuable experience points. If you prove that you are an expert pilot, your spaceship will upgrade to golden armor.",
