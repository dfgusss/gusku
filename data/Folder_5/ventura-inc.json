    "About the game": "Ventura Inc is an economic simulation in a consistent multiplayer world. (MMO) As a player you'll be running a company, signing contracts with other players involving the exchange of goods and services. In this simulation, you are, just like in the real world, doing business with other player companies to make your profit. It is possible to choose who you deal with and who's pricing you'll try to undercut. There are different business branches available from where you can make your money: Oil Refinery Transportation Storage Farming Banking Power Plants ... Key to avoiding bankruptcy is making sure you run your business more cheaply than that of your opponents. (Signing better deals) Most of the branches need other branches to function. As an example: to generate power you have to rely on storage as well as oil transported to your power plant. Someone will also need to build your power plant for you (someone with a construction branch). Ventura Inc wants to bring you a game in wich you can play with your friends , work in team, communicate, trade and get rich.",
