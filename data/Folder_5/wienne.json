    "About the game": "Wienne is a short story-driven RPG, in which you are tasked to save Wienne and Zack from a nearly inevitable demise. You can do it. The game features a unique branching system, which allows you to affect the flow of the story at any point in time - and not only during specific choice moments. Wienne features a lore-rich world, handcrafted pixel graphics, and a peaceful soundtrack. So, find her path. Build it step by step, learn the consequences of your actions and go beyond what you imagined was possible... Then, and only then, you might stand a chance of making it out alive. Take that as a challenge. '- ...no, not Myrth Mountain. Not if we can avoid it. - Can we, though? - I would give you specific instructions if I could. You know that. - My apologies. For how long am I to keep her hidden? - I... I'd rather not say. Just keep her safe until it's all over. And after that - bring her here. - As you wish. - Good. Now, go. - Farewell, Lady. It has been a honor. - Take care of her for me, Jacob. Farewell.'",
