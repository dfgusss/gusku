Please expect 'Zombie Soldier' to be a small, re-playable, metroidvania style throwback to the early days of Nintendo and Sega Genesis/Megadrive 16Bit style games. 1. Easy to learn classic A+B button controls. 2. Play with Gamepad or Keyboard + Mouse. 3. Controller support for that retro gameplay feel. 4. A retro and modern graphics mashup. 5. Simple yet challenging arcade and 80's home console throwback styled game. Kill or be killed and fight hard to pass each challenging level. Different paths can be taken and the levels get harder as you progress. Shoot, jump and kill to survive while collecting blood viles to escape permadeath in each level.",
