    "About the game": "THE ULTIMATE SPACE COMBAT SIMULATION Paying homage to classic side-scrolling shooters, “2076: Midway Multiverse” offers the ultimate space combat simulation experience. Take command of your starship and fight waves of enemies that will -literally- attack you from every possible angle. Get the most out of your Virtual Reality device and explore the remotest sites of the multiverse as you try to free the galaxy from the tyranny of the Nazi Galactic Empire. THE STORY After the events that took place in '1976: Back to Midway', we find ourselves trapped in the year 2021 along with Dr. Ivanovich inside the Quantum Simulator. When it seems that we’re condemned to spend the rest of our days there, Dr. Novichiva -an alternative version of Dr. Ivanovich- shows up through a space-time breach, holding us responsible for the greatest threat the multiverse has ever faced. Our constant back and forth through space-time has altered the infinite parallel realities, whose very existence we ignored. As a consequence, in a high percentage of these multiverses, Hitler not only won World War II, but has ended up expanding his power to the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The allied resistance in universe C-139, commanded by dr. Novichiva, has managed to eliminate thousands of versions of Hitler in their respective multiverses, but some of them are still on the warpath. FEATURES 13 story-mode levels filled with humor. Manipulate the environment: Hit, grab, move, shoot, ... Everything is possible in the multiverse. 3 levels of difficulty: To satisfy the most casual player as well as those looking for a real challenge. 18 immersion zones. 100 missions. More than 200 aircraft upgrades. Tons of action; enjoy infinite retries. Compatible with Vive, Oculus, and WMR. Compatible with motion simulators. Dr. Novichiva needs our help. The entire multiverse needs our help. Will you be able to defeat the Nazis once again and restore peace to the infinite quantum realities? There’s only one way to find out...",
