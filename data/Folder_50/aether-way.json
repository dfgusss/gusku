You'll need to find your star system, secure its borders and defeat enemies, additionally developing the economy, exploring the space and completing missions. The game focuses on continuous battles and territory expansion, alternating strategic actions with action mode, in which you control a single unit and do various tasks from resources mining to supporting your forces in battles.
