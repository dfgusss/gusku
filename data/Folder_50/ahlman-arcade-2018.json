    "About the game": "Ahlman Arcade 2018 is a collection of games made by the game industry students at Ahlman Institute. All games were made during our ten month long school year as a joint effort between the programmers and graphic designers. The time spent developing each game varied, with some being made in a week or so and others taking over ten weeks to develop. Our games have a diverse selection of different genres, ranging from colorful platformers and collect-a-thons to sport games, horror mysteries, racing games and bullet hell manias. They can be found on the consoles and cabinets scattered about inside the Ahlman Arcade itself, so try to find and play them all! In the Ahlman Arcade you can… Behold the Main Project Room , where we’ve placed our most valued and treasured game projects Take in the nostalgia in the Gamer Room or the Arcade Hall , and play games on old-school consoles and cabinets Visit the Museum of Graphics , and have a look at the artwork our graphic designers have made Find the hidden basement , and see what horrors await within… [/list] In the Main Project Room you can… Race against the clock or your friends in Deadline ( local split-screen multiplayer only ) Look out for birds and boulders in the 3D bullet hell adventure Dragon’s Fodder Delve deep into the gruesome horror story of Going Home … In the Gamer Room you can… Help Doctor Nestor save or destroy the last of animal-kind in the post-apocalyptic world of Dr. Nestor’s Ark Enjoy a baseball-themed, classic 2D platformer with BallCat’s Homerun Jump on leaves and stars, and see how high you can go in Corgi Jumper Collect all the berries in the low-poly scenery of Fox’s Berry Adventure Escape your fate as a child’s toy and sneak around the patrolling robots in Ungifted Bunny In the Arcade Hall you can… Have a Disc Golf Experience unlike ever before ( VR version published separately ) Join the grumpy Mr. Potato in the quest to save your spuds in Mr. Potato Runner Play a nerve-wracking game of cat-and-mouse in the bullet hell mania Top Hat Cat Avoid barrels, trees, tables and bears as you run in Ms Woman Runner Test your dodging skills in the spooky bullet hell Shadow Glider Thanks to our mentor Risto Koskenkorva , who helped us in everything (programming, implementation, bug fixing, Blender and so forth) and Jani Rajahalme , who carried Ahlman Arcade 2018 to the end.
