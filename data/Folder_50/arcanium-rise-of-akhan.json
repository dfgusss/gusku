    "About the game": "INTRODUCTION Merging the best of Roguelike and Deckbuilding, Arcanium is an epic, ambitious, open-world single-player strategy game. Form a party of three Heroes and embark on a dangerous journey in order to defeat Akhan the Calamity, and save the world of Arzu from destruction. THE ROADMAP! OPEN WORLD PROGRESSION, PLAY YOUR WAY! Roam freely inside a vast, fully procedural 3D map, but keep an eye on the Threat meter... The longer you stay in a Province, the harder the enemies get. Forge a path wisely, the choices you make have a lasting impact on the rest of your Run. UNIQUE TURN-BASED COMBAT Strategize your attack on every turn, coordinating unique skills between all three heroes in your team. Our innovative combat system is easy to learn while offering tremendous strategic depth PARTY OF THREE Control a party of three Heroes on the battlefield, each with their own skills (and ultimate abilities), equipment, and upgrades. Swap heroes in battle, allowing the healthier heroes to step in front of the incoming damage and protect your more fragile party members. HERO UNLOCKS Many unique heroes with varying mechanics and themes to keep you brainstorming for new compositions and combinations. Each has a unique starting deck of Ability cards that fits one of 6 classes. Triple-supports? All ranged Abilities? Damage-over-time heavy? Anything goes! Find the play-style that works for you. RPG-STYLE LOOTING Find powerful artifacts, gain new skills from cards, learn cross-character abilities, and discover consumable items throughout your journeys. You can edit your Heroes' ability decks and equipment rosters at any time outside of combat. SUPPORT SMALL DEVS! Arcanium: Rise of Akhan is the lovechild of SUPERCOMBO, we're a small team of just four passionate developers who have, since 2017, lived and breathed card strategy. We are Remi Marchand (CEO, Lead Designer &amp; Game director), Josh Kohlmeier (Technical director &amp; Lead developer), Jacob Rommann (Senior developer) and Jaslynn Tham (Art Director). Our mission is to surprise and delight players with a unique, innovative, and beautiful experience, so we hope you’ll continue to join us as we take Arcanium to the next level.",
