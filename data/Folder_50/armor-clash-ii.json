Story Line: In 2035, the Artificial Intelligence technology got a qualitative leap. Top scientists of the world completed the most ambitious project of human being, the Global Artificial Intelligence Assembly, known as 'Gaia'. Gaia is build on the cloud. She connects all devices from cell phones on the hand to satellites in the space. Gaia collects all information, from which kind of hamburger you like last week, to all the stock deals in past 10 years, then analyses the mass data by assembling computing resources all over the world, and finally calculate the 'ultimate solution' for every human being. For the common people, Gaia will tell he or she what to do for every minute, to eat which food or read which article. It is not an order, but people always find that by following Gaia's suggestion it always benefits most. For the army, Gaia play as the commander, she can calculate the best move for each soldier on the field at the same time, and finally lead them to victory, without anyone wounded. Not like in Hollywood movies, Gaia did not build Skynet to eliminate human, or build her drone army to conquer the world. Followed by the first principle in her source code, 'Help but not replace human', Gaia served human well. But the real conflict come from human them self: Many people realized that because of Gaia, human do not think any more, and finally abandoned their freedom. At the beginning, it is just some kind of idealism, but when AI let more and more people lose their job, it became rebellion. Most of them are elites in the past, but become useless when Ai came: No fund manager is useless because AI always give the best financing solution; Gaia can command soldiers directly through the holo-glass, so officers are not needed. Even the scientists who make Gaia are not escaped, a scientific AI study matrix can do all the life-time work of a professor, but only in an hour. Finally, those elites in the past decided to fight against Gaia, but soon they found all devices and weapons are controlled by Gaia. Cameras and drones spreads everywhere in cities, human forces even had no place to hide. So they banished themselves to abandoned industrial cities, they rebuild factories, using the technologies of 80s, which seems to be out dated but Gaia can not connect to. They re-active tanks and attack helicopters in the steel cemetery, rebuild battleships of WW2, some report said that they even rebuild the space shuttle platform. At last, they build up a settlement and their armies, without Gaia's control, they called themselves 'Steel Alliance'. Now, the war between Gaia and Steel Alliance is inevitable, no matter which side you are, good luck, commander:)",
