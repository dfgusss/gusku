I've added a lot of love in making this game, so I hope you enjoy it as much as I did in creating it! Expect a simple yet very polished arcade game where you constantly beat your previous score, earn coins, and unlock new characters. I'd love to get in touch with BlamBox players, so please contact me through Twitter or my website if there is something wrong with the game, or you just want to say hi and talk about games! A.J. Hecali - Heavenward Games Shoot as many boxes as you can through the goals, and don't let them fall! Red boxes should go through the red goal, blue to blue, and yellow to yellow! It gets more challenging as you get better at the game. Have fun and keep BLAM -ming those BOX es! Left mouse button - Bounce up the boxes Right mouse button - Shoot them through the goals Easy to learn, mouse controls. Just two buttons to play! Unique arcade game that's simple to learn, but hard to master! Endless waves of boxes that pushes your aiming skills to the limit, and takes you into a state of flow Unlock 7 characters to use (cosmetics only) Steam Achievements and Leaderboards! Trading cards are on their way! Steam Cloud Save Support Perfect for quick rounds of fun gameplay while you wait for your AAA game to download ;) Translated into 8 different languages",
