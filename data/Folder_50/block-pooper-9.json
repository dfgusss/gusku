    "About the game": "'Is it true?' she whispered breathlessly. 'Do they poop......blocks?' 'Yes.' I replied, firm and comforting. 'They poop blocks.' 'How many blo...' I cut her off. 'So many blocks.' Her voice was choked with emotion. She'd never dared to dream.... 'And...it has local multi-player, with competitive tournament action? How many players?' 'At least 6. More if you can figure out how to plug them all in. XBOX, PS4, Wiimotes. Everything I could find.' Electrostatic energy crackled between us as I explained that it was a party game. Players control heads that fly around like rockets, competing to collect falling points and collaborating to keep the heart from being eaten. Her jaw trembled when I told her it offered intense, physics based action, where your best defense was to excrete blocks on all those beneath you. She was silent, but I knew her thoughts rushed like the hot blood in our veins. 'I.....I love you' she whispered. Her eyes wet. Hands trembling. As the years passed, our love would be tested, but always came out square in the end.",
