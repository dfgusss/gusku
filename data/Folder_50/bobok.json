    "About the game": "'Bobok' is a kinetic visual novel based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's short story of the same name. 1873. St. Petersburg. Not the most prominent literary man was dubbed in newspapers as a madman. His portrait with two phenomenally symmetrical and lively warts was to blame! Unheard of human stupidity surrounds the writer. Wishing to divert himself, he enters a funeral where he begins to hear the voices of undead people... Maybe at least they are smarter than living ones? Unknown Dostoevsky One of the most atypical and wierdest works of the great Russian writer Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (author of Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov). Black humor, satire, grotesque, and a cross-section of the author's entire oeuvre fit into a short story where fantastic madness goes hand in hand with documented reality. The game is great for those who want to experience the original text. Glossary The handy hint system prevents you from being confused by terms and easily fills in the missing knowledge. It is more convenient and informative than footnotes in books. Localization Workshop Can't find your language?
