    "About the game": "A note from the developer If you ever liked the fast pace and difficulty of old school shooters from the 90s, you should give Boom Stick a try. Boom Stick takes the Classic Gameplay and boils it down to its key elements, with a few changes that you will like. Most Importantly the shooting is locked to the Y-axis, opening up all sorts of possibilities. Projectiles only, so Run-n-Gun to your heart's content. Fly around in a Jet-pack, dodging enemy fire and shooting back with classic weapons like Shotguns, Machine Guns, Grenade and Rocket Launchers. Take on Bosses with massive health bars. Do it all as fast as you can, there is a timer on top. Speed-Run maybe. Since the beginning, this has been a one man project, and although it may not be up to AAA standards, a lot of effort is put into it to make the Gameplay worth the price. I would appreciate any feedback, and will take it into account to deliver a better experience.",
