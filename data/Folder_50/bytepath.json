    "About the game": "BYTEPATH is a replayable arcade shooter with a focus on varied play styles with RPG elements. The game has a huge passive skill tree, classes and different ships through which you'll be able to try out lots of different builds to achieve ever increasing high scores and eventually beat the game. Expect BYTEPATH to be a mix of Bit Blaster XL and Path of Exile , created with the intention of expanding Bit Blaster XL's relaxing and addictive gameplay with Path of Exile's build depth, build diversity and RPG elements. Gameplay Your ship can't stop moving, so you must turn it left and right or use your boost and brakes to prevent it from crashing on enemies. Your ship can't stop shooting, so you must continually kill enemies and collect ammo so you can keep using your powerful attacks. Items, resources and new attacks will be spawned randomly. Those will provide you with great boosts that may help you achieve higher scores in the current run. Features 900+ nodes passive skill tree, allowing for a huge amount of varied play styles and builds 40+ classes, each giving stat boosts and modifiers which further enhance your build 10+ ships, each providing unique stats and modifiers (both positive and negative) that dramatically change the way you play 15+ enemy types which are spawned with increasing frequency as the run gets harder 40+ Steam achievements Entrancing soundtrack by AIRGLOW",
