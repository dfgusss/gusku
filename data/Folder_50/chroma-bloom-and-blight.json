    "About the game": "Set in the whimsical lands of Arholt, Chroma: Bloom and Blight is a lore-rich card game that encourages players to tell a story, their story. Whether you’re a veteran competitive player or looking to play your first card game, Chroma has something for everyone; from the lore-focussed progression to the competitive ladder. Free-to-play is a heavily overused term, especially in the competitive card game genre. So when we say Chroma is free-to-play we really mean it! You’ll never need to buy a card pack again! Every card and game mode in Chroma: Bloom and Blight is free, and will always be free. We wanted players to be able to tell their story, on their terms, without breaking the bank or getting caught in a sluggish grind. So How Do You Make Money? It’s no secret that Chroma: Bloom and Blight is a live service game, and to remain a live service game money needs to be made. The store in Chroma will offer daily deals on a wide variety of cosmetics, from alternative card art, new boards, loading screens, taunts, and emotes. Chroma also offers players a premium battlepass, every reward on the battlepass is cosmetic - nothing gameplay-related will ever be locked behind a paywall. Chroma provides players a large selection of heroes to build their deck around. Heroes and cards offer a connection to one of four different factions, represented by different colours. There is no limitation on deck building in Chroma, choose your hero, and build your deck around their powerful abilities. Matches in Chroma play out as stories, each offering three acts. The progression of acts in the story will open up powerful new opportunities for players to utilise their hero’s abilities. Managing your resources, telling your story at the right pace, and utilising your leader at the right time are all key if you wish to become a legend in the lands of Arholt. Chroma is set in the lore-rich world of Arholt. Exploring different decks, playing cards, and winning with heroes will unlock new lore. Unlocking these secrets will provide more information on the world map of Arholt, allowing you to uncover some of the mysteries and dark secrets that are hidden in the world of Chroma.",
