    "About the game": "Welcome, Ladies &amp; Gentlemen! A-ha, how y'all doing? Now, the name of the game is to answer truest to yourself. There's no right and wrong, everyone's a winner! Ooorrr a loser, depending how you think about it. Life is all about perception, you see. Onto the first question! You're a murderer, we all know it. But do you think you are? Through a stroke of sheer luck, you've managed to escape death row. Taking to an underground subway, you must try to find your salvation. Can you break free of the past that binds you? And please, can you close your eyes? Just close them. Originally started as a 2014 Ludum Dare created RPG Maker Horror Game, reworked twice to become a brand new terrifying experience. Enter a horrific &amp; twisted surreal world full of diabolical traps, puzzles, &amp; questionnaires. Featuring original voice-work, artwork, &amp; music to help create an unsettling atmosphere. Multiple endings and a variety of secrets encourage multiple playthroughs, as things are not always what they seem.",
