    "About the game": "Dashing Dinos is a fast-paced, physics-based, local multiplayer game. Play against a couple of friends on your couch or bring your next house party to a whole new level! Choose the Dino that suits your play-style best and go wild with unique equipment choices. There is no reason why your Dino can't be a crazed, pumpkin-wielding Viking Angel! CHARGE your DASH-POWER to the max. AIM at your target. RELEASE the DASH and send your opponents flying! Secure your win with a variety of pickups! Enemies can be poisoned, frozen, confused, or even blown up, while you can escape safely - in invincible mode. Be the lone survivor in a deadly match! Score goals against your friends or steal their precious, precious eggs. There are so many ways you can win against your fellow players! You can team up or leave every Dino for himself. You think, victory is close, just because you've mastered all the moves and pickups? But beware, you're treading on thin ice! Mud is more slippery than volcanic rock and you don't want to end up in deadly spikes, thorns or the burning hot lava!",
