    "About the game": "The remote hotel stands atop an ominous snow-peaked mountain, and death permeates every inch of the place. A crime has been committed here obviously, and the remote nature of the retreat means that the culprit is still roaming the halls. Which of the guests is capable of this? Whose past hides sinister truths and who has the most to gain? Secrets will not reveal themselves and skeletons will not stay buried. Dead Mountaineer’s Hotel will test all your detection skills as well as your ideas of right and wrong.

Do you have what it takes to unravel the threads behind this mysterious case, and where will your side be should your own feelings conflict with the law?

More than 15 3D character models featuring real-time shadows, each with their own original stories and unique personalities.
