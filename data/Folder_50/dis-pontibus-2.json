    "About the game": "Dis Pontibus 2 is a single-player puzzle game set in a procedurally-generated archipelago. In this sequel to the first adventure, you are tasked with helping the archipelago's inhabitants by repairing their bridges, pushing and/or rotating their platforms. But platforms are more fragile in this world! You can move them only a limited number of times. Each game will be a different experience, with simple mechanics but very challenging gameplay.",
