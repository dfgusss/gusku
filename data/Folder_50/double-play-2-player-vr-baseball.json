    "About the game": "Double Play is a local two-player VR baseball game. One player pitches, one player hits, and AI fielders take care of the rest. Play through a complete game, taking turns hitting and pitching. The standard rules of baseball are at play: balls, strikes, fouls, home runs and more. Multiple skill level presets allow people of different ages and skills to play together. As the batter, you're fully immersed within the headset. Take your at-bats as the other player pitches. Well tuned physics makes hitting both realistic and controllable, but also approachable. Swing for the fences! As the pitcher, you watch the batter on the monitor and throw toward it as if it's home plate. Using one of the touch controllers, you control where the ball goes and how it gets there. Throw fastballs, curveballs, sinkers and more. Pitch inside the strike zone or out of it. Do whatever you can to make the batter miss! Key Features Two-player, local play Complete, standard baseball rules Well tuned hitting and fielding physics Fun, variable, and easy to control pitching AI fielders Multiple skill levels Post-game stats",
