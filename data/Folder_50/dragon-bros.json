    "About the game": "Robots are everywhere! They've conquered the whole planet, destroyed the place you used to call home and kidnapped your dragon-mom. That's not right, bros! Definitively not right. The only cure for this terrible mess is to exterminate those cranky machines with bullets and big explosions! Play as a young dragon in this 2D retro run &amp; gun adventure, in co-op or solo. Armed with shotguns and laser cannons, free your mom from the evil Mechaliches! Story Four teenage dragons go on an adventure to save their kidnapped mom. The culprits? The mechaliches! They are an evil robotic society who survived the collapse of a technologically advanced alien civilization. On their way, our dragons meet various mega bosses and learn more about their enemies goals.
