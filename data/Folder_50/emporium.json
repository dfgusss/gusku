    "Name": "EMPORIUM",
    "Release date": "May 17, 2017",
    "About the game": "Emporium is a short interactive vignette. Exploring notions of escapism, loss and a fragmented sense of self in the wake of a personal tragedy. These pockets of dissonant clarity are a vain effort to find beauty, poetry and reason in one's bleakest and most desperate moments. Emporium is a small game lasting roughly 30 to 45 minutes. It has a minimal approach to game play, focusing on visuals and audio to build a visceral experience with sporadic dialogue choices leading the narrative.",
