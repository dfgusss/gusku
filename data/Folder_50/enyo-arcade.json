    "About the game": "ENYO Arcade resembles a modern 2d action platformer. Notable for its unique gameplay, depth in atmosphere and merciless action. Avoid or fight various hazards and find your way to the exit in the fastest and most efficient way possible. Violence is not required to complete this game! ENYO is also a growing piece of expression radiating a chaotic nebular that I'm still trying to decipher myself. Please be aware that this game is not a re-creation of old video games and content may change with future updates! More information in the news section! Features: Includes non-violent path 16+ unique AI types High quality sub-pixel art at 60 frames per second with attention to details Tight and responsive controls - always stay in direct control of the action No 'holding hands and leading the way' Movement focused on: jumping!! Atmospheric audio visual experience Steam achievements and leader boards Keyboard controls can be remapped! Personal: Hi! My name is James. I used to have a life as regular 3d artist. Since 2012 I am trying to gain traction as solo game developer. ENYO Arcade is my first solo-developed game. And Temple Of Rust is my next upcoming title.",
