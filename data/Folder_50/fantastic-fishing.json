    "About the game": "Fantastic Fishing is a short open world harpooner. Explore the oceans to find and capture new kinds of fish while staying clear of the predators that lurk at every level. Explore the Open Oceans Will you stick to the shallows or brave the dark depths? Explore the open oceans in this handcrafted world to find new biomes, upgrades, and of course, fish. Customize Your Submarine Use the fish you catch to upgrade your submarine. Make it more durable, make it faster, or switch out your harpoon for something more interesting. You'll need to choose the right submarine for you. Gotta Catch 'Em All All the wildlife you find throughout the game can be caught, but it doesn't mean they are going to make it easy.",
