Brief background: The main character, Deacon, an office worker, is struggling with some illness, because of it he can control his dreams. You have to overcome your fear, going through gloomy locations for the main character, along the way solving various puzzles and trying to understand what is happening in general, in what the lines with which Deacon accompanies various situations will help you.
