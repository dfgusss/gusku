You will encounter a different gaming experience each time you play. Game Modes: - Single player: Single player versus Artificial Intelligence. - Cooperative Mode: Players versus Artificial Intelligence. - Satan Mode: Players versus player who is controlling the Satan. Satan has 8 different skills to use on other players. About the Game : Fear Therapy is a theory that has long been researched by psychologists. The lack of sufficient data makes it difficult to prove this theory. Many people have done real-time experiments to prove this theory before, but they were too scared to complete the experiment and interrupted it. The main subject of this theory is that, people start not to be afraid of the fear factors they encounter for the first time after a while.The result of most of the experimental studies is that,the subjects overcome the fear they are exposed to. But after a while this fear starts again. Subjects who are constantly exposed to this fear become numb. As another result of the study, subjects exposed to fear start out more courageously when exposed to fear again. We have tried to convey the content of this therapy to you as much as we can and we are glad to say that you will experience everything about this therapy. The game is currently in early access. There may be minor errors in the game. You can report these errors to us via Discord. We are constantly working to provide an error-free game. Thank you for your understanding.",
