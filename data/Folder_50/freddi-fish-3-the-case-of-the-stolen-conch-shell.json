Rosy Pearl, Pierre the Tailor and Nadine the Narwhal are just a few of the fun new friends they'll meet as they follow Old Snoggy's sniffer through this tropical paradise. In the end, it's up to your child to piece the clues together and figure out who's responsible for this underwater caper! Play again and again-new clues, new locations and new culprits await! Click Points reveal hundreds and hundreds of hidden surprises. Sing songs, play games, watch a luau and create your very own melodies. Out of time? Save the game and finish it later.
