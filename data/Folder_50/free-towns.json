Citizens are recruited and die and depends on you to keep them healthy, happy, and well-fed. Your aim is to create a prosperous and thriving city, using your production and manufacturing capabilities to create raw materials and goods. The profits can then be invested back into improving the lives of your citizens / increasing your production capacity or mine more gold. The internal currency is Free Towns Gold that can be only mined (players can't buy gold). There are over 10 different occupations that the people in the city can perform from farming, hunting, blacksmithing, to gold mining or firefighting. No single strategy will succeed for every town. It’s up to player to build / upgrade roads, resources or utility buildings and recruit new citizens. It's not easy. Buildings degrade every day and will collapse without renovation. Citizens will die after a while and resource buildings will stop the production without employees and so on. - Build your city in any imaginable combination. Bask in the awe-inspiring glory of more than 20 unique buildings (each building can be upgraded up to 5 levels). - Assign your workers to various jobs (Wood cutters, farmers, firemen...) - Manage your resources carefully and increase your citizens happiness / life span - Expand your city over a huge map",
