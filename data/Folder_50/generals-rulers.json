    "About the game": "You take control of the country and begin to fight with neighbors for the expansion of your empire. We tried to throw out the whole grind from the strategy game. All boring and annoying elements. There remains essentially pure tactic and strategy. The game is not just dynamic - the 'Generals and Rulers' is the dynamics itselves. The game has a huge number of development options and you can play 10 games that will be completely different and not similar to each other. High replayability is probably one of the main trump cards of the Generals and Rulers. 1207 is the year when the world began to learn about the Mongol invasion. It seems that Asia can still confront them, and in Europe the Holy Roman Empire dominates. Whether you want to play for the Mongol Horde or choose any of the other 80 countries - it's up to you. What is in the game in terms of numbers: - 2.000 regions on 2 maps - 50 playable countries on each map - 32 types of sciences - 10 types of troops - 5 types of attacks on neighboring countries - The length of each batch of 2 hours - Wars and battles, Rebels, Influence of religion, Mercenaries, Diplomacy, Spying, Trade relations with other countries, Advanced AI and of course Science, Building armies, Improvment of units",
