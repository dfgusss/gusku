    "About the game": "A challenging arcade score-attack game with a unique mechanic... Chain together ghosts with your energy beam, then destroy them all at once to earn points. The longer your chain, the bigger your score multiplier. Destroy endless waves of increasing difficulty, navigate a frantic phantom bullet hell, and unlock 'Robot Mods' to help you climb the leaderboards. Each session lasts just a few minutes! It's perfect to kill some time (and ghosts) during a lunch break or to compete with friends! Humanity is long gone, but our wretched souls still wander the Earth. THE GRAPPLE BEAM: Chain ghosts together, destroy them all at once, and even absorb enemy bullets for energy using this unique new game mechanic. ENDLESS BULLET HELL: The spectral onslaught never stops! Fight ever-increasing enemy numbers until your little robot chassis can take no more. POWER-UPS: Blast ghosts with EMP shockwaves or rocket-boost to safety. Choose how you power-up your abilities in unique ways to make each run play differently. CUSTOMISE YOUR ROBOT: Unlock 'Robot Mods' to fine-tune your abilities. Customise your hit points, speed, battery power and more, with over 100 possible combinations. UNLOCK DIFFICULTY MODES: 3 apocalyptic levels that push your skills to the limit, each one more intense and challenging than the last. NUKE THE APOCALYPSE: When all else fails, launch a nuke and make the apocalypse even more apocalypsed.",
