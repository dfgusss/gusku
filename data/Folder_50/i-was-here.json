All photos in the game were shot by our friend who travels a lot around Europe, Russia and the Caucasus region in general. Though not a professional photographer or traveller, after several years of wandering the world, he developed a set of photos with an unusual perspective that delivers his own take on places both obscure and well-known. This game is a showcase of some of his works. Besides this, “I Was Here” also dishes plenty of amazing and interesting facts about places you might not know. Gameplay comprises a meditative contemplation of photos in an attempt to guess the city they were taken in. Clues involving facts about the city will help you if you have doubts.
