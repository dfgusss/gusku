    "About the game": "_ The ICARUS.1 Abandoned for decades, crew M.I.A _ In its original form winner of Edge Magazine - Get into Games contest 2015 'I turned the lights down for a really immersive experience' David Helgason - Unity Technologies founder 'The game brings back feelings of first playing System Shock or Half-Life. I love creepy, empty space ships with history' Robin Hunicke - Funomena CEO _ Abandoned for decades, crew MIA, the ICARUS.1's job was to store mined minerals from the systems outlying planets and perform research duties. Orbiting the local sun to maintain it's solar energy and live up to its namesake, it provided a lucrative business for JME corp. After contact was lost no rescue attempt was ever made with the stricken station, instead the project was mothballed along with its precious cargo - a cover up some may say. Many stories about what happened have become lore but Sam isn't focusing on these 'stories', the goal is the cargo and the wealth it will bring.",
