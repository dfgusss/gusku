    "About the game": "Fight enemies with four different styles in turn-based tactical combat. Grant mercy to your enemies and maybe they will spare you. Flee from the fight you can't win, and return with friends. Avoid and bargain spiritual foes, who can't be defeat in battle. Step in the world of the well known, but still different fantasy! The combat system is inspired by tactical turn-based RPG, such as Divinity and Pillars of Eternity. It will probably change with time, but the main focus will stay on different damage types. The resource gathering are still under work, and we expect your feedback on it. Notice, that the game is in early access, a lot of content is still missing, a lot of bugs is still there.",
