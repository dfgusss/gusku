As you break from the rain of fire, you fall prey to a ground trap and plunge into the dark abyss - A mysterious dungeon filled with infernal creatures of dark magic and the undead. How far did you fall? Will you ever reach the surface or will this dungeon be your tomb, like so many others who have fallen before?
