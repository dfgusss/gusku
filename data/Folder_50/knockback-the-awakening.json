    "About the game": "This is early alpha software. Gameplay will change over time. You and your adventurous buddies are experimenting with some magical trinkets after your last quest when you hear moaning in the forest. You turn and see a hideous bug-eyed zombie wielding a copper frying pan and charging right at you. Instinctively, you throw a nearby rock at the undead creature — and down he goes! “Hey, that was kinda FUN. What happens if I combine a rock and sticky snail snot?“ This first-person wave defense game is built for maximum fun for one, or groups of two, three, or four. Knockback is filled with magical weapons that enable you to eliminate zombies in your own personal ways. Work with your buddies and have fun defending against hordes of zombies, keep from being overwhelmed, last out all the rounds, and kill the boss for the win. And it’s all about how you do it! Knockback is a physics sandbox that challenges you to ask yourself “how many ways can I destroy the zombies?” Go ahead play with fire! Throw ’em into a building or smash ’em with a log rolling down a hill. Wanna suck the zombies into a tight ball and zap ‘em with lightning? You can do that. Rain down sticky stones of fire onto their heads? Gotcha covered. Hit ‘em with a giant rolling stone that bowls down the baddies? Go for it! Now get out there and stick a snail snot rock to an unsuspecting zombie chin! Notable Quotes: 'I had a blast playing this game.' - AJ, /",
