    "About the game": "TROUBLE ON PLANET LUCETIA! The prince has been kidnapped. The royal guard, known as Renova, has gone missing. Aether has returned... As Magnetta, only you have the power to stop him! Magnetta is a side-scrolling action game in the vein of classic NES titles. Jump, shoot, slide and blast your way through unique and challenging levels as you collect new weapons and upgrades, hunt down secret areas, and defeat your enemies to ensure peace in the galaxy. You'll need to master every skill at your disposal if you're going to climb Aether's tower and take him out once and for all! Fight your way through scrambled up levels in the Glitch, where the tilesets shift and change around you. Everything looks like you've got a dirty cartridge, and you'll need to know what you're doing to make it through and rescue your friends. Time Trials: The game keeps track of your fastest times on each level. You can return to levels you've already cleared and take them on again with new weapons and abilities, so find hidden shortcuts and master the best tricks for the fastest times. Magnetta also supports online leaderboards, so your friends can see how much better you are. Speed Run Mode: Once you've mastered the game and shaved down your level times, take what you've learned into Speedrun Mode. This mode clocks a continuous time for a full game playthrough. Don't mess up, there are no do-overs here. Challenge Mode: Take on a range of themed challenges. Do you have what it takes to clear them all? Unlockable Extras: Find collectible circuits throughout the game to unlock extra stuff like cosmetic changes or bonus abilities. Cusomizable Controls: Play the way you want. Filtering Options: Play in pixel perfect or add scanlines and anisotropic filtering to recreate the look of playing on a CRT 8 Unlockable Weapons: Destroy your enemies and traverse the levels in new ways Bestiary: Find and destroy all enemy types to complete your bestiary. Check for other info like weaknesses, kill count, and little flavor text. Authentic Soundtrack: These songs sound the part, and could play on actual NES hardware.",
