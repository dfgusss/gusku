    "About the game": "In the not-so-distant future, society runs through one government-controlled Central Computer that has drawn the ire of many. No civilian has ever been inside... until today. A devious group of misfits has somehow gotten inside. As a very gifted hacker yourself, it's your job to chase them down and stop them before they are able to destroy the core. Good luck, Maya. Maya's Dice is a 2D puzzle-based RPG with a unique twist. Instead of battling enemies with fists or knowledge of Victorian Architecture, players try to outwit, outmaneuver, and confidently lie their way through the dice bluffing game, Liar's Dice. With a dynamic battle environment built on very few rules that are easy to learn, Maya's Dice provides a unique, elegant, and engaging framework through which the player experiences the world of the future, and uncovers the mysteries therein. As the game progresses, things begin to change... and a very important choice is presented.",
