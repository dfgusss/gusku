    "About the game": "Mind Shadows is the first standalone game that my friend and I have made since graduating college in 2020. As a tunnel rat during Vietnam your sole purpose was to hunt the enemy that lurked below. But that was years ago. You left that life behind, it was hard, it took its toll, and for the most part, you're content. However, for some reason tonight feels different, and in a way, almost familiar. As you were watching football it begins to eat at you and dredge up the old question that you were in a unique position to answer. In your experience, sometimes the monsters are real. Mind Shadows is a phycological horror game that takes you through a short horror experience as you live through events set in Vietnam, explore a 1980's house and try to piece together if this is reality, or all in your mind.",
