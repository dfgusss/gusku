    "About the game": "Retro-style Pirate MMORPG with large focus on community and PvP Free-to-play forever! Become a Sailor in a harsh sea of thieves and heroes! Start off as a sailor and choose to join the Navy or become a Pirate! Become scum of the sea, or become a hero in the eyes of the law. Things aren't black and white in the world of Pirate Souls. Open World PvP &amp; Hardcore Game Design This may be a turn off for some, but Pirate Souls is a very hardcore game. So take this as a word of warning... Absolute freedom when it comes to PvP also means a bad time for some with a low tolerance for being killed for no reason. But for others, it's just another reason to get stronger! Deep Character Customization in the right places Choose your faction, join a crew and obtain a soul fruit power. Combined with thousands of equip-able items, no two seafarers will ever look or be the same. Pirate Souls is a game where you are encouraged to express yourself. Looking good doesn't cost you to lose fights.",
