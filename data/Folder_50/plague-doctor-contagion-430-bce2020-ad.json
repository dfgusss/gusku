    "About the game": "Set during four pivotal epidemics that changed history, Plague Doctor: Contagion 430 BCE–2020 AD is a single-player, first-person narrative adventure about greed, compassion, and courage in times of crisis. Explore four cities—each battling a deadly outbreak—and make choices that will save or cost the lives of countless people. Roam the streets of Athens, recording the effects of a mysterious virus so that future generations might recognize and treat it. Inspect the merchant ship Grand-Saint-Antoine for signs of the plague as an official of the Marseille sanitation authority. Bring an exploding influenza outbreak under control in Philadelphia, mere weeks after the super-spreader Liberty Loan parade. Experience the disorienting reality of quarantine in Louisville, while protests against racial injustice rock the city. The tone of each chapter is as unique as the disease outbreaks themselves. The only constant is that you are in the center of it all, doing your part to prevent a growing pandemic by controlling the contagion. A Compact Narrative Game: Plague Doctor: Contagion 430 BCE–2020 AD was made with care by a very small team to be a short but impactful experience—the full game is estimated to take around one hour to complete. Its linear narrative is driven by player exploration and immersive storytelling rather than combat or puzzles. Dive into the four chapters one by one, or all in one sitting—it’s up to you. The video game debut of Actors Theatre of Louisville Actors Theatre of Louisville brings together groundbreaking artists to tell exhilarating multi-platform stories onstage, online, and beyond. This video game was made in collaboration with a solo indie game developer from Two Scoop Games (also of Louisville). Plague Doctor: Contagion 430 BCE–2020 AD is a video game about adults having adult conversations about adult things. If you plan on playing with a younger gamer, that might be good to know going in.",
