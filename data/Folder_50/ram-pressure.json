    "About the game": "Tactical story-driven online multiplayer game combining the turn-based combat of X-COM with a deep, well-grounded sci-fi setting. Experience intense tactical online multiplayer action and explore a deep plot and unique storyline built on both single-player and multiplayer missions. In the near future, Earth is hit by an unusual meteorite swarm: the remains of alien fleets decimated by an ancient galactic war. To avoid widespread panic, world governments hide the truth from the population by sending elite mercenary squads to crash sites – gaining access to the alien technology before anyone else can do the same. As a leader of one of these paramilitary organizations, you have to successfully scout, secure, and deliver the weapons and intel found in each alien crash site to paying governments indifferent to loss of life. In time – while performing extremely dangerous incursions for alien artifacts – you begin to lift the veil behind government conspiracies and state-sponsored attempts to use alien technology to control the world’s population. This is only the tip of the iceberg as far as “first contact” goes: Humanity faces a much more real serious threat that could lead to the total eradication of mankind. In physics, “ram pressure” is a pressure exerted on a body moving through a fluid medium, caused by relative bulk motion of the fluid rather than random thermal motion. It causes a drag force to be exerted on the body. . . . A meteoroid traveling supersonically through Earth's atmosphere produces a shock wave generated by the extremely rapid compression of air in front of the meteoroid. It is primarily this ram pressure (rather than friction) that heats the air that in turn heats the meteoroid as it flows around it. Engage in pitched battles against other units as well hostile intelligence services. The goal? Establish contact with any surviving alien beings and uncover the factors that led to the extinction of their civilization. To succeed, you will need to equip and customize your soldiers to make them a well oiled, effective fighting force … eventually gaining knowledge of secrets literally beyond imagination. Experience intense tactical online multiplayer action. Explore a deep plot and unique storyline built on both single-player and multiplayer missions. Upgrade your weapons and armor from a massive selection of 100 guns and 10 weapon classes – including high-tech and alien weapons. Customize your characters with 12 classes and 160 skills. Lay waste to the environment for tactical purposes! Enjoy procedurally-generated maps, day and night missions, and changing weather conditions.",
