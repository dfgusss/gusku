    "About the game": "Story Outline In this side-scrolling platform shooter, you play John Ombar: a traumatized war veteran who is trying to settle into civilian life with his wife, Jenny. When the city's residents and law enforcement agencies are distracted by widespread protests, a deeply entrenched gang of law-breakers seizes upon the opportunity to take control of the city. Suppressing all opposition with violence and threats, the gang is free to execute its drug-peddling, gun-running and more. When John refuses to submit to the gang's protection racket, he is brutally beaten and left for dead. Unfortunately for the gang, they also abduct John's wife, pushing him too far and forcing him to go on a rampage of revenge. With the Red Mist filling his vision, John vows to flood the city with Rivers of Blood. Features Use your trusty handgun to blast your way through levels. If you run out of ammo, jump-kicking might save you for a while. Pick up a more powerful gun to wreak more carnage or a sword to hack and slash your enemy. Want more carnage? How about a tank? You are also a mean motorcyclist. You must do whatever it takes to exact justice for Jenny in this epic run-and-gun platformer! You've played Red Dead... now let's kick it up a gear with Red Mist! /",
