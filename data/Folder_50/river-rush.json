    "About the game": "How it's meant to be played in the first place? Imagine you are impatiently waiting for pizza you ordered and need some distraction. This is it ! Have you ever played old vertically scrolling shoot 'em ups but wanted more? Then River Rush is a game for you. It's easy to start playing and easy to get to the next checkpoint (about 15 minutes). An improved version of oldschool SHMUP games , like River Raid, 1940, Harrier Attack, Galaga etc. Survive by evading or destroying enemies. Keep an eye on fuel and avoid terrain that is not river. Your weapons for terminating enemies are laser bullets (like form old GI Joe and Transformers cartoons) plus rockets. Rockets are fired with delay of 0.4 sec so you have to think ahead when to use them. You move with WAD or Arrows. Fire bullets with Space and rockets with N It has challenging gameplay, if you don't think ahead you'll get into mayhem from which it won't be easy to get out. Enhanced pixel art experience from the 80es. 13 types of enemies. Each needing a different approach. No need for mouse, just keyboard. Local leader board (like on old arcade machines, one per one PC). Relive your youth. Or see what dad used to play :)",
