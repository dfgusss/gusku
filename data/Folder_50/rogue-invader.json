    "About the game": "In Rogue Invader, YOU are the invader attacking the alien horde in this genre-flipping roguelite shooter. 1-Bit black and white old-school art style, with modern touches and HD graphics. Twenty years ago, the Zenos began invading Terran colonies, leaving a trail of death and tears in their wake. Terrans fought back, one planet at a time, while building a fleet to stab at the Zeno home-world. You arrive with that fleet, just after a series of massive space battles in which all supply ships have been destroyed. You are left with a huge invasion army but no supplies to invade with other than one drop-pod, and one pistol. Your standing orders are clear: END THIS WAR!",
