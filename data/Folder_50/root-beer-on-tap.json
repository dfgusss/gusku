Keep track of all the unique customers in 17 levels of mug tossing fun. FEATURES Works great with Valve Index Controllers, Root Beer On Tap uses finger tracking and makes heavy use of the grab and pinch inputs. Game-play reminiscent of 80's arcade games, re-imagined from the ground up exclusively for Virtual Reality. 17 levels encompassing 5 themes have you serving root beer around the world! Pick-up-and-play style controls and short play rounds can be passed around and shown quickly at parties! Broke a mug? No cleanup required in VR! Works with all major VR headsets and controllers! Hitting a button too easily? Change it with full support for Input remapping via SteamVR Input. Root beer floats! Everyone loves a tasty root beer float!",
