    "About the game": "Lights blur. The crowd whizzes past. Your helmet rattles against the roll bar and the competition switches into overdrive. Tears stream from your eyes and the race moves into extreme speed. Tears of sweat. The same stuff that's seeping off your palms and onto the steering wheel. Get a grip. You're sliding into a turn at 200 miles per hour and centrifugal force will only carry you so far. This is velocity-driven, pedal-to-the-metal arcade racing. Strapped into a personally chosen made-for-the-Autobahn racing machine, you'll scream to redefine fast in this winding 3D ride of pure fun. Great, addictive, arcade-style gameplay Driving mechanics so unrealistic they’ll make you wish you could powerslide like that in real life! If you didn’t have a Pentium processor back in 1995, now is your chance to finally play this game!",
