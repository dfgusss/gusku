    "About the game": "Screencheat is the ridiculous split-screen shooter where everyone is invisible, so you have to “screencheat”! Screencheat: (verb) to look at your opponent’s screen. e.g. “Stop screencheating you cheater!” Master a wide variety of one-hit kill weapons, including a blunderbuss, a car engine that shoots bouncing plasma balls, and a teddy bear loaded with explosives. Train your skills in the solo time trials, then engage in fast and frantic combat with up to eight players locally or online. With colourful maps, unique modes and a huge number of customisation options, including wacky mutators, Screencheat is the ultimate party FPS. Join our community on Discord ! Ranging from the dependable Blunderbuss to the heroic Hobby Horse and completely crazy Chefolet, all weapons are designed to deliver deadly satisfaction. Their unique advantages and disadvantages encourage wildly different play styles, including not only the way a weapon shoots, but also the 'tells' the weapon leaves behind. Watch out for the smoke from the blunderbuss, or the trail of fire behind the Hobby Horse... From traditional favourites like Deathmatch to the unique Murder Mystery, Screencheat's nine game modes provide something for everyone. Play in teams or all against all! Enjoy the split-screen fun by challenging up to seven of your mates on the couch or online, or even a combination of both. When your friends aren't around, train your skills and learn the maps in the solo time trials, or play against AI bots. In the spirit of the best arena shooters, you’ll traverse 11 maps via air vents and trampolines until you’ve acquired your target. Each map is designed with colour-coded areas and plentiful landmarks, such as statues, paintings and furniture, that allow you to quickly locate other players using your screencheating skills! Inspired by games like Towerfall, we've provided players with a highly granular level of customisation to play the game their way. Choose which weapons you'll allow, how and when they can be swapped or reloaded, apply time limits, adjust the victory conditions, add penalties and more. To really mix it up, try stacking on some mutators, like slow mode, low gravity or flappy jump.",
