    "About the game": "Scriptur is a kinetic visual novel featuring original artworks, soundtrack, and characters. The main character woke up on the train, he does not know how he ended up in it and where he was going. On top of that, he has the same strange dream all the time. What does this all mean? What is the secret behind all this? Will it be possible to reveal it and finally restore the lost memories of what happened? Visual novels are a genre of video games that leans heavily on plot and literature contents, which most resemble that of a book. The kinetic novels are a sub-genre that defines visual novels with little to no choice of the characters' actions, leading to a single-optioned, linear story with a strong narrative direction. Typically, kinetic novels are known to trade variability and replayability values for a stronger and/or more emotional delivery of the plot, following the directorial idea more precisely, although the absence of that is not always the case with the multi-routed player's choice-based type visual novels. The main gameplay loop of visual novels usually involves the implementation of user controls to ensure the conduction of the player's ability to express their will to continue with the story by clicking or tapping the free space on the game screen and reading the appeared lines of dialogues or author's descriptions. Simultaneously, the game screen may change accordingly with the progression of the plot: background images change, character sprites take turns going out on the stage, the music suits the needs of the moment. It is not only suitable but also useful to subtract the conventions of the experience and see this kind of media for its origins — theatrical plays — to esteem the possibilities of digital realms in storytelling.",
