    "About the game": "Play as a gunner in B-25 bomber. Shoot enemy interceptors from a first person view and support friendly air forces to finish the bombing mission. There are 4 types of turrets available: chose between side, tail, top or nose gunner positions to resist enemy attacks. In this game you are not allowed to pilot the airplane because the main focus is a gunner view of the battle, so you can observe, shoot and override some orders. This game features detailed movement inside the airplane including passages that exist in real B-25. The main objective is to drain enemy reinforcements by destroying enemy airplanes and/or fire support ships.",
