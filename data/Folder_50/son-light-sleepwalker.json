    "About the game": "This game contains both the VR and Desktop editions allowing you to play either. Steam defaults to the Windows or Linux full release based on your OS. The Windows VR is in beta - to play it, right click on the game title in your library and choose Properties-&gt;Betas to enable the VR beta designed for the Oculus. In Son.Light.Sleepwalker (pronounced 'sunlight sleepwalker'), you are the dad of a frightening, sleepwalking son. His psychologist said to never let him awake while sleep walking. Using the house security cameras, smart light switches, and even his drone, lead him back to his room. But DON'T LET HIM GET INTO THE LIGHT! OR HE MAY AWAKE! Son.Light.Sleepwalker is a strategy game full of building suspense, jump scares, and eerie challenges. It has an unsuspecting story with an amazing twist at the end. You have to use your wit as the suspense builds through each encounter. The VR version (in Beta) is the absolute most immersive game play. For those with a laptop/tablet, the ideal gaming scenario would be lying in bed with head phones - or on a PC with the lights out. The game is fully voice acted in surround sound. The frightful whispers between the mom and dad will cause chills up your spine. This presents immersive gameplay that will give you a truly memorable experience.
