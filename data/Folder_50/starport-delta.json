    "About the game": "Welcome, Recruit. Station Commanders around the universe are running into all sorts of problems with their starbases. Embark on a journey to help manage their resources, optimise station layouts, and defend civilians from life threatening dangers. Are you up to the challenge? Starport Delta is a light strategy game that challenges veterans, yet is approachable for newcomers. The game’s campaign mode teaches you the basics, while sandbox mode allows you to aim for the stars. The aim is to survive, so make sure to keep an eye on those resources! Developed by Cloudfire Studios, a two-person team from New Zealand, Starport Delta is always growing. The team is always happy to listen and respond to ideas from the community via Steam or the official Starport Delta Discord . Currently Featuring: Space dangers Get ready to take on meteor showers, alien pirates, giant space worms and more! Each of these perilous challenges requires their own unique solution, so make sure to build accordingly, or you may lose more than you bargained for. Engaging campaign With understaffed stations and negligent Commanders, it’s a wonder the Empire didn’t call you in sooner! Move from system to system, troubleshooting station problems as you go. Supply resources, cull unneeded expansions and ensure sustainable growth before warping to the next system. Diverse Voices With a total cast of 15, Starport Delta features incredible talent from around the world. As you play through the campaign, you’ll encounter beings from every corner of the galaxy. Each character has their own tale to share, their own struggles they must face. Listen to their journeys, learn from their mistakes, and you just might help them along the way. Sandbox Mode Take your time and explore all that the galaxy has to offer in Zen Mode. Build at your own pace, upgrading and expanding your space city as you go. Or perhaps you’re looking for something a bit more challenging? Try out Hard Mode, where we throw all of the perils of the game your way and it’s up to you to survive. Unique upgrades Upgrades to your station happen organically through proximity. Grouping three power plants in a cluster will supply a larger area with power and require less maintenance, as well as linking together their structural integrity. Design your own unique station layouts by exploring the variety of different upgrades and the impact they each have.",
