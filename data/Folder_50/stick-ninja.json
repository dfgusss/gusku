    "About the game": "2 to 15 ninjas can fight at once. In this black and white world seek out and destroy your opponents. Travel to three different lands. Kill your enemies as you leap from tall trees, hide behind a simple house, even a snowman, as you chill out in winter wonderland. Finish the job with a shuriken or do it with your deadly sword. Fight to be the best on the scoreboard but remember, when it comes to first place there can be only one.",
