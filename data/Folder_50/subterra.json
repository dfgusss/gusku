    "About the game": "Earth is but a memory. Humanity has been banished to the darkness of the underground and the mighty Devordor casts a shadow of evil over all that remains. The hordes of spawn are stirring, a terrible war is brewing and a sickness known only as ‘the Pale’ threatens to destroy the scattered remnants of civilization that hide in the lonely abyss. When Dian is diagnosed with the Pale, her brother Dryst steps up to challenge fate and embarks on a journey that will see him come face to face with his destiny and the terror that is Devordor. Along the way, he will forge new friendships, claim the mighty sword Mallbane and confront his own inner demons. Will his path lead humanity to salvation and a return to the light of Earth, or are they doomed to live forever under the tyranny of Devordor? Subterra is a classic-style RPG and with its well-realized world, gripping storyline and compelling characters, it makes a perfect treat for retro fans everywhere.",
