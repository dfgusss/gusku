    "About the game": "You can play minesweeper, but you can have custom skins, campaign puzzles and your very own pet who evolves as you play. You can create your own skins and your own campaigns. An important feature is the solver which ensures that your puzzle is solvable (except in cases where the grid is overcrowded). This is a departure from most throwaway minesweeper games where you can get impossible puzzles. How to play left click to open a tile, right click to add a flag, then again to turn that flag into a question mark, hold right mouse button or middle mouse button to move the grid around. scroll wheel to zoom in and out. When you hold the middle mouse button it will light up the nearby tiles. so if a tile says 4, the 4 bombs will be within the lit up tiles. this is especially useful for new players and the new sphere mode. collect gems to change your pet's colour. as it eats more gems, the effect gets less so you can fine tune it. Complete campaign puzzles and it will evolve to second and then third form. in third form, you can complete even more campaigns to gain accessories for the pet. Collect sweepers or magnets for the pet to use on your puzzle and give you an advantage!",
