[STORY] Once upon a time, in a topsy-turvy world... In the beginning, you find yourself lost within a world of utter darkness. Your memories are gone; even your name is a mystery. But just when the bitter loneliness threatens to break your spirit, you meet Alice—a blond-haired, blue-eyed young man who promptly christens you 'Arisu.' Like you, Alice cannot remember anything beyond his own name. Ignoring his protests, you drag him along with you through the darkness... until you happen upon a massive mirror made of crystal. You stumble through the glass and into the Looking-Glass World, an antiquated fairytale dreamscape that feels oddly familiar... There, amid a colorful cast of gender-swapped fairytale characters, you take on the role of the heroine and join them in their twisted tales. How will the story end? It's up to you! ONCE UPON A TIME, you meet a handsome prince who rescues you from a sticky predicament. It's love at first sight—assuming you can get past your overprotective brothers, that is! Everything about him is a mystery... Can you solve his riddle and melt his frozen heart? Be warned: it'll take more than a kiss! ONCE UPON A TIME, you live in a fine mansion with five handsome brothers: Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Kaguya, Snow White, and Gretel, all of whom are currently engaged to you. But then you receive an anonymous threat: If you don't choose to marry one of the five by the next full moon, you're dead meat! Naturally, you hire a private detective to get to the bottom of this case. Can the two of you work together to find the culprit? And in the end, who will you choose?
