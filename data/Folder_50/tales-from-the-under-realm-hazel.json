    "About the game": "Tales Of The Under-Realm: Hazel is a dark themed yuri visual novel that takes place in the fantasy world of Aravorn (already seen in games like Loren The Amazon Princess). A mysterious entity known as the Nameless God serves as the main narrator of the story, having the ability to peek in on the life of deceased souls and discover what brought them to a premature death. In this case, the Nameless God takes an interest in the fate of a witch named Hazel. Captured, she wakes up in a prison somewhere in Aravorn. She's not alone though. Locked in the cell next to her is an assassin named Sasha who is as lethal as she is beautiful. But can Hazel trust her just because they're in a similar situation? The alternative is putting her faith in the paladin interrogating her. While that option is far from ideal in it's own right, Hazel can't help but feel a special connection to Tori. Is it just in her head though? Or can she really use that bond to escape? The answer is no, of course. Hazel did end up in the Under-Realm one way or another. But is that all there is to her story? Do all of her choices lead to death? Or does she have one final trick up her sleeve? Tales Of The Under-Realm: Hazel features two love interests, Sasha and Tori. Each of them have multiple endings that are based on the choices the player makes during the game. The events of this story take place in Aravorn during the year 700, after the Human Empire has been split into regions and city-states due to civil unrest and power-hungry wizards. The Cast Hazel - One of the last witches in Aravorn - at least, that's what the Council of Grimoire thinks. She's being held prisoner in the hopes that she'll spill what she knows about the rest of them. Now Hazel has to somehow find a way to protect her fellow witches and herself. Sasha - Hazel's chatty cellmate. Though she seems to be an open book, she's actually rather mysterious. She hasn't had an easy life which is what ultimately led to her becoming an assassin for hire. Don't be deceived by her appearance, she has more than earned that title. Tori - Once a Disciple of Truth, she left the temple on Mount Kronos to found her own order of Templars. Strong and determined, she is in charge of a task force responsible for hunting down any witches left in Aravorn.",
