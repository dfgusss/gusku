    "About the game": "This game is now a test project and serves to gather various experiences, improvements and precursors of a new, already in development Free-2-Play, multiplayer-based, party game. 'Customize your own character, join a clan, compete against other players in many different game modes, collect your bonuses and become the champion of AGON.' Since this game was developed by one person and he jumped into the project without any previous experience, there are certain shortcomings. It was also up for debate whether this game would be developed further. No, it will not for the time being. The Creature will be back, eventually... Everything that is earned from this game will be invested directly into the new game. News will follow. Description of the early access game 'The Creature': 'It's a long story, but let's start with the past... In the 'old 80s' there was a rumor that an alien species was stranded here on earth. It was hostile to us and wanted to kill us all. But this creature was stopped by brave teenagers... What were the chances that this group was in the same place at the exact time? But, you know... This is not the last time there's been a rumor like this. There have been several stories of such creatures. Were any of them real? Even several years later, there have been incidents that describe exactly this event. Unbelievable... isn't it? Well, my boy. Sooner or later the whole world knew that these events were true, and then it happened... But this is a story for another time...' - Zaiden to his son in the year 177. This game doesn't currently offer anything like what it will offer in the future. It will be very exciting when all the stories come together. But we want to make the start to get the necessary experience of how this game will be received by you and where we need to improve. But what is there to play here? 'Kill or Die', a multiplayer mode for up to five players: You heard it in the story of Zaiden. In the old 80s there were teenagers who defeated a hostile creature. Well, you know... Let's jump back to that point and take the role ourselves. In this mode, you can be one of four teenagers, or the hostile creature trying to kill the teenagers. As a teenager, you must destroy crystals to close a portal and disable the creature's protective armor. Only then can you attack and finish them off. As a creature, you must stop the teenagers and survive. By a mysterious effect, there are also altars that can be used for special actions to make it difficult for the other team. Kill or die. 'Hunt', a single player mode (soon to be co-op mode) Zaiden also told of similar events after the heroic deeds of the teenage group. You can experience exactly these events in this mode. You are with other people in an area that has long since been abandoned or never entered. Now you have to coexist with them and fight for survival. But that is not all. One or more stranded creatures live in this area and will kill you and the other humans if possible. Defend yourself, hunt them and survive.",
