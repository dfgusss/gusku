STORY “I am an onmyoji, after all…” It is the year 2014 in the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo, Japan. The capital, having remained largely unscathed by major air raids for the duration of World War II, has settled into an enthralling blend of the remnants of the old days and the developments of the new over time. Although the country should be at peace, lately it has been afflicted by horrifying incidents of assaults by ayakashi—supernatural creatures and spirits—against humans. Though previously banned at the close of the war, the practice of the onmyoji—masters of spirits and divination—has been approved once again in order to combat the ongoing supernatural threat. With hollow souls roaming the streets of Tokyo freely, the world is on the brink of collapsing into chaos. While it has been discovered that most of these malicious spirits were once human, the dark truth behind the origin of these disturbing transformations has yet to reveal itself. Only by resolving these strange incidents in this metropolis of turbulent, clashing emotions will the answers eventually be made clear... Or will they? CHARACTERS CREDITS Production: Holicworks, inc.
