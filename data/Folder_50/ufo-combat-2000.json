    "About the game": "UFO Combat 2000 is actually an arcade game in a twin stick shooter style, it's simple but fun. What you just need to do is try to destroy as much enemies as you can and score. Please note that there is any complex mechanic or an fantastic innovation in the game world, at least yet. What I want with this game is to make it better with time, and add new features as receive feedback from the community. From now, expect a simple game with simple gameplay for simple time killing. OBS: Please notice that there's no minimum or recommended specs available for the game, that's because i don't know them yet. Let me know if the game is lagging on your PC, send me the specs and i will be performing some tweaks to optimize the game as best as I can.",
