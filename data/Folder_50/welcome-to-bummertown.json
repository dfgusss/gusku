    "About the game": "This is the developers of Think Inside the Box writing a cry for help. Our beloved game character, an experienced doctor and farming enthusiast, Bedford went missing. He was last seen by a woozy cow at his farm (located in the lovely place of Bummertown), raking dead rats on his porch. - The red circle marks the spot where Bedford was last seen. Ignore the upside-down bird, it’s not a glitch, only a photographic illusion. This is what the cow had to say: 'Yeah I saw him, standing there in front of his hut raking something. When all of a sudden the usual glitch* occurred that pushed Bedford's rake out of his hands and into the sky. All I remember after that was Bedford's red face, his barrage of curses, and him walking into the woods.' *We, as the developers of the wonderful Bummertown, do not agree with said statement. There are no glitches in this town. - The cow that saw it all (not the glitches though, as there are none). We are searching for brave souls who are willing to go head first into what maybe a dangerous* journey.** *In reality, it won’t actually impose any danger to the player at all. **Technically, it’s more of a task than a journey. If you think you have what it takes to find Bedford, then it’s likely you’ll have to do the following: Collect items and use them as needed. Talk to imbecilic characters. T̶a̶l̶k̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶i̶n̶t̶e̶l̶l̶i̶g̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶c̶h̶a̶r̶a̶c̶t̶e̶r̶s̶.̶ Solve puzzles. Talk to animals. Start a bar fight. Search for treasure. Watch an old lady dance in a bikini. As creators of Bummertown, we can confirm that it is a magnificent place, filled with joy and happy faces everywhere you look; it’s a digital heaven. You’ll most certainly enjoy your visit. Also, there are no glitches anywhere in Bummertown, everything works fine and dandy. Yup… In order to find Bedford, you’ll also need some information regarding his appearance: Name: Dr. Bedford. Weight: 30 kB. Height: 28 px. Width: 15 px. Outline: 2 px. Eyes: Black. Hair: Balding, has some gray patches on the back of his head. Unique signs: Smells like a combination of dirty socks and expired meat. -Some recent photos of Bedford. If you manage to find him or have gathered any valuable information, please let us know in the comment section below. THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP!",
