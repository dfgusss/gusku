    "About the game": "Tear through the skies over clear blue seas in a breezy short-form arcade action game inspired by an old fave of mine. Rescue the peeps! Collect the crates! We don't know why or what's even in them but hey, they're beeping so they must be good, right? But be sure to check your 6, as ufos, deadly storms and the Reckless Endangerment Display Squad are all out to ruin your day. Well they've got nothing against you personally tbh, but they're kind of careless, reckless or An Actual Force Of Nature so y'know. Videogames! Potentially infuriating control system whether you're using keys or a gamepad! Seriously it's like flying a little RC heli or something Chipper synth-poppy soundtrack Cutesy pixel art nonsense 'Chill' mode for when you just want to bop around in a little chopper",
