Item wear and tear Items might get broken from use, from getting old, from absorbing hits. Different materials have different fragility. Also, Items lying on ground get old and turn into shatters. Crafting The game features simple crafting system where you can choose which weapons your characters will craft for themselves. If not, characters will go and craft basic weapons. there are 4 resources (wood, stone, metal, cloth) which are gathered automatically but you can prioritize certain resources, or character making, over others. Logs Every character in Epicia has logs attached which includes his deeds, all combat activities, injuries. Damnation It's possible for all kings in Epicia to become damned by killing creatures (as opposed to injuring them but letting live). Damned kings can't craft but their units get strength bonus, and the only way for them is to conquer others. Quests Player is given quests to obtain items, or kill a certain beast. If quest giver is eliminated, the quest becomes unavailable.
