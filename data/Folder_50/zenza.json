    "About the game": "'Time progresses, and the seasons change. The wind blows us towards new hope, new life, new goals. An aching loss left behind. A new blossom, a new beginning.' Zenza is a calming yet strategic puzzle game taking the player on a journey through the seasons. Put colors or shapes together to achieve balance. Progress through 80 increasingly challenging levels to perfect your zen. Leaves, blossoms, or snow may fall. There's always a chance to start anew. Zenza is based off of Kigo Haiku, a form of Japanese poems thematically relating to the seasons. Play through the four seasons: Spring - The Cherry Tree (Sakura) Blooms Summer - The Bonsai is Trimmed in Rainy Season Fall - The Momiji Maple Leaves Fall Winter - The Oak Tree is covered in Snow Zenza is a 'no fail' game; you can slice your unwanted tiles away, blow away your deck of tiles with the wind or undo a move at will. Be aware that if you do, your score may suffer in the end. Zenza allows you to use your wits and will to create your perfect game board. Featuring a dynamic 2D lighting system and an original soundtrack. Draw your moves with the calligraphy pen to create a swirling masterpiece.",
