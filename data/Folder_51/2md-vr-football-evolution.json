    "About the game": "More than 200 years have passed since the bombs fell, and the last vestiges of humanity were summarily and brutally wiped from existence. Long after the cities stopped burning, and the toxic clouds of fallout had swept across the landscape washing life clean from the world once known as Earth, the dummies continued to play their game of gridiron football . Over the decades, as the tackle-dummies perfected their game, they too began to evolve and to change; once they had been satisfied bouncing about ineffectually on the football fields of old, but as time drove relentlessly onward they gradually began to adapt, utilizing the now silent tools of war that drove their progenitors to their ultimate destruction. In time, they fashioned for themselves a new existence birthed from the ashes of a world long dead. Clad now in aluminum and steel where once there was only vinyl and fabric, the players continue their game. Draped in the names and colors of teams whose meanings were already long lost to the ashes of time. And still the play. A thousand metal fists raised in unison in a cold, heartless chorus of servos and motors rising like an iron phoenix from the rusted carcass of the world. Their singular purpose now hard-coded into the soulless metal forms that carry them onto the field day after darkened day, driven by the same singular binary command that has fueled their gridiron obsession from the days before the world was dead: 01110100 01110111 01101111 00100000 01101101 01101001 01101110 01110101 01110100 01100101 00100000 01100100 01110010 01101001 01101100 01101100...
