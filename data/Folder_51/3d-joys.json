    "About the game": "3D Joys is more of a utility and is short for 3D Joysticks. It's called that because it's based on Joysticks used in arcades. 3D Joys allow the player to go 6 different directions instead of 4 directions like from a regular Joystick with the help of VR controllers. The player can summon their 3d Joystick at the position of their hand by using the grip button and choosing from up, down, right, left, forward or backwards. Testing their hand eye coordination. VR Memory Cube is the first addition to 3D Joys. Test your memory and maybe possibly improve it with a color remembering game like the classic Simon game. Basically, the game is to remember a sequence of colors on a cube while each side of the cube will light up different colors that will resemble your 3D Joystick. Online Leaderboard has been implemented for the people that want to show off. Offline Leaderboard is also an option. Oculus Rift is the only VR headset I tested this game on. The future of 3D Joys will depend on its growth because there is only one person working on this project which is myself and I am a college dropout student with a Digital Arts Media Certificate. I started working on this project when I had my first Computer Programing class, where I learned Python and which made me pursue other programming languages like C#. Unity is the engine that I am using to make this game. I am not a professional. I try as hard as I can to bring my vision for this game into fruition and it may take longer than someone that knows what they're doing but I hope you see the potential and come along the ride that is 3D Joys. @WhoDisz",
