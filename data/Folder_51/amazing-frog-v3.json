    "About the game": "Welcome to the land of SwindonShire, home of the flatulent superhero Amazing Frog? Join Amazing Frog? and his fellow Swindon residents and explore this open world buffet of bonkers physics sandbox…ness. Take a Tour of a Lovely UK Location Hop around Swindon and take in the sights and sounds. This city has everything your frog could possibly dream of. Grab your morning joe at Frog Milk Coffee, stretch your legs at the fully fitted fart gym or take a drive by the seaside. The world is your frogster…er, oyster. Toadally Wild Mayhem Ever wondered what frogs get up to in their spare time? There are loads of different items to interact with in the game including (but not limited to): balloons, tanks, eggs, weapons and sports balls (YAY SPORTS). And if none of that appeals to you, you can always shoot yourself out of cannon just to feel the wind on your froggy face. Be One With Nature Frogs aren’t the only ones getting up to no good in Swindon. Search around town and you might just come across a muddy pig waiting to be ridden. How about a nice, friendly race with some friends? If you’ve got more exotic tastes, the tourism board of Swindon recommends NOT going into the sewers. (We are not part of the tourism board and, therefore, heavily encourage it.) Welcome to Swindon Fellow Amphibians What’s the fun of riding pigs with saddles or taking a dive at the gym pool without friends? Thankfully, Amazing Frog? invited all of his buds to Swindon and you can too. Amazing Frog? offers four player local multiplayer and four player remote play. It’s not easy being green, but it’s easy to play Amazing Frog? with friends.",
