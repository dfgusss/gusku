Navigation, stealth, shooting, interactions ; you play it all by ear (literally). A recent accident has left you blind, unable to speak, and with no memory of your former self. “We are here to help” whispers a voice softly, yet something feels off. In a twisted stroke of luck, your fate is tied to that of a dubious stranger. All you know is that something far more ominous is lurking around every corner you can't see.
