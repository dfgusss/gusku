    "Release date": "Oct 6, 2020",
    "About the game": "Message from the developer: Well, no more screwing around. It's time for the full NSFW game! There are two descriptions waiting for you down below. One is short, and the other one contains all the interesting details. I hope you’ll enjoy our (PixelGreeds + HarDDeer) game! Inspired by anime like 'Golden Boy', I decided to make a game about a bad magician, but a good person, who by the will of fate gets into different funny and sometimes dangerous situations. You're a Spellbreaker. And in order to 'break' the Arcane fever, you have to understand its cause. To do that, you need to get all the information you can, study the area, and find the right approach to a patient. Duration: The average duration of Season 1 is around 4-5 hours. My goal was to make the game packaged with maximum content, and at the same time to avoid artificially stretching the gameplay, by NOT including such things as: grind, pixel hunting, rare CGIs, etc. You play as an unskilled magician who helps people curing them from the mysterious and dangerous 'Arcane fever'. Unlike other 'Spellbreakers', you do not know how to feel magic, so your approach is a little different from the traditional. On your journey you'll come across a lot of different girls with their unique personalities, problems, wishes and fetishes. In any endeavor, it is important to understand when to be calm, gentle and neat, and when to be assertive, confident, and even a little aggressive. The right choice of runes will allow you to succeed not only in magic, but also in love. ;) -Comics/manga style. H-scenes are an interactive comic book that requires using runes and different items. -Girls 70+ unique panels. And 150+ total CGIs. -Dialogues: The text and the story are very important parts of the game. You'll have to properly asses the situation and choose the right solution. Characters depicted in this game are 21 years of age or older.",
