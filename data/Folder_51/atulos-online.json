    "About the game": "Atulos Online is a free to play 2D medieval MMORPG. You can choose from many different characters including Mage, Knight, Dwarf and Guardian. The story unfolds as a confrontation with the sorcerer Atulos draws ever closer. In the Ancient times, a fearsome ruler in the line of Arkahron ruled with an iron fist. This ruler was called Atulos, because in the Ancient tongue this meant that he was both wise and evil. Atulos used his wisdom to study the dark arts, a gift that according to legend, was sometimes found in the lineage of Arkahron. Atulos awoke many a great and terrible force, and became more powerful than any other that has lived. Atulos conquered all the lands of the Ancient world, and ruled them for many years. But Atulos was not immortal. During a war with a band of mountain dwelling rebels, Atulos was struck in the neck by an arrow. Nearing death, Atulos retreated to his castle. There he died and was placed in a burial chamber that became enchanted by powers still unknown. Over the centuries the region was named after its ancient ruler... Atulos.",
