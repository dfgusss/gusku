    "About the game": "Axe Girl is an action platformer where you play as Axela, a young lumberjack who lost her sawmill after a mysterious meteorite disaster. Help her rebuild it by collecting the 6 power cells she needs to run it again. Fight, run, and bounce your way through fearsome foes and perilous obstacles! Features: Classic combat focused platformer gameplay. 6 unique levels. 7 boss fights, all of which have their own boss themes. 4 difficulty settings that can be changed at any time for added ax-essibility. (Haha, get it?) Boss rush mode. Awesome soundtrack. A speedrun timer, just in case you're in a hurry. A talking tree.",
