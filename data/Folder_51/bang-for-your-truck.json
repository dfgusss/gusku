    "About the game": "Bang For Your Truck is a chaotic vehicular combat game in which you pilot a highly mobile, acrobatic battle truck. Perform out of this world stunts and trick shots as you traverse the map, collect kill tokens and claim total victory (and bragging rights) over your friends! There are multiple mounted weapons in your arsenal including long-range cannons and close quarters shotguns, and many throwable devices available for purchase. These include: ○ Homing Missiles that hunt down your opponents. ○ Particle Turrets that bombard the enemy. ○ Landmines for strong area control. ○ EMP grenades to immobilise your enemy. With many more to come! Choose from unique maps such as: ○ Grid Gulch, our simple yet action packed original map. ○ Caverns, a confined space with many pillars allowing you to transition to the ceiling. ○ Valleys, a multilevel map with many points of engagement. ○ With more coming... While players duke it out, our Drone, Skipper, will be televising the events to the audience while also displaying his video feed on massive screens around the arena. He prioritises the best performing players, but don't worry! If you feel someone is getting too much of the spotlight, don't hesitate to target Skipper and take him down from the sky!",
