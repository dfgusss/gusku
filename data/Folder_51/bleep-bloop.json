    "About the game": "Meet Bleep and Bloop as they help each other overcome all the challenges that stand in their way. A light-hearted and playful puzzle game about working together. Play alone controlling both characters or share the experience with a friend. Bleep Bloop is extremely easy to learn, but that doesn't mean the puzzles will be a piece of cake. - Enough levels to keep you entertained during a lazy Sunday, but not enough to make you wish the game had ended already. - Beautiful soundtrack that makes getting stuck on a level a bit less painful. - Perfect for single-player or two-player coop. Yelling at each other doesn't improve your puzzle-solving skills, but it's always fun. - Features a small secret hidden somewhere. Go look for it.",
