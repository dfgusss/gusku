    "About the game": "As the Chrono Ghost, you have the responsibility of proving yourself to the Spirit of Time. You also seek the truth to some unanswered questions. How did you end up here? Why are you the Chrono Ghost? Who or what is the Spirit of Time? Why are you chosen to complete the Spirit of Time’s test? The Chrono Ghost game mechanics are one of a kind. As the Chrono Ghost you have the power to speed up, slow down, and stop time. These abilities will only work on certain objects depending on color. This game tests your dexterity, reaction speed, timing, and overall ability to react to and overcome the continuous flow of obstacles. The game gets much more difficult in later levels. This is a game about precise timing. Are you up for the challenge? Note: 'Full Controller Support' outside of initial launcher where you can adjust resolution and quality",
