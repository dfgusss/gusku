    "About the game": "Clarity of the soul is a psychological horror from the first person, where attention is paid to the study of objects and the challenge of fear in the player. This is a story about the main character who was on the side of justice and bravery, which inadvertently led to a sentence of 12 years in prison. At the end of the term, the hero returned home, but there was no one to wait for him and he will have to partially return to his former life. At night, the hero is overtaken by nightmares that remind him of what happened earlier, so the task remains - to end the past, cope with stress and move on. The main part of the player will have to explore the old house in which the hero previously lived, but everything in the house is not as calm and rosy as before, and at night the player is haunted by nightmares of the past, from which the player needs to get out so as not to stay in it forever. The player's task in the game is to fulfill daily household obligations around the house, and at night - not to come face to face with their worst nightmares.",
