    "About the game": "The strongest wizard of the cosmos has been cast into the unknown by a mythical power. Traveling amongst the stars seeking knowledge- specifically new spells to master- he came across a time loop in the middle of the universe and now is stuck, in an endless loop. His enemies found a way into this loop and now he must protect himself. Unfortunately for him, this loop has caused his memories of all the spells he has learned to diminish, forced to wait and see what his enemies use against him and copy those spells to use to defend himself. Heavily inspired by Rubick, a playeable hero from the game Dota 2. You are tasked with defeating endless waves of enemy warlocks that want to kill you, wait for them to use a spell and then steal it and use it on them. Key features: Different levels inspired by pop culture - From Norse mythology to Lord of the Rings inspired maps, avoid falling off the edge in the chaos of spellcasting madness. Punishing dodge &amp; spellcasting based combat system - Very fast phased gameplay, as time passes, enemies get stronger and more of them come at you, fortunately all your spells are AoE. Very different spells - Arcane bolt, piano, frostbite, impale, blink, icicle, solar slash, reflect, boomerang, brambles and morph are currently all in the game with more to come. Never ending madness - There is no time limit to this, you can play for hours if you can last it. Leaderboards - Compare your scores with your friends or globally. Customization - Unlock cosmetics and make your magus look awesome! Achievements - Collect them after finishing the many different challenges the game has to offer. Spells: Arcane Bolt - Shoots a arcane ball at the mouse position disintegrating whatever enemy comes in contact with it. Frostbite - After a 2 second delay, spikes will raise up from the ground at the mouse position and kill/freeze whatever comes in contact with them. Icicle - Shoots an icicle at the mouse position that drags the first unit it connects with and kills whatever other units it collides with afterwards, if it hits a wall, the impaled unit dies. Blink - Teleports the player to the mouse position instantly. Impale- Shoots a wave of impaling crystals in forward direction from the player towards the mouse position. Piano - Throws a piano up in the sky that arcs and lands at the mouse position after a 1.5s delay. Solar Slash - After a short channel, you move forward real fast and disintegrate enemies that collide with you. Reflect - When timed correctly it reflects projectiles towards the mouse position. Boomerang - Shoots a projectile on an arc that returns to the player and kills whatever it collides with. Brambles - Vector targeted, creates brambles on an area that slows down whenever you are within it's radius. Morph - Transforms you into a random object. Content is constantly being added to the game.",
