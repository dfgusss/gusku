Each of us on the team are college graduates who were fortunate enough to receive funding to continue development after graduation in 2021. We were all determined to create an experience that authentically represents Brooklyn, as well as the experience of code-switching. We hope that playing our game helps shed new light on how code-switching may impact your life or the lives of those around you. Thank you! - Team baconeggandcheese About the Game Crown Delights Deli is a visual novel with multiple dialect/language choices. As the cashier at a Brooklyn bodega, choose to talk in English, AAVE, or Spanish to a diverse cast of characters as you try to maintain a five-star rating for your boss.

Talk in Spanish to the Hipster who is trying to practice their Spanish or chat with your classmate Gian in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Features Authentic Brooklyn experience Subtle but impactful choices through code-switching 10 diverse characters from Brooklyn to interact with Cute and colorful art Delightful and original soundtrack",
