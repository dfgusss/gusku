    "About the game": "Welcome, wanderer! Dark Tower is a deadly dungeon of death room exploration in which every move counts. Your quest is to puzzle your way to the very top of the tower by unlocking doors using a limited number of keys. Face dangerous enemies such as goblins, skeletons, mages, vampires, and more! Use keys wisely. Every level of the tower is a sort of labyrinth where your priority is to upgrade the character. It is vital. The puzzle is brutal. Prepare yourself to star over and over again, countless times! So sharpen a sword, snatch a shield and face the challenge of the Dark Tower! This game is not for the faint of heart.",
