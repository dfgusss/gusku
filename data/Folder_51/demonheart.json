    "Name": "Demonheart",
    "Release date": "Mar 24, 2017",
    "About the game": "Female protagonist. Over 100.000 words of conversations and hundreds of dialog choices. Friendships, romances or love-hate relationships. Custom alignment system measured by two scales: Good/Evil and Tactful/Defiant. A journal that gets filled with world lore. Intrigue and betrayal. A demon talking in your head. Selected lines are voiced over. Bright is a young woman from a small, peaceful town. Dark times have come for her family, but luckily, she has the favor of the famous healer-witch Orchid. Benevolent, calm and beloved by all, Orchid hides dark secrets that Bright begins to uncover. Bright is drawn into a world of darkness and treachery. It seems she can never be alone again - for a powerful demonic presence has taken an interest in her activities, and his voice enters her mind at the most inappropriate times. There are also others who play a significant role in Bright's new life... Ari, a young apprentice witch seduced by bad influences. She tries to be friendly, even though she knows Bright is meant to be her enemy... or is she? And Sir Brash, a notorious evil knight who develops a soft spot for Bright, but has a rather special way of showing affection. 'Where are the games with dark storytelling and evil men, and why is it taboo for women to fantasize about them? Demonheart wisely accommodates this void with a cast of evil love interests and a thought-provoking dark narrative.' - ReMeDy 'There's a certain level of role play involved in playing visual novels - I want to make their personality how I imagine, and choose responses I want, instead of being forced to make what the game developer wanted. Demonheart is masterful at this.' - pinky 'A visual novel that you will never forget and that will make you return to it again and again to explore all the choices, to see all the scenes and to love, hate and desire.' - futaba-tian",
