    "About the game": "Do you remember minesweeper? Back in the days people spent countless hours trying to clear out the blocks, now it is your turn to accomplish the feat! Downbreak is a risk management puzzle game about finding out an optimal path toward the end, clicking the right crates clearing up your way. But beware - this time the crates will fall! Wrong choices will lead to your doom. Make your way to the bottom! An unknown treasure lies in the depths of a forgotten realm and you are determined to solve the ancient riddle to bring home the treasure with you. Downbreak is all about breaking crates, placing flags and descending to the lowest point of the level. Get rewarded by your risk management skills, trade your gold and customize your magic items inventory; try your luck and fortune on the many random mini-games you will encounter along your way and prepare for the unexpected challenges that await you! Game Features: Campaign mode: Experience over 300 levels of almighty mine-sweeping challenges carefully distributed through six different episodes, featuring an array of varying game mechanics along the entire journey. Inventory system: Buy and earn a collection of powerful magic items to complete your strategy or simply to escape “those” moments when the odds are against you. Refreshing mini-games: Special events will occasionally appear as you descend through the levels, depending on how well the task is performed you will be rewarded with several different prizes to boost up your chances of successfully beating the campaign towers. Unlockable game modes: Enjoy the lifelong classic minesweeper mode with its countless level variations and layouts, pull your hair out in the difficult challenge mode and spend hours to make it to the farthest ends in the infinite mode. Online leaderboards: Compete with your friends for the throne! Every single action in Downbreak counts toward the final score; master your own play-style and game mode to be at the top of the online leaderboards! Optional graphic modes: Choose the in-game graphic style which makes you feel more comfortable. If lots of details are overwhelming to you or you are prone to eye strain, choosing the basic tile set templates will turn the gaming session into a delightful experience for you. Are you up for the challenge?",
