    "About the game": "Ellisar is an underwater adventure in a corrupted world. Your character will be able to explore the ocean using two kinds of bodies: a humanoid one and stingray-like one. With the help of your small but magic Mooty friends you will be able to soar through the devastated areas your species used to inhabit. Unique movement Your character can change its form to be able to move like a stingray. Using the magical power of the Mooties around you, you can flap your fins to impulse yourself forward. You can do this as many times as you have Mooties, but they have to rest, so you will need to transform back whenever their power has worn off. Contemplative exploration The world around you is both magical and devastated. While looking for the solution to the corruption, you will encounter many things that will shed a light to the history of your ancestors. A living environment Life finds a way. Even if everything around you seems hopeless, there's always life that can give you the push you need to continue. Our world is filled with small animals and algae that reminds the player of how necessary it is to continue this venture and prevent the disaster from spreading.
