Story It is the year 2100, and a dangerous criminal has infected through a virus the military computer systems around the world. This virus was created to sabotage military systems and to launch nuclear warheads to the world's major cities, then humanity is in danger! To resolve this crisis, it was created an anti-virus, Energy Hunter Boy, which has the task of identifying and disabling infected groups of memory of various military systems. The small robot anti-virus will be able to save the world? Best features Procedural levels All levels are procedurally generated, therefore missions and dynamics will always be different and unpredictable.! Awesome scenarios Cartoon style graphics with natural elements mixed with mechanical components. Objects collection and transport It will be possible to collect the 'health' items and put them in the backpack of our hero, and then transport them to the extraction point. Multiple campaigns The game is divided into three main campaigns in addition to an endless unlockable campaign. Each campaign represents a type of system to be deactivated! Great and full storytelling The complete story of the game is divided into chapters and fragments, and it will be completely told during the main campaigns! More fantastic features - procedural voxel terrains - terrain modeling, voxel creation and destruction - procedural vegetation - procedural trees - procedural fluids (water and toxic fluids) - enclosures for generators to improve gameplay - optimized gameplay with selective deactivations - resources extraction (Vigor points from vegetation!) Voxel worlds The scenarios are generated with voxel technology, and even the vegetation, trees and plants are always generated randomly. By this way the scenarios will always be different, fascinating and modifiable at will. In fact by gathering energy you can activate the 'terrain tool' that allows you to dig or build the land at will, to achieve the objectives of the missions. Furthermore, by digging the ground, it is possible to obtain resources from the vegetation (Vigor points)! There are also procedural sources of fluids that can also be toxic and lethal! Enjoy the journey, the exploration and the fighting! Gameplay The aim of the game is to collect and extract the the number of health objects required to pass the level. To do this you must go in 'deactivation mode' to deactivate the selected power generator, then the 'health' items will be created. You have to collect and bring home these items. To enter in 'deactivation mode' and to deform the ground you need ENERGY . This energy can be earned by collecting the many bonuses that appear every time you kill an enemy! The energy decreases every second. You have to take also the VIGOR objects to increase AMMO and AUTONOMY of the little robot. Energy! Energy is fundamental in this game. Through the energy it is possible to deactivate the power generators to overcome the levels, it is possible to use the 'terrain tool' to deform the ground at will and reach all the places of the scenario, it is possible to dig and destroy the vegetation to collect the ' Vigor ' necessary for our little robot! In other words, you will be a true ENERGY HUNTER ! You will have to destroy as many enemies as possible to collect energy bonuses.",
