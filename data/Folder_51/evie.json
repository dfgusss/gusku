    "About the game": "/ / / / / / A girl crashed into a dark forest not knowing where to go, curiosity drives her to open a Pandora’s box that was never meant to be opened. Evie is a short first-person horror narrative that unfolds a mind-boggling event, set in the middle of an eerie forest that was left undiscovered for good reasons. The story starts off by reading diaries left in an abandoned house by a lady named Evie. As a player, you will quickly realize that great tragedies hit her life and uncontrollably fell into a downward spiral of despair. This game was a 3 months project made by Yasuka Taira (me) and Kensuke Hayashi (HS student and a student of mine.) Kensuke helped me write the story (diaries and documents.) I did all the visuals and designing. Shoutout to everyone who's helped us :D Due to my work and Kensuke's school, we were only working on it for 3 hours a day. Some days we just wanted to take a rest :P Unfortunately, we didn't have a programmer so the game might not be perfect, but we believe we did our best to make it happen. Hope you enjoy it :D DISCLAIMERS: This game might contain disturbing scenes. The characters do not reflect person's life.",
