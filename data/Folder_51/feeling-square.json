    "About the game": "This game is hard; back to the basics of pixel graphics, the goal of the game is to reach the end of the level. You will die over and over again learning the in and out's of the levels. How long will you take? Can you beat the game with your sanity still intact? The Game will continue to be updated the more it is out, so you can expect levels upon levels with time. You play as three cubes of all different sizes. You use them to complete puzzles to make it to the end of the level. For people that like it easy, you can complete the game by only getting one of the three cubes to the end, but if you want a real challenge you can get all the cubes to the end for the true ending. Update 2.0 our biggest update yet is update 2.0. We weren't happy with the state of the game, so we redid the entire game from start to finish. We added a load of new features and gameplay elements to make your gaming experience even better. Here are is a list of what we added: Added new movement, so no more buggy movement when colliding with another cube. Added 10+ new songs to listen to while trying to complete the levels. Added a Map Editor that allows you to create and share your amazing levels. Added achievements, so now you have something to work towards. Added hardcore, and a casual difficulty for people to play. All boss battles have been reworked. We are super excited to be relaunching the game, and we hope to make you guys have a fun, difficult, enjoyable experience for days to come. We are also working with the community to add new features and fix bugs, we want this game to be something all people can play.",
