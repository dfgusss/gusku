    "About the game": "It's the vacation you've been waiting for! You and your buddy have the keys to their uncle's cabin up in the mountains near the best lake you've ever fished at! The ecology has seemed to change since you've last been there though, and the uncle is no where to be found... but don't let that stop you from reeling in a big one! Fishing Vacation is an homage to Gameboy games of the past. The game is part fishing adventure, part atmospheric horror with a good dose of humor. Over the span of 3 days you'll dig up your own worms and catch your own dinner as you uncover the mysteries of the vacant cabin and the whereabouts of your friend's uncle and their family. The game features: -Over 30 types of fish and creatures to catch -A humorously horrific story -3+ endings (Roughly 30 mins to an hour per playthrough) -10+ color palettes to choose from -CONTROLS- A and B are Z and X on the keyboard. A controller is recommended to play.",
