    "Release date": "May 16, 2020",
    "About the game": "FOS is a game where the world will change over and over again reacting to your every action. This is a game where you will start playing a at first every time, but following a different storyline. This is a game where every move you make affects the game and you can't change it. This is a game where you can die from an ordinary pebble, but at the same time you can kill an ancient fire dragon alone... This is a game where you will find 100 fun and at the same time intriguing endings. You don't like the hero's path? Kill all the game NPS in the game and become the most wanted criminal. Don't like the robber's way? So become a merchant by killing him, and then take over his shop! Don't want to be a merchant? So go to hell straight to the threshold of the LORD of the UNDERWORLD, perform all his orders, and then just kill him. It's so easy, isn't it? Don't want to be a trader, neither a hero nor a bandit, nor the killer of the demon? So find the Kingdom of your king, and then break into his doorstep cut out all his guards, slam the door in the king's face, and just stick a sword in him, getting his crown and power over the whole Kingdom in your hands. But be careful with great power comes great responsibility or whatever it is. After playing the wonderful game Reventure, we found ourselves thinking why not do something similar but with their own ideas, capabilities and other implementation In this game you need to explore a huge world, destroy monsters and influence the world around you. You can finish this game with one of the many game plots. And also you will find a huge number of game characters and interesting items. Here you don't have to follow the story of the game, you're not some dirty farmer, right? And for whom did this pathetic, boring, and generally unbearable story come up, because you don't always have to follow it right? In General, everything is in your hands go to meet the adventures!!!",
