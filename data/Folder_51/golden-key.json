    "About the game": "Do you think that officials are greedy and corrupt fools? Congratulations, now you are one of them. You are an official whose daughter was suddenly and deadly sick and needs money for treatment. Will you save your daughter and become a hero for her, or will you be a hero for your people? Or you will become so narcissistic and indiferent that you will be hated by everyone and everything, and perhaps you will even be put in jail. Everything is in your hands - the fate of your people, your daughter and your own fate, who you will become, is up to you! The job of an official - people with different requests will come to you every day - from helping to open your own point of a point to helping sponsoring secret companies. You need to keep a balance between refusal and keeping your budget with reputation. The “Nation Loyalty” system: the “better” you deal with the problems of people - the more you will get love and adoration from people, but your budget may become empty from such help. Always keep track of your budget. Choose someone competent to help you. You still have your own interests - a sick daughter who needs a cure. Bribes - not every person leaves after refusal, he can offer you a bribe, and then you have to decide The Revolutionary faction is almost insane, they always stand up for the oppressed and robbed people! You displease them – you get out of your post, or even get killed. The game has more than 10 endings. Your choices influence what is happening, if you reduce the nation loyalty or expel a revolutionary from your office - your life will shine with new colors.",
