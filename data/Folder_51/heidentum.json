    "About the game": "In Heidentum you play against up to 3 other players in online matches, strategy is the focus point of the game, the way the game flows makes sure you always use different strategies, some reasons down below. - The landscape and environment are totally randomized every game, its procedural generated so the combinations are basically infinite. - The neutral creatures have all base stats plus a random value that make's them sometimes stronger and other times weaker. - Your unit's speciality are randomized, so you have to adapt your strategy to fit what you get. - Each Paganism have different Strength's and Weakness, so the gameplay differ's from each other. Mixing those you get infinite possibilities in games, that's done to let players use their wisdom at full capacity, not blocking them to certain strategies.",
