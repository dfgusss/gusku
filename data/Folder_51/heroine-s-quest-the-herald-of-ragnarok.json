    "About the game": "Explore the rich world of Nordic mythology! Egther, last of the Frost Giants, has sworn to turn all the world to ice. A young heroine is called to fight him, but first she must survive the harsh environment, battle hostile trolls, and deal with many creatures and characters from the classic myths. Heroine's Quest: The Herald of Ragnarok is an adventure / RPG hybrid. Like in many adventure games, you have a world to save, and must use your wit, guile and inventory to puzzle your way through. Like in many roleplaying games, you can customize your character with various classes and skills, and must train yourself in combat to stand a chance against the fierce monsters in your way. Each class has her own solution to the numerous obstacles, where the warrior is the most straightforward to play, the sorceress focuses on smart solutions and finding the right spell for the situation, and the rogue cheats her way through life without getting caught. The game is designed in the spirit and atmosphere of the classics, and strives to have the same high quality of art, music, and plot. With multiple character classes and several solutions to many puzzles, there are plenty of options for further replayability. The game has been voted voted 69th All-Time Best Computer RPG by RpgCodex. It is available completely for free, or as we like to call it, priceless. 'The attention to detail is staggering ... Heroine’s Quest is a glorious adventure-RPG hybrid.' - RockPaperShotgun 'As perfect a tribute to Sierra's classic Quest for Glory series as you could hope for.' Kotaku 'It's great to see a female-centric heroic quest.' - Corey Cole 'I was still discovering new quests and things to do even on a third playthrough.' - Last Token",
