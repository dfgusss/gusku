    "About the game": "Idol Quest VR is a single-player exploration-adventure shooter with a simple premise: Discover the lost idol. To do so you will need to solve puzzles and avoid or defend yourself against dangerous wildlife and other perils in large, open environments. Both natural (arm-swing plus head-bob) and artificial locomotion play styles are supported, and you are free to run, swim, and climb as you please. You are supplied with a knife, a backpack (for storing various pickupables), dual pistols, dual uzis (on some levels), 92 rounds of pistol ammo, a pump-action shotgun, and 18 rounds of shotgun ammo; all weapons handling is detailed and takes full advantage of vr motion controllers. Each level has its secrets, including four randomly placed crystals. Will you discover them all? Will you survive to find the idol? Note for Oculus Rift users: Ensure you launch the game from your Steam Library and choose the second option, 'Launch Oculus Rift in Oculus VR Mode'. Alternatively, launch idolquestvr_oculusrift.exe, which for most people will be located at the following path: Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Idol Quest VR\\oculusrift\\idolquestvr_oculusrift.exe",
