    "About the game": "LOOPS + MOMENTUM . The game is the result of a design exploration that follows this basic rule and tries to create as many interesting situations as possible, all other elements follow that same base and create a unique and elegant experience for the player. ITL is about manipulating momentum to traverse levels. You can play it casually in the Zen Mode (no timers and no scores) or try to complete the levels as fast as possible and beat your best time. Besides all the 100+ hand-crafted levels, you can explore the Endless Mode with procedurally generated levels for infinite hours of play. No hold-hands annoying tutorials, no locks, no powerups, nothing artificially gating your progress, just start a level and find the best pathway to the portal. What Into the Loop Offers Unique momentum-based platformer Engaging mechanics High replay value Strawberries for an extra challenge (catch them all for bragging rights) What Into the Loop does NOT offer Violence Guns Lootboxes Multiplayer Microtransactions A helpless princess to be saved I created the first version of Into The Loop for the Ludum Dare 47 game jam. The game was made in 48 hours having the theme 'Stuck in a loop'. After receiving very positive feedback from the community and ranking 11th place in the jam, I decided to expand it and give it a try on Steam. One year has passed and here we are... This is my first commercial project and would be AWESOME if you give it a try. :) Thanks!",
