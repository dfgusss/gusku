    "About the game": "Junkpunk Arena takes place in a desolate future, in the anarcho-capitalist society of “New Braska.” Within this society, pollution has taken over the land, and corrupt corporations rule over the people. But the people have taken advantage of their surroundings and have crafted a potential path out of this dreadful situation, a competition known as the Arc of Action. Participants build robots from the junk that surrounds them and then pit them against each other in various contests, the most popular of which are “robot death matches.” By participating in the Arc of Action, the player character and their allies can rise up from the dregs of society and challenge the corruption that has taken hold of everything. Build! Utilize various pieces of junk to create crazy robotic creations to use in online play! Battle! Test your “metal” against your friends in wild online battles! Who’s robot will reign supreme? Eggs with Legs is a team of 12 from Champlain College that created this game as a senior capstone project. Our team consisted of 4 designers, 3 artists, 3 programmers, and 2 producers. The entirety of development was done remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought several challenges and encouraged creative solutions and fixes. Junkpunk Arena is a testament to all of our hard work throughout our 4 year journey here. Junkpunk Forever!",
