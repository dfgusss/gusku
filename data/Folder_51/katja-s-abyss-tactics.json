    "About the game": "The Story 'Hey, I'm Katja.' 'So you're the captain they just promoted at Echo Mining Corp, yeah? Listen, you've got the task of leading our crew of brave miners and engineers into the dangerous caves of Montmane. Your goal is to collect potent runoff from volatile Nodes of energy in the walls. This mountain has a mysterious history, though, and you'll be pivotal in my research. Creatures native to the caves have been warped by the powerful energy in them, so watch your back. For my sake, I'm here to study them!' Gameplay Scan the walls to find safe spots to dig with mining units. Build combat units to attack and defend against monsters that lurk in the caves. Collect energy from the cave walls to build new units and complete the level. Make tactical use of each unit's unique abilities and modification options. Katja's Abyss: Tactics has Campaign and Infinite modes. In Campaign Mode, there are 8 sequential levels with a connecting story. Infinite Mode tests your skills in Normal and Deadly difficulties. See how deep you can get! In the caves, you'll find Artifacts while digging or fighting monsters. Open the extras menu to read more about these Artifacts and learn about the ancient people whose ruins are left behind in these caves!
