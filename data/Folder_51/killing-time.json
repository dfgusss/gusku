    "Release date": "Dec 15, 2016",
    "About the game": "A sophisticated shooter laced with gallows humor. Killing Time is no shallow grave. Its depth is well-conceived. Puzzle solving and strategic thinking are placed at a premium. The visceral violence is complimented by paranormal graphics and a super(natural) storyline. Killing Time is a fright-fest for the true aficionado of first-person corridor mayhem. OST in MP3 format is included! (Check inside the folder called 'Bonus') Features: Listen to the remembrances of the 7 video-real apparitions and ghostly guests. They offer clues as to what past heinous acts actually transpired in the cursed mansion. Look up and down - turn around with a complete 360 view. The three-dimensional mansion offers outdoor areas, staircases and intricately detailed ceilings and floors. The original music makes this old haunt strongly inviting, eh? But beware. Every room, every passage in the estate holds dreadful dangers. Enjoy continuous gameplay with no load time between areas.",
