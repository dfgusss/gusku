    "About the game": "Game features: 1.As a first-person shooting game with weapon simulation as the main gameplay, it can provide players with a realistic weapon operation experience. These include: real weapon operations, weapon operating logic and working methods, and realistic weapon firing performance. 2. Providing players with a different combat experience. For example, when reloading ammunition, the player is required to perform some operations (removing the old ammo clip, inserting a new ammo clip, resetting the gun, etc.) Instead of just pressing 'R' like in a traditional FPS game. These operations can better reflect the different performance of each weapon, and it is much more closer to the real gun battle experience. 3. This design of the game can better reflect the characteristics of different weapons. Just like every weapon in reality, these differences are not only reflected in the power, ballistics, and bomb amount, but also can make more different experiences. Such as weight, length, operational complexity, reliability and effective distance. 4. A rich tactical actions can be made in the game. In the game, tactical actions such as sliding tackle, tumbling, over obstacles, bunker shooting, sideways, stun gun shooting, left-hand gun shooting, one- handed two handed switching (pistol) can be made. The real weapon operation is combined with a variety of tactical actions, hoping to bring players a different combat experience. 5. Realistic weapon recoil system. Players need to have better control over the muzzle. As the game time and experience increase, players will achieve better and better shooting results. 6. Because there is a unique way to play, no other shooting game can experience the IPSC sport better than this game. The game provides a level closer to the real IPSC, making it easy for players to experience the practical shooting sport.",
