    "About the game": "Lithium City is a stylized isometric action game set in a neon-drenched world of electricity and violence. Take on the role of Tsunami , a lightning fast blue-haired girl as she fights her way through this dark and vibrant vision of the future. Intense Singleplayer Experience Fight, shoot, and dash your way through 6 chapters, each with a unique and compelling theme. Every room has been carefully crafted to provide an interesting challenge and to keep the momentum moving forward. No grinding or padding, just gameplay with a splash of environmental and non-verbal storytelling. Hard Hitting Combat Equip yourself with an assortment of modern, futuristic, and fantastical weapons. Take on armed guards, erratic thugs, mindless drones, and a host of other unsusual enemies. Plan your approach, or rely on quick reflexes to achieve victory. Original Soundtrack and Immersive soundscape Enjoy award winning audio and music (IGF China 2015 - Excellence in Audio) by composer John Camara (Solarmax 2) that combines elements of synthwave and orchestal music. Unique Visual Style The game uses a novel approach to animation that creates a smooth 3D effect from the game's 2D engine. UI is kept to a minimum to give the game a cinematic feel. How long can you keep running? Will we ever escape our own designs?",
