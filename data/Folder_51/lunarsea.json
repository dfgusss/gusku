    "About the game": "Cthulu is on the run after stealing the moon! Use the moon to influence the waves to avoid missiles and jagged rocks down below. Enjoy two different gameplay modes as you make your way through the increasingly challenging levels that test your abilities. The main campaign will follow the adventure of Cthulu who stole the moon due to his need for the power to control waves on his own planet in his own galaxy and finds himself on Earth while he attempts to escape from NASA and other enemies in his path. The endless runner mode will allow players to control Cthulu as they challenge personal records for distance for themselves and others playing the game and this also facilitates harvesting coins for upgrades for use in the game.",
