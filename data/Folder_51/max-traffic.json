    "About the game": "Max Traffic is a minimalistic traffic simulator where the player controls the flow of cars by managing the traffic lights. It is a mini casual game to relax to, but also excel at, by trying to achieve the highest score. Each level represents a flag, while the cars hold a minimalistic style. The sounds follow the same pattern by being abstract in their manner. Features: • Mechanics: As simple as possible, the players just have to press on the traffic lights to change from red to green and vice versa. • Relaxing: The game is as stressful as you want it to be, with the time also available on fast and slow. Fast however provides you with double score. • Competitive: For the hard working people out there, there is a scoring system for each level, at which everyone can excel at. • Interesting decisions: Every level provides a different traffic management, making the players adapt to every situation. • Abilites: Every in-game day the players get an ability to help with their progression. Hope you get as many cars as you can across traffic! See you on the leaderboard!",
