    "About the game": "Medusa was transformed into a gorgon for defiling Athena's temple while serving as a priestess there. Condemned to spend the rest of her life on a distant isle, she is determined to find a soulmate even though most of her visitors wish to chop off her head! Follow Medusa as she embarks on a journey to prove that even a gorgon can be loved. Play through a storyline that is both deep and lighthearted. Your actions will determine your fate. Defy mortals and the gods! Use your gorgon powers to turn things into stone. Go on quests. Meet the gods and other strange and interesting characters from greek mythology. Talk to your hair. NOTE: Originally, we planned to make this game three chapters long. Due to changing circumstances, we have decided to release the first chapter as a stand alone game. We hope you enjoy what we were able to finish.",
