    "About the game": "The reason we made Mirror Maker is to give the players the freedom to create. Make your own version of Mirror and share it with the world. After installing Mirror Maker, you can: 1. Re-create by your will on the basis of Mirror, and the original everything is at your disposal. 2. Download MODs that other gamers made. About Mirror Maker: In Mirror Maker, you can see clearly how the who game is structured, and you'll be able to edit scripts and CGs with ease. First download the script from the Workshop, and edit it as you want. Afte you finish making the MOD, you can upload it to Workshop directly from Mirror Maker. We now have unlocked the storyline part of the game for you to edit, and for sure, we'll definitely unlock more parts of the game later on.",
