    "About the game": "Mushroom: The Ruckus is a 2D top-down hack-n-slash type deal where you play as a mushroom with a vendetta against his kind. You are a social pariah, cast away from the 'cool' groups due to a series of non-descript events. You find affirmation in a mysterious floating eyeball who seems to enjoy watching you whack other mushrooms. That's where you come in- play through ten levels of hacking and another ten levels of slashing for a combined total of 20 levels of hack-n-slash combat against several different enemy types. ... Maybe once you've destroyed all these other mushrooms, you'll feel better? Good luck!",
