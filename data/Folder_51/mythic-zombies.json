That's Right, We will be supporting the game with free DLC, And we will never have any Microtransactions. But Why? As Gamers, We understand that paying for a game to then pay even more just to play any DLC is truly frustrating and can some times leave people behind and stop them from playing with there buddies, This is why We will support the game with Free Updates and DLC so we know you can play the way you want to. Every map that comes to Mythic zombies will be 100% Free, We will never charge for maps, We plan to have around 20 maps when the game comes out of early access. From Day one Mythic zombies will support Single-player, Lan And Online, So play with your mates, Sit back and relax with single-player, You don't even need to be connected online to play single-player so just like the old days, load up the game and start killing zombies. Within the first six months the game been out we plan to have all zombie and player characters changed as well as full mod support, XP system and guns added. We also plan to update a lot of our 3D models as well. With each update, we plan to add at least one map and gun.",
