    "About the game": "The four biggest nations of Planet Piston have done away with silly wars: they now send their steam-bot champions to compete in their favorite sport, Steam Arena! These compact, crazy contraptions are glass—cannon warriors, as destructive as they are fragile. Hitting hard, they explode each other into dozens of flying bits and shower the arena in a spectacle for all steam-kind to enjoy. It's an all-round nice day of child-friendly, ultra-violent family fun. Yay! Now it’s YOUR turn to let off some steam in Nation Breakers: Steam Arena- the 2D-action-steampunk-destructathon-platformer! Fight to the industrial beats of the music in incredibly fast, family-breaking, controller-flinging exciting matches! Pick your steam-bot. Destroy your enemies. Dismantle your friends. Delicately disassemble your loved ones (just joking, do not literally do this). Every projectile and death showers the arena with robotic debris, leaving an ever-growing bed of bits on the ground. The winning steam-bot takes home the trophy over the rabble in honor of their nation! PICK YOUR FAVORITE STEAM-BOT, PURE SKILL MAKES THE DIFFERENCE! The four great nations all supply their champion steam-bots to the arena for your choosing. SAWS , a shark-like, mean-tempered timber-mill bot from Bladia who fires sea mines and wields a vicious circular saw. DRAGO , a sacred dragon of Valvis with peppery breath and sharp fire-work shooting skills. ROOK , a militant guards-man from Gearland armed with a canon and a rapid-fire mace hammer and SLINKY , the agile engineer hailing from Chemelot, supercharged with a voltage attacks and flying tasers. And legend tells there are more secrets to be unlocked... 4 THEMES, EACH CONSISTING OF 12 LEVELS, UP TO A TOTAL OF 36 DYNAMIC FIGHTING ARENAS! Experience the home arenas of Valvis, Gearland, Chemelot and Bladia. Each expertly booby-trapped by expert steam-bot arena designers. Valvis : light festival lanterns that drop beneath your feet, explosive lanterns and confetti canons. Gearland : the industrial metal works factory with swinging smelter bowls, switching molten molds and dimming lights. Chemelot : the volatile and dangerous hazard, lab threatening, spitting acid vials, sticky sludge and slippery yet destructible glass chemical balls. And Bladia : a dangerous sawmill full of jump pads, flying wooden platforms and moving sawblades. Fittingly enough, its special weapon pick-up is a flying buzzsaw! RACE FOR PICKUPS! DYNAMITE, LASER, MISSILES, SHIELDS, AND MORE! Each theme offers a unique weapon as well as defensive pick-ups. The Dynamite is powerful and deals a wider area of damage than your base projectile, but be careful not to get yourself in the blast, use with care! The bouncing laser is excellent at reaching around corners, though their direction can be altered by a quick parry, make sure it's not being returned to the sender! The homing missile is always on the move for the closest victim and will keep hunting until it eventually falls to pieces. Defend yourself with hit taking shield or block the opponents range abilities with an Ammo-blocking pick-up. EVER-FLOWING ARENAS, BORDERED WITH PORTALS FOR YOU TO DART YOUR WAY TO SAFETY... OR TO FOOL YOUR OPPONENT! Left is right, right is left, up is down, down is up - you best be paying close attention to your foes. Remember, t he arena portals are not exclusive to players, but your flying shrapnel and projectiles will be making their way into unexpected corners too! TEST YOUR FRIENDSHIPS IN LOCAL COOP! On its Early Access release, Nation Breakers: Steam Arena will offer 3 game modes. Smash your friends in local co-op matches for 2-4 players ! Test your combat skills and reflexes in single-player mode Arena Run , a mad dash through the 12 levels of each theme, with each match throwing unique challenges at you, trying to get the highest score possible depending on your playstyle and difficulty -- and with a dynamic AI that adjusts its behavior based on your performance! Or hone your fighting ability in single-player practice quick battles against the AI.",
