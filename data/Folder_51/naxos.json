    "About the game": "Naxos is like all of my other games! I just feel like there arent many Auto Battle RPGS out there.... I really want to keep moving the genre forward! Okay why not try even more different formulas?? This time I decided to not use big menus ==( Many houses) I tried compacting everything in the game in 3 houses!
