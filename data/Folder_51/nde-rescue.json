Step right into the middle of a massive toxic gas leak that prompted the evacuation of a mysterious cryotech facility. Many employees are still stuck inside the premises; the toxic gas leaves only a few minutes to breathe before turning anyone into some sort of aggressive creature. UNCOVER DOZENS OF LEVELS FULL OF TRAPS Uncover dozens of hazardous technical sites in which you will have between 2 and 5 minutes to cap the gas leaks. In your exploration, you will need to save those who are already in a coma. They are having a Near Death Experience and you are here to bring them back to life!

Unlock the mysteries of the laboratory and incident: ­ - What happened? ­ - How did workers turn into zombies? ­ - How were people affected by the cryogenic deep freeze? ­What are the ectoplasmic entities, and where do they come from? ­ - Is there a world beyond!?
