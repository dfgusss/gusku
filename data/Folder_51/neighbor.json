    "About the game": "Sometimes, in life, there are places where the rules of reality just don't apply. Sometimes, it's the one place where you ought to feel safe. Like your house. Freelance designer Yuuki Kae has just moved into a new apartment. On her move-in day, she decides to introduce herself to her new next-door neighbor... but something isn't quite right. Static over the intercom... A violently rattling doorknob... And a ghostly pale hand reaching out through the crack in the door... They said the apartment next to hers wasn’t for rent. It was supposed to be empty. Through a series of strange events, Kae meets Hisamatsu Daigo, a fellow tenant who lives above her on the 3rd floor. Together, they must hunt for clues to solve the mystery… -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Neighbor is an updated remake of a classic Japanese horror visual novel, with all-new artwork and voice acting, as well as a brand new soundtrack by famed composer Ryu Takami. Players take the role of protagonist Yuuki Kae as she investigates the mysterious and terrifying events happening in her new apartment building. You'll experience the story through an immersive blending of text, visuals and audio, with a reserved presentation designed to lull the player into a false sense of security and amplify the chilling atmosphere. Neighbor is a kinetic novel with no player choices and a single ending, streamlining the story and enhancing player engagement. We hope you'll enjoy this spine-tingling adventure, fully voiced in Japanese and localized to English for the first time!",
