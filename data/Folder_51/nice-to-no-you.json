    "About the game": "Have you ever wanted to make choices that matter and you like cyberpunk? Congratulations!!! The glorious Quality-Network has just accepted your application for becoming the next quality-A.I. First, we will have to test your decision-making skills to make sure that you don`t fuck this up. Hence you will have 12 days to prove yourself in the least important sector of our Quality-Network : The mental health of our humans. In the MindReset program, you will decide which humans get to keep their memories and which will lose them. If you fail to improve our society, I will be forced to delete you. Now go out there and make the Quality-Network productive again! Sincerely, M.A.I. Gameplay Perfection lies in selection: Every day you will choose 3 out of 5 unique characters to interview for that day. Characters rejected at that stage might come back later. Get to know them: You have 3 questions to dive deep into the characters' personalities (or just make jokes). We know you hate if every question gets the same answer. Therefore you will have more than 420+ unique dialog options with unique answers to choose from. Get to NO them: After you got to know the characters on a personal level you now have to decide who will hear a no and whose memory you will delete. Of course, you can also decide to fulfill no one's wish. It was nice to know you: Say goodbye to the lucky human. What have you done?! Access the database to find out what impact your decision had on the individual and society.",
