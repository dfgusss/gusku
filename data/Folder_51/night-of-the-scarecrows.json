    "Release date": "Mar 29, 2020",
    "About the game": "Hardcore old-school first person arena shooter, created by single person. Welcome back to 1999: no regenerating health, no screen hints, no radars, no assisted navigation. All you need is to escape the scarecrows, shoot them and avoid the impact of your own rockets. Features: 'Quick Death' game mode: first person shooter chess. Ammo is limited, so you have to avoid enemies, waiting for a chance to blast at least two of them with single shot. 'Barn Massacre' game mode: you are locked in a small barn with hundreds of nasty faceless scarecrows. Enjoy the music of falling enemies and the rain of their guts. 'Gas Tower Defence' game mode: protect your sniping spot. With rifles. Given to you by Mother Mary. After your diligent prayers. Hardcore gameplay. Hardcore mean really hardcore, like console games back in 90s. Atmospheric retro setting of desolated East-European countryside. Hordes of enemies: deadly ones, ugly ones, and almost invincible ones. Scarecrow decomposition system. Global leader tables. Heavily optimised executable. The only game where you can bless yourself with the sign of the cross.",
