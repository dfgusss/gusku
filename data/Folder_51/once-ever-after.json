    "About the game": "Everyone knows how the story goes: innocent, 18-year-old Red Riding Hood goes into the woods and is corrupted by the naughty, naughty Big Bad Wolf. Ingrid is the newest Little Red Riding Hood: she doesn't know what awaits her in the dark woods, but she knows that it seems exciting. But Ingrid's world is only one of an infinite number of Tales, and those stories are starting to bleed over into one another. War is coming, and Ingrid doesn't even know what war is. Nothing will ever be the same, and the only weapon Ingrid has to face the changes is sexy fun. Features A 20-30 hour RPG across multiple alternate fairy tales. 25+ base scenes with 200+ images total. 30+ chibi images illustrating cute plot moments. Two difficulty modes: you can play a challenge where strategy is more important than grinding, or a more relaxed mode where you can enjoy the story. All characters have access to multiple classes and skill trees that can be mixed and matched. Visible enemies instead of random encounters. Modern quality of life features like autosave slots. Quest log to organize required and optional content. Optional post-game challenges leading to second ending.",
