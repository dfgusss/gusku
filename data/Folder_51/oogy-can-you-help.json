    "About the game": "You fall through the snow, and become… a deckbuilding sheep!? Collect new mechanics. Uncover dark mysteries. Make new friends in this musical indie adventure. Will Oogy survive the haunted rooms of the sprawling wintery house? It's up to you to decide, while uncovering the backstory behind each of the strange and powerful things inside. Expect plenty of witty characters, 40+ original music tracks, 15+ hand-crafted rooms, 5+ hours of creative roguelite card mechanics—plus, free seasonal updates! Oogy: Can You Help is the passion project of a single developer, built from the ground-up in a custom video game engine to provide a uniquely vibrant and surprisingly detailed experience. Welcome to the Front Yard In Oogy: Can You Help , the goal is to collect as many unique moves as possible by exploring the map. Enter the wintry house after winning over the front door, Phil . Every new encounter forces you to choose: do you save your opponent by 'cleaning' them, or do you kill them, leaving some of their best moves unreachable? Story Oogy: Can You Help is driven by the dark story that keeps seeping into every room of the arts-and-craft styled map. The characters and cinematics are designed to pull in narrative-loving players, while still being completely optional for action-lovers. Fight on and find out how to tie up the loose ends of Wally , Smarty , Guy #1 and Guy #2 , Cap , and the Girl . Cards - Collect as many cards as you can as Oogy , the sheep who answers the call for help - Jump right into gameplay with easy to understand controls and a minimal combat system (start with a 4 card hand, and a deck that is never shuffled) - Combo out with unique decks that are only possible based on where you go and who you save - Overpower your foes with both familiar mechanics (such as Attack, Defend, Heal) and surprisingly quirky mechanics (Remix, Eat, Nightmare) Encounters - Randomized decks for each opponent (after the Mud Room), with autosaving after every battle - Encounters scale with your level, allowing you to explore and rematch in any order - Saving (cleaning) your opponent normally unlocks a permanent card, while killing unlocks a choice of a temporary card - Each boss unlocks the Memory Card, allowing you to play more cards on your turn (finally!) Design - Original music for each room and major encounter in the game - Fully supports PC and Mac, as well as Keyboard, Mouse, and Controller - Hand-drawn character aesthetic and arts-and-crafts map style - Hidden passageways and optional cutscenes that rewards playing like a completionist Extras - Endgame that encourages multiple playthroughs - Extra rooms that have compelling gameplay switchups - Infinitely long ‘The Attic Observatory’ - Rhythm map ‘The Music Room’ Wait… you're still here? So… what are you waiting for? You need to pick up the call for help, Oogy-oog!",
