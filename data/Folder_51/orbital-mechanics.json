    "About the game": "In Orbital Mechanics you take the role of a small mining robot, tasked with mining the energy rich power-crystals found on nearby asteroids. However, you are set upon by crystal pirates with their sole goal of stealing the crystals. Use your weapons to combat the pirates! The left mouse button operates your main weapon. A fast, low-power weapon which can be used to break crystals. The right mouse button utilises the EMP weapon. This is a much stronger, slower weapon which runs on the energy of blue power-crystals. Additionally, it has the ability to weaken the crystal pirates shield. You can also tether yourself to other nearby asteroids by looking at one and holding 'Tab' while floating in space.",
