    "About the game": "Visualize music with projectM! Experience psychedelic and mesmerizing visuals by transforming music into equations that render into a limitless array of user-contributed visualizations. projectM can detect audio input from any application (like Spotify or Apple Music) or you can use input from a microphone. Get Started projectM works out of the box. To get started play music from any source, launch projectM, then press F1 to see the available help options. Note: Mac and Linux will take a bit more work to get audio from any application, so check the discussion forum for tips. Features A visual masterpiece Unlock the potential of your computer: projectM is lightweight and ready to push the limits of your setup: get ready for 4k at 144fps. Limitless Potential with Presets projectM is a framework for producing visualizations of audio, but the art comes from user-contributed presets. You can create your own presets using any text editor and your imagination or you can find nearly two decades worth of presets online. We are distributing over 1,000 working presets but you can find packages of more than 40,000 online. Play Along You can interact with visualizations with your mouse by dropping and dragging waveforms on the screen and watching them come alive. Full Screen and Multi-Monitor Unlike other visualization tools, projectM can stretch across as many monitors as you provide it. Free Software projectM is free software with an active open-source development community behind it. Do you want to join in the fun?
