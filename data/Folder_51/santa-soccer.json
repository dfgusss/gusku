    "About the game": "Christmas season is over and soccer season has begun. Sometimes Santa likes to take a relaxing trip down to the soccer field and score a few goals. However this is not your average soccer field. This one is filled with Christmas magic causing targets to add, and take away, points. Which you need 50 to win. Santa also has a robust athletic ability to play golf which you can see for yourself in the golf mode. You better look out, you better not cry, because Santa is kicking a soccer ball in the sky!",
