    "About the game": "Shrines Of Sacred Essenсe - is a tactical card game , that based on rules of moba genre . Your main goal in the game is destroy opponent's shrine using mythical creatures of the magical forest. Pick ones that you need and try to block cards that your opponent wants. Use their spells and attacks to win the battle! If you ever played Dota or Lol it's gonna be easier for you to learn how to play, because it's got same stuns , silences and more mecanics you know. Otherwise, game have in-game wiki that include every pice of information you need. It is not a AAA shooter with battle-royale, so there are no proper match macking . Anyways , It's way much fun to play with your friend . Cause what's can be better than try to mess up each others plans. You can use demo-version to connect to game, if game hosted with full version. Key Features: Unique game gameplay. A lot of cards in dark fantasy style. Game deep enough to make you able to create your strategy. Game is complex, so there are a lot of things you need to know to be good at the game. P.S. from dev: I were making this game alone like 400 hours or more, and it's still fun for me and my friends to play it from time to time, even though we have other games which are better.",
