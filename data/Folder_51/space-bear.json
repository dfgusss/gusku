    "About the game": "A “TYPING” “ADVENTURE” “GAME” WHAT IS SPACE BEAR? It is exactly what it sounds like NO SERIOUSLY TELL ME ABOUT THE GAME ALREADY It's a multi-choice text adventure typing game! Sort of. With some crappy graphics. ANY UNIQUE MECHANICS? Since you are play an impatient bear, instead of typing out the full sentence like OTHER typing games, you can just mash your paws on the keyboard to finish a sentence. WHAT ABOUT THE STORY? It's that tired old formula of a bear wearing a talking Spacesuit that has to save his planet from destruction. Look just play it and stop bothering me. It's only about 30 minutes long. GIVE ME ONE REASON WHY I SHOULD PLAY IT Well it's called Space Bear for one. Oh all right. There's a dance battle in it. COOL IT SOUNDS REALLY GOOD! It's not. HOW MUCH WOULD YOU EXPECT TO PAY FOR SUCH QUALITY? Nothing. THEN YOU WILL BE PLEASANTLY UNSURPRISED TO LEARN THAT SPACE BEAR IS COMPLETELY FREE! But I like advertisements, in-game purchases, freemium titles, in-game timers... WELL...UHHH...WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL MAYBE? What's the sequel about? PROBABLY UNDERWATER BEAR Any cool new sidekicks? MAYBE A KLEPTOMANIAC DIVING SUIT WITH A FOUL TEMPER? Wait, how did I become the one asking the questions? UH...UM...TUNE IN NEXT TIME FOLKS! GAME FEATURES: Learn mad typing skills...bear style! You can totally play this game by mashing your paws on the keys! Some* art! (*YMMV) Multiple choice* branching story! (*It's pretty linear...) An epic aforementioned story of bravery, courage, daring, determination, fear-overcomingness, fortitude, tenacity and other words! Fight the evil Void Moles and save the Bear planet from destruction?! TESTIMONIALS: 'Makes typing fun again!' - Damon Smith (author of Space Bear) 'It's a bit shit.' - Jordan Ewen (Friend of Damon Smith (author of Space Bear)) 'I don't understand. What is Steam?' - Ann Smith (Mother of Damon Smith (author of Space Bear)) 'The art looks like it was done by a talented 4 year old.' - (Sister of Damon Smith (author of Space Bear))",
