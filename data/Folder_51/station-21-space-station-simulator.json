    "About the game": "Station 21 is a space builder, survival game where you start with the bare bones of a space station and work your way up to making a station of immense proportion. You start with a four way core module from which you can expand by taking on missions to get your station up and running and earning your company money to expand further. In Station 21 you earn money buy investing in laboratory modules where you can choose which experiments you would like to run and training your crew in order to keep them progressing. The more advanced the experiment becomes the more money you will earn. But there is a catch, you only get paid once the information has been transmitted from a relay module. Once you start earning money, you can start building and resupplying your hard working crew with leisure modules, food, drinks and of course new tech to play with. The building in Station 21 is amazing in scale, you can build your station to have well over 1,000 modules and keep going, the possibilities are endless. The main mechanics featured within Station 21 are as follows: Huge building area Over 20 different modules (plus later updates) Natural disasters (small objects collisions, fires etc.) Life support management Food management Research Tree Missions Loans Power management Events Crew management Re-supply missions Upgrade Modules Space Flight Mining Asteroids and more as development progresses. This game will be a continuous development, we have a lot of features still planned and we would like to keep updating even when it gets to a full feature point. Thank you all for your support in the development.",
