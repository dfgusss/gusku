    "About the game": "This is my first published game, made using Unity and Playmaker. Super cube smash is a rhythmic action game that generates music as you play. It is set on the mysterious ancient spaceship 'The Dwarfstone' where the most peculiar and unfortunate of events have occurred. Your mission is to find the core of the ship and destroy the source of the acidic alien cube swarm, before it grows to a concentration beyond your control. Super Cube Smash is a very difficult single player challenge, with an official steam leader board. Features... -Rhythmic step-sequencer; putting everything in time to the rhythm, even your gun shots. -Dark, moody and colourful aesthetic. -Responsive, familiar controls (wasd and mouse or Xbox pad). -17 tough hand crafted levels. -Non-linear completion. -Adaptive difficulty. The more you complete and level up, the harder it gets. -A shooting game without gore (child friendly). -Hardcore mode (because the game isn't hard enough already). Granting the opportunity for higher scores. Super cube smash was created solely by Lewis Fitzjohn over the course of 2014 - 2015. Steam online leader-board functionality implemented by David Jordan.",
