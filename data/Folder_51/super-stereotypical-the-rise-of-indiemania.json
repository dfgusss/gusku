    "About the game": "In stereotypical fashion, Super Stereotypical: The Rise of Indiemania is a game inspired by the 16-bit era of gaming (it's possible ...that this has already been done before...) It is a 2D action side-scroller and mainly a linear experience. Keep moving forward to each new stage while fighting supernatural enemies/bosses, avoiding hazards, discovering items, and utilizing vehicles! The goal of the game is to progress to the last stage and defeat the final boss. Early Access Features: Currently 5 playable stages, for a combined total of 28 areas of varying size Example areas: a barren wasteland, mushroom jungle ruins, an underwater palace, evil forests, a castle...and more of course! Your main weapon is a whip with a multi-directional ability: attack horizontally, vertically and diagonally Discover a new sub weapon on each stage: Crystal Crosses, Mushroom Bombs, Throwing Leaves, etcetera Most sub weapon have a secondary use, e.g. the Crystal Cross can turn into a shield to repel enemies, the Throwing Leaf can be thrown at multiple angles Find hidden items, such as health, score, projectile ammunition and extra lives pickups in each area 39 different enemies and 5 bosses to battle In certain areas, utilize vehicles such as minecarts, a mushroom-ship with a laser cannon, a super strong penguin and others Completely original artwork and music Developed by one guy! Story: An Evil Nerd has created yet another 2D game...how surprising! To create his new world the Evil Nerd has stolen and corrupted the souls of many Indie Developers! Our hero is forced to play the game over and over until he is able to free the Indie Souls and defeat the Evil Nerd and his minions! Do you have what it takes to put an end to the Evil Nerd ( and his unoriginal ideas ) and destroy Castle Indiemania once and for all ( or maybe not... )?",
