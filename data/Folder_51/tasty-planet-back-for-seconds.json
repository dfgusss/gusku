    "About the game": "Control a tiny ball of grey goo with the ability to eat anything smaller than itself. The more it eats, the bigger it gets! Soon you'll be able to eat the entire planet! The story begins with the goo eating a time machine, causing him to be sent back in time. Playing as the goo, you'll eat your way through six different time periods: modern, Late Cretaceous (i.e. dinosaurs), Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, Feudal Japan, and the distant future. Each time period features a unique set of objects for you to eat. Mice, cats, Tyrannosaurus Rex, mummies, gladiators, and flying saucers are just a few of the hundreds of objects available for consumption. Levels can span vastly different object sizes; in one level you'll grow all the way from the size of an amoeba to the size of a galaxy. A complete 2-player cooperative game is also included so you'll be able to play the entire game with a friend. After completing the main game you'll unlock a ton of bonus levels that provide additional challenge. Levels There are almost 50 levels in the main story mode of the game. There are also nearly 50 bonus levels - these include completely new levels and challenging versions of previous levels. Controller Support Keyboard and mouse controls are supported in all modes. On Windows, most controllers will work for the single player game. To use controllers in 2-player coop mode, both controllers need to be Xbox 360 or Xbox One controllers. On Mac, PS3 and PS4 controllers are supported.
