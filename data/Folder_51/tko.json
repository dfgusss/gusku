    "About the game": "Come face-to-face with a heavyweight champ! Too many boxing games place the player outside the ring looking in. How can you experience the adrenaline jolt of landing a crisp uppercut from the cheap seats? Now you can literally “enter the ring” in the classic first-person boxing game TKO from Accolade™ – the boxing game that sticks you right on the canvas, staring straight into the eyes of a prize fighter bent on rearranging your face. TKO ’s features make it a unanimous decision: Split-screen, arcade-style boxing action gives you a dual, first-person perspective. Watch yourself hit and get hit. Witness the punishment of the punches on each fighter’s face. They swell. They bruise. They turn black and blue. Calibrate each boxer’s strengths. Is his left better than his right? Is he cat-like or a clubber? Does he run out of band-aids or run out of gas? Fight a stable of hungry contenders, each with his own ringside manner. Slug it out with large, animated fighters. Pick on somebody your own size. One or two player capability: pummel friends or clobber the computer. Aerial-cam shows your position in the ring.",
