Trash the bedroom, mess up the bathroom, then discover what lays beyond the front door as you roam freely in a vast world. Leave an extensive trail of destruction in your wake. The huge world that awaits you is filled with dozens of enterable houses and buildings, driveable cars, various missions, heaps of collectables, hidden areas, and more. In many cases it's important to get yourself into a silly mood (maybe get drunk first) to fully enjoy and appreciate this game. Yes really. It's fun to customize your character - press [H] any time in game. Don't forget the accessories! Make sure you EXPLORE! Cars are a great way to get around quickly. There are lots of areas to go to and many things to do - look out for the industrial area, the ghetto, the fire station, the park, the farm, the caravan park, and more!
