    "About the game": "ULTIRE: Balls Out is an action-packed game that is easy to pick up, but requires great precision and decision-making skills to master. Control your ball, collect pickups and avoid obstacles as you compete in different game modes: Elimination Arena A multiplayer game mode that has up to 8 players packed into the same arena. Avoid being thrown off platforms by all costs — last ball 'alive' wins. Stay active! Different pickups will spawn during the round — camping only hurts your chances to win. Singleplayer Race A singleplayer mode where you need to collect all checkpoints to beat the map in the lowest time possible. Fight to shave milliseconds off your time by avoiding tiny mistakes — they matter a whole lot! See where you rank amongst your friends and players from all over the world on the Leaderboards. You can also customize your ball by using BallCoins that you earn just by playing the game!",
