Find hidden interactions as you destroy cars, lamps and dumpsters. Collect the highest score possible as the precious timer ticks away! Each play only gives you a limited amount of time to explore and reach as high of a score as you can. You won't do well on your first attempt. After playing the level a few times you'll start to develop a strategy for reaching the highest score possible. Don't forget to also keep the combo! Challenge Mode - Timed challenge with fixed interactions which you can learn Random Mode - Timed challenge with randomized interactions which are never the same Exploration Mode - Play with no pressure and explore at your own pace Steam Leaderboards integration - compete against your friends Satisfying killing with just 1 click People who live their lives, policemen who patrol the city - all reacting to your actions as they crumble from fear or are trying to run away from your rage Many hidden secrets and ways to achieve a high score Combo feature - keep clicking successfully and get extra points There are many secrets to uncover and many surprising interactions yielding higher than usual rewards, so be sure to leave no stone unturned. When you are satisfied with your score, you can switch it up and try the random mode where you never know what awaits you, or you can always just chill and learn in the no-pressure exploration mode!",
