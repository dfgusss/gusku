    "About the game": "Play the melody by punching the lyrics and stars flying at you to the beat of the music! *The lyrics and songs are all in Japanese. About the Game VR RHYTHM ACTION SEIYA is not your average rhythm game where you just keep beat with the song -- it's a virtual reality music game where you can actually play the melody. Punching the flying stars coming out of the screen will play a note from an instrument, and lyric stars will sing the words. The game can even help you exercise since your score is based on how hard you punch. Features - No confusing or complex controls like all the buttons on the Oculus Touch or Vive controllers, just punch and play. - 25 songs to play in total -- from EDM to pop rock.We plan to add songs in as time goes on with free updates! - Play on a stage just like an actual venue with wonderful light shows to make you feel like you’re really there! - A music game where you play the melody with your own two hands, rather than just keep the beat to the music.",
