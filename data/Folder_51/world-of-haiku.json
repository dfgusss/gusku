    "About the game": "The World of Haiku takes you through an amazing cyberpunk RPG adventure in a world where the only way you will survive is to constantly learn new hacking skills. Set in a highly digitized society where giant megacorporations and covert government agencies fight for control, play the part of freelance hacker team operatives that work in the shadows of the Grid. With each mission, you will gain a core understanding of how the real Linux operating system works and how to control true-to-life cyber tools like JohnTheRipper, Hydra, Nmap, Ping, SSH, and many more. Everything you learn in the game powers you up even more in real life. Surf the Grid, hack into Megacorps and decide your path in the game and in the real world.",
