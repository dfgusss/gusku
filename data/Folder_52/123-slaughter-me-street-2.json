    "About the game": "Welcome Everyone to Slaughter Me Street 2 In this exciting prequel to the hit game '123 Slaughter Me Street', we find out the deep dark secrets that lead up to the madness of this series. You find yourself confused with blood on your hands in a dark house with only a flashlight to guide you. As clarity and cognizance begins to set in, the confusing haze you were feeling was almost a comfort compared to the harsh reality, that you... are not alone. The air is putrid, and all you can feel are the eyes of the dead upon you. When there is nowhere to run, all you can do is hide. But what is safe? When your inspiration comes from the other side, eventually you have to pay the piper. In this deadly game of 'Hide and Seek' you must stealthily fill your 'Hide Meter' while evading your nemesis, and using your light for finding areas of refuge. Can you survive these 10 Deadly Levels of pure adrenaline rushing terror? The large blue creature is the Seeker. He does just this, he will seek you out! His primary objective is to cover as much ground as possible and he loves to get in your face! The tall skinny pink creature is the Greeter (Revenge) - much like her cousin, from SMS1, she enjoys taking her time and hanging around dimly lit areas. She just wants to say hello. The brown short creature is the Screamer. He is quite passive and will not go out of his way to harm you. He will however stop what he is doing to scream at you, alerting either the Seeker or Greeter to your whereabouts. He also can be stopped with perfect timing and a light in his face - which will cause him to panic and leave.",
