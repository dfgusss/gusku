    "About the game": "Big classic platformer with tons of power-ups and 12+ hours of main story &amp; 300+ hidden locations just begging for exploration. 8BitBoy is a tribute to all the greatest platformers of the 80s and 90s and a symbol of my endless love and passion for gaming. · 8-12 hours main story! · 56 Levels + huge 5 Worlds · 300+ Hidden Locations! · Hidden Warp zones! · Coin collecting game + tons of Power-Ups · Boss-battles · 60 fps frame rate (GPU dependent) Appropriate for all ages * Full Xbox 360 Controller Support (Auto switch - push button A to enable) Who's 8BitBoy? 8BitBoy is out of a job, and quite frankly he's depressed about it. Then he suddenly remembers all the good times he had as a kid, playing his trusted 8-bit console. Deep down in the far and darkest corner of the basement he finds it along with a strange looking cartridge. He plugs in the cartridge right away, and get sucked into a vivid, but decaying world of platforming. And this is where your adventure takes off. 8BitBoy is the platformer I always dreamt about playing as a kid. It's a fantastic mash-up of the greatest of the late 80's and 90's and a complete game on it's own terms. This is a true tribute to old school gaming and by no means a walk in the park, but it's also never unfair. With big challenges, the sense of accomplishment is always bigger and better. To me, 8BitBoy is the ultimate classic platformer on PC and Mac. and a symbol of my love and passion for gaming. Yours Sincerely, Rasmus Kønig Sørensen Indie developer and sole creator of 8BitBoy",
