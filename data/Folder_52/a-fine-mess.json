    "About the game": "You find yourself on a strange island where the civilization has ended. Up on the sky you see the moon shattered, distant cities destroyed and a mysterious woman in an age-old outfit, biding her time on the beach as if none of it happened. As you traverse this uncanny surrounding, you start to unravel its mysteries. This is an impressionist art-game about love and loss, a tribute to our dear friend Deger Deniz . In order to piece all the puzzles, you might need to search beyond the game itself. The game lasts about 30 to 60 mins, depending on how keen you are to find all the secrets and unlock all the achievements. Music by Cava Grande. Follow Santima Games Facebook Page: /",
