It features a collection of puzzles built around this, which reward you with pearls should you complete them under the specified number of moves. Partner up with a friend to solve the co-op exclusive puzzles, where both players' moves count towards the pearl counter, or play solo and experience the dialogue between two omnipresent entities who are watching you. The game can be controlled completely with two buttons, including menu navigation, but other keys and controller support are also available for ease.",
