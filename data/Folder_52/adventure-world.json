    "About the game": "*Story The northeast of the kingdom is known as the Adventure World. People build towns near dungeons which attract a bunch of adventurers to come here. With dreams, our heroine Alisa became one of these adventurers. She will write her own story with her sword. *Content The main story would be a guide for your adventure. You could also ignore it and do what you like. Pick up a random NPC on the street to be your partner or kidnap him/her for money. Most monsters don't make you game over but morality does. If you keep doing bad things, your morality goes down and your career would come to an end soon. *Battle Adventure World has a simple but various battle system. You have 3 battle styles . Different partners support you in different ways. There's no particular solution about how to clear a dungeon. And there isn't much penalty when you lose. You could keep trying tactics until you find a suitable one.",
