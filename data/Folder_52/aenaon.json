    "About the game": "Aenaon-To Ancient Greece and Back Remember when you wished for a journey to the times of Zeus and Athena? When you dreamt about your winning entrance to the stadium of Olympia, as the winner of the everlasting Olympic Games- everybody cheers for you and you only! Well, the time is now; and forever. Aenaon-To Ancient Greece and Back takes you to an exciting journey to Ancient Greece. As the main character, determined to explore yourself and your capabilities, you will set on an adventure from the colonies in Massalia (France), to Poseidonia in South Italy. Before you dock to Greece and head towards Olympia, you will share your days with Socrates, Pythagoras, the Olympian Gods: this is not a journey as usual. It is the path to knowledge and strength, to sports and friendship. A course that lasts forever- this is exactly what Aenaon means. Aenaon-To Ancient Greece and Back is adventurous and educational a game that makes the most of the virtual reality features to recreate the experience of those times- in terms of action and thinking. The morals of Greek Philosophers inspire dilemmas that will lead to the essence of the Olympic Games: it is the joy of participation and the posthumous fame that really matters. Through the routes of Mythology and History, we bring back to life an era that founded western civilization- and now, you can be a part of it. Are you ready for eternal glory? Inside: • Travel through the ancient world in the time of ancient Greece to retrieve parts of Kotinos (wreath of a wild olive branch with which they crowned the winner in the Olympic Games) • Take part in an adventure with the guidance of ancient Greek to reach the city of Olympia • You can see Pythagoras, Socrates, and others but there are Hera, Athena, Hephaestus, and lot more 'ancient celebrities' soon! • Play games like puzzles, memory traps and find things • All the ancient Olympic sports (javelin and running pre-leased version) The pre-leased version is until Poseidonia. Help us to reach Olympia sooner!",
