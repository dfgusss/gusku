    "About the game": "Blind is a narrative-driven psychological thriller for virtual reality where the player is blind and must explore their surroundings using echolocation. Waking up in a strange room with little memory of how she came to be there, a young woman makes the shocking discovery she has lost her sense of sight. Goaded by the sinister and twisted Warden, she must explore a perverse and frightening mansion using sound alone. By sending out soundwaves with a cane, the outlines of objects are briefly revealed, enabling the player to navigate the mansion, solve puzzles and uncover the mystery of what is happening to her. As she gets closer and closer to the truth, however, she will be forced to confront her worst enemy--that which she does not, or will not see. Born out of the Global Game Jam in 2014, which had the theme of “We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are”, the Blind team won the Best Game award at the Turin (Italy) jam site with their entry Come to See My House. The team then began work on a full game based on this initial concept. Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Blind will be launching September 18, 2018. Learn to navigate carefully and cautiously using your cane. Send out soundwaves to reveal your surroundings briefly before they fade into darkness. Gramophones and other objects that make sound become lighthouses in the all-encompassing blackness. Built from the ground up for virtual reality and supporting binaural audio and motion control, Blind is a fully immersive and unique experience that removes you from the world you are used to, and asks you to see things differently. Where are you? Who is the Warden? Why has he kidnapped you and why does he want you to solve the puzzles in this strange and yet somehow eerily familiar place? Experience a constant sense of foreboding and emotional tension as you travel deeper into a mansion riddled with puzzles and dangers. As you search for answers, will you find things you’d rather not see?",
