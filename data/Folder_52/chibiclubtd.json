You and your 5 friends/Towers must stop incoming waves from entering the S54 a very trendy nightclub', For reasons! ' Mal the bouncer will ID check them but you need strategic Tower Placement. The Game uses a 5way scissor paper rock system commonly referred to as Scissor Paper Rock Lizard Spock. A good mixture of Towers is essential to endgame Waves. The Perk system is very unforgiving. Acquiring Perks is difficult so spend wisely. The Creep are some of the coolest looking Chibi Characters you've seen. Watching them come to life blew me away we have a great beginner Artist. The Entire game was made on a very tight budget and the producer is not a fan of in game transactions or advertisements you wont find them in any game made by MHC.
