And The Sun Went Out is one of the most complex interactive adventure stories ever written! No one player can discover the entire story in a single play through. Each time you conclude one of the fifteen story arcs, see how many other players ended the story in the same spot as you. You may have visited different countries and locations, developed close relationships with different characters, and ultimately reached an ending where your fate and the fate of your AI companion, Moti, is very, very different. Synopsis: What if the sun inexplicably vanished only to return hours later? Investigate with your AI companion, Moti. Uncover conspiracies. Discover ancient religions. Travel the globe. Find out who is murdering scientists and what this has to do with the random disappearances of the sun. This is your journey, and only your choices can expose the truth .",
