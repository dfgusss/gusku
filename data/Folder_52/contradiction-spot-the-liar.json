    "Release date": "Jul 10, 2015",
    "About the game": "Contradiction is a unique adventure / murder mystery game that uses live-action video for the entirety of the game play. All you have to do is interview characters, spot their lies and catch them out! Contradiction is a brand new take on the concept of an interactive movie and brings the genre to a whole new level of playability. It plays as smoothly as a 3D graphic game. You can wander freely around the game environment, collecting evidence and witnessing constantly changing events. But the game is all about interviewing the characters you meet, questioning them about all the evidence you’ve collected and things you’ve seen, then spotting contradictions in their answers. Pair two contradictions together and watch them try to worm out of it! Works best plugged into a TV preferably with a bunch of people to help spot the lies - but can be played alone on your laptop or PC just fine! As of March 2021 the Windows game has been updated - if you have a previous game you want to return to you can download the 'legacy' version instead from one of the Beta branches (instructions pinned on the discussions forum). The legacy version of the game with French subtitles by Pierre-Laurent Batut is also available for download on a Beta branch, again instructions are pinned to the top of the discussions forum. Why not try our horror game At Dead Of Night: /",
