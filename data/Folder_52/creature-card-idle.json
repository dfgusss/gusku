    "About the game": "Idler meets TCG! The hit web game finally comes to Steam, complete with achievements &amp; cloud saves. Now with NO ads and NO microtransactions!! Buy once and play all content forever, including the base game and its three expansions. Named one of the best games in the genre by gaming site PCGamesN, and one of the winners of Kongregate's November 2019 game competition , this is a incremental game where you place cards strategically on a grid to generate resources, and you spend those resources to purchase booster packs containing new cards. Once you have enough resources, unlock the next expansion. Each expansion is its own little idle game that adds new mechanics and new cards to the mix, ensuring the game never gets stale. Later expansions change the formula even more, featuring RPG-like battle mechanics. New expansions are added regularly for free. Features deep mechanics with various card synergies and many deck possibilities (join our Discord for hundreds of deck possibilities if you need help strategizing!). The game is 100% strategic idler and 0% clicker, so you won't break your mouse playing. If you enjoyed this game, come check out my next game Eternal Exodus is a story-driven monstertaming RPG where you can fuse demons together, craft items and equipment for them, and explore a massive world full of sidequests. Coming to PC and consoles. Please consider wishlisting it below. :)",
