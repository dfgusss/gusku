    "About the game": "Story: The story is about a girl called Naokee. She's forced to become an assassin after being taken from her place of origin. As time goes on, she encounters people who are willing to help her break free and learn the truth, as the technologically advancing city is slowly thrown into chaos. You're trying to take her towards the end result you see fit, as you can influence aspects of her personality so she prioritizes certain things over others. There is no good or bad ending, there's only action and consequence. The connection to her can only be severed by death. Gameplay: The game is a sci-fi, fast paced, turn-based RPG where split-second decisions can decide a fight.
