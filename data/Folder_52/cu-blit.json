Follow the journey of a small worker robot using the last of its battery to restore the robot civilization back to normal. In Cu-Blit, you play as a small worker robot running on the last of its battery, giving you limited amounts of movement per level. Control multiple robots, recharge, build pathways, and teleport your way through the run down city in hopes to reboot the system and bring back the power to the robotic civilization. Cu-Blit has 40+ levels of varying difficulty.",
