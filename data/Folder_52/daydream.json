    "About the game": "Imagine you're a kid back in the 90s. You woke up early because you're excited you're going to play your favorite JRPG. You grab a bowl of cereal and power up your Nintendo console. Daydream is all you would expect from the JRPGs of yore, plus voice acting and original music to give life to the story and characters. When their captain goes missing, our young heroes decide to embark on a journey that will lead them to discover the chilling truth about themselves, their unresolved past and uncertain future. I've been working on this game for more than 10 years now. I'm proud to finally release it into the world, so you can get to know the characters that have been with me for such a long time. -NOT yet another RPGMaker game -8-10 hours of gameplay with no unnecessary grinding -Full voice acting during cutscenes -Amazing original music! -Fight in turn-based combat and trigger quick time events from your characters' abilities -Summon powerful creatures by playing a rhythm minigame -Customize your weapons with magic stones to give your characters buffs and abilities -Find legendary weapons by completing side-quests -Play with your XBox or Playstation controller (note: wireless adapter not supported for the Playstation controller) -No DLC, no IAP, no NFT, no BS, the whole game is yours for you to play *Come chat with us on Discord!
