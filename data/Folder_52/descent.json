    "About the game": "Prepare To Start Your Descent. Sensory overload in 360° 3-D. Welcome to Descent™ - 27 levels of the most mind-bending, stomach-churning action game ever. Featuring true 3-Dimensional worlds with light source shading, texture mapping, 3-D morphing, directional sound effects and sizzling music, this is technology taken to the limit. Something has happened at Lunar Base I. The Post-Terran Mining Company has lost contact with the miners and none of the mining robots are responding. The PTMC has brought in you the Material Defender to deal with the situation. Your mission is to find any survivors and find the source of threat. You will start a journey that takes you from the Moon to Pluto. Best of luck Material Defender. Lunge straight down mine shafts, twist around never-ending tunnels and fight your way past robotic menaces in an environment that's truly 6 degrees of freedom... move up, move down, shoot everything everywhere. Hang onto your senses (and your lunch) as you drop straight down mine shafts on a ride that'll leave you spinning. And what's the good of losing your mind if you can't share the experience with your friends? Descent invites you and your buddies to dive into the action together with head-to-head combat and cooperative two-player modem and eight-player network support. Get ready for Descent...",
