    "About the game": "'The reverse dating simulator, where you're the waifu!' 'Will you escape?! Or will the protagonist get to you first?!' As you and your weeaboo friends are having a great time hanging out at the anime club suddenly, everything changes for the worst. While preparing to play a parody visual novel game your friend recommended, appearing onscreen you all spot a mysterious link. What the barnacle is this?! Let's see what it says... Waifu simulator, download now. Suddenly, your friend Akira reaches over and hits download. 'No! Stop!' you scream, but it's too late. From that day forth, you and your group of friends are trapped inside a dating simulator, as the romanceable waifu's. Will you escape and make it back to the real world? Or will the protagonist get to you first? Visual novel games and dating simulators have been part of otaku culture since long ago. Don't you think it's time to see things from the perspective of the waifu? This game contains mature subject matter and should not be played by children, or those who are highly sensitive to topics such as violence, sex, or mental health. Game length: 2-3 hours Gameplay: Mostly decision menus, however, there are 2 quizzes, and a turn-based fight incorporated into the story. Endings: There are two main endings to the story. A good ending, and a bad ending.",
