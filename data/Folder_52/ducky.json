    "About the game": "* Help save Ducky's siblings in this fun, adventure. * Jump your way through levels full of traps, enemies, and goodies. * Flick switches, collect the keys, open the doors and let those siblings out! Ducky is inspired by 2D scrolling platformers of the 1980s and 1990s. Gameplay elements might seem familiar to fans of games from that era, such as: * environments that scroll up and down, not just sideways * various weapons each with a unique effect * floating platforms * points to collect * switches to activate * keys to find * doors to open * siblings to rescue! With each level a new puzzle to solve, Ducky is heaps of fun. It will keep you busy for hours.",
