Developer note: 'Having previously worked on 2D point and click projects, this is my first ever Unity (and 3D) game so I have used a racing kit template to help me get started and to understand the engine. Naturally, it is going to go about as well as a 'first time' goes in most scenarios... But I thank you for your support!' - Mark JL And more from this developer: /",
