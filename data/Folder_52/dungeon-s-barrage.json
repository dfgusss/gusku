    "Name": "Dungeon's Barrage",
    "Release date": "Dec 21, 2017",
    "About the game": "Try to not die, collect the special orbs for more firepower and kill everything in sight, basically. Since it is a bullet hell game in a endless scenario, just torn everything down while trying your best to survive to get the highest score. Longer survival will increase enemy spawn rate and consequently the difficulty. Hard and insane mode awards more score points per kill, but will have a lot more enemies spawning. The controls are pretty simple for most characters: AWSD: Movement Left shift: Special (a powerful spell). Space: Look further. E: for most other classes specialties (priest blessing, for instance) The engineer is a special case since it uses the right mouse button and left control to spawn a damage buff and attack speed buff respectively. Engaging fast-paced combat! Simple, eye-catching low poly action! Two normal difficulty levels and the Insane mode for the most daring of players! 6 Different classes with varying gameplay! Challeging pastime while queueing for other games! Op characters with lots of RNG involved! Op characters with low RNG! Leaderboards Expect Dungeon's Barrage to basically be a replayable pastime for long queue games or try to enter the top 5 of the leaderboard or to just kill things with your favorite class after a long day at work. If you have found any bug please let me know so i can fix it as soon as possible. The game at moment does not support joystick controls, but i'll try to implement it since some people requested. Thanks for the support and i hope you enjoy the game. :) You can contact me about any bugs, suggestions or feedback, i'll try to read and reply as soon as possible.
