    "About the game": "Join us on Discord for support, offer feedback and SFW/NSFW examples. Do you enjoy collecting figurines or maybe you'd like to, but you don't have the space or time? Ever want to pose figurines or create rich dioramas that can showcase them alone or interacting with each other? Figurine Scene Simulator (FSS) is a sandbox game where you can customize figurines into characters and build scene compositions for them when you: Choose figurines from a huge library spanning over a dozen genres Select from an initial dozen scene settings Pose figurines in the scene using animations and movement/rotation and scale tools. Use blendshapes to further customize the look and feel of the scene with figurine mood expressions (currently available on a small but growing number of figurines) Once you've added figurines to a scene, you have options to : Name and save them to create characters for your character portfolio Manage animations for each character with the ability to create a timeline with animations played in full, clipped to a specific time period or paused on an animation frame for a specified duration. Let the scene's figurine/character animation timelines play in sequence or randomly Capture Scenes, characters and animations in Mp4 and Jpeg formats. Premium Character Unlock DLC With the FSS Premium Character Unlock, you can create even more highly customized and detailed scenes by unlocking: Hundreds of additional figurine variants of the promo and base game figurines Ability to enable/disable clothing and other components for a large share of the figurines Ability to modify the body shape blendshapes for many of the figurines (these a separate from the expression blendshapes in the base game) Animation Poses, animations frozen in time and sometimes paired with another mirroring poses for a second character. This allows for quick posing in scenes and since many are couple based, poses cover situations we don't currently have animations for. Note: To provide a demo of what type of content the premium content unlocks, the base game includes a few unlocked characters, you can find them by clicking the 'Premium Unlock Demo' button displayed during 'Add Character' mode. ******************* Figurine Content Figurine Scene Simulator is based on a large collection of figurines. Pop into the series of franchises covering a wide range of genres and check out figurines from different collections in each genre. Currently, we have over 150 figurines with a growing number with expression blendshapes and you can pose them in scenes using thousands of animations and pre-set poses. The Premium Character Unlock adds an additional 200+ variants as well as hundreds of clothes and body components, and body part blendshapes. (horns, armor, etc) The vast majority of our figurine content will be included in the base game, for example, figurine DLC packs we might have released over the next couple of years while we are in early access will all be included. The exception to these are our small Promo Packs DLC. Promo Packs are small 1-3 figurine sets that add small extensions to the base content. The majority of Promo Packs are by designated spotlight artists and we give them a royalty gratuity for each sale, we will also have promo's released occasionally for a specific theme, such as our Launch Promo which features a mini-scene and 2 supporting figurines. Like physical collectible shops and stores, we get our figurines from a variety of artists and sources including stores like cgtrader and relationships with artists through patreon or directly. Some artists build their models from the ground up and some start with bases from character development tools. As such, not all figurines have a similar look and feel or the same features, and since they don't all have the same rigging, not all animations may look right on all figurines. We think that's part of the nature of collecting figurines and there's options like camera angles and other scene direction methods to make them look great or create specific artistic expressions by purposely playing off their contrasts. Digital Rarity Collector's Program Our Digital Rarity Collector's Program is intended to add a collectable rarity aspect to the game to reward long time players with some inexpensive content which goes up in price slowly, making it less likely other players who join later will be creating photobooks, etc with them. The system is designed so each time we release a new promo, it will drop at the lowest price you can set on steam (in USD), and we will also increase the price of another previously released promo by 1-3 steam price categories.",
