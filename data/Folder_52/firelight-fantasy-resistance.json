Collect all the fragments and use this energy as you want - for the benefit of civilizations or however you may desire. it's up to you! CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE PAST AND THE FUTURE The peculiarity is that the fragments reached the Earth at different intervals of time. How many such fragments, are still unknown, but it is assumed that most of them reached the planet in the distant past. Different generations are trying to get these 'gifts' from space, however, it’s never easy. WITH SHIELD AND SWORD Enough talk, it's time to get down to business and begin the search! This time you have to make your way through forests and fields under snow cover. But it is not enough to walk the path, you also need to resist the same hunters, like you, who crave the same. GAME FEATURES: 10 levels with a story Spectacular battles Procedure-generated worlds Different types of weapons and types of attacks Souls-like system Stunning soundtrack",
