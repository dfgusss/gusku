    "About the game": "Fluttabyes is a bright, cheerful, and fun take on a 'Match 3' game. Easy to pick up and play, and thoroughly addictive! Your aim is to help the butterflies fly away by matching 4 or more of the same colour. Earn score multipliers by creating matches very quickly. If you match more than 6 butterflies you will earn a ladybird. If you match more than 9 butterflies, you will earn the magical rainbow butterfly! There are different modes of play: SURVIVAL - Race against the dandelion clock and earn more time by freeing butterflies. ENDLESS - There is no time limit so you can perfect your match-making skills. There are online leaderboards for each mode so you can compete with other 'Fluttabytes' around the world! Can you beat the number 1?",
