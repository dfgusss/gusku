    "About the game": "Fort Triumph is a challenging fantasy turn-based tactics game where permanent death is a possibility at any moment. How's that for pressure? Lead a band of heroes with different skill sets through a witty, parody fantasy plot. Missions with various objectives are waiting for you on tiled procedural maps—whether in story mode or skirmish, prepare yourself for a grand adventure. Utilize your surroundings: Every tree or boulder is a potential weapon in battle. Strategize: Choose between four factions and four classes. Build your base, gather resources and teach your characters new skills! Grow your heroes: Gain traits and cross-class skills to make your heroes unique every time you play! Explore procedurally generated maps: Fort Triumph features flexible world maps with variable locations and events. Each battle calls for a new plan. Turn up the volume: Marco Valerio Antonini, an award-winning composer, created the original in-game music.",
