As for whether the audience will deliberately mislead the streamer, or the streamer could look through the large number of chat, to find the chat those help them sincerely. Or can the streamer establish a powerful way to communicate with the audience, and use timely and efficient communication to, finally, get the head back upon the body before everything goes awful. That definitely would be an interesting question. Game Features Short but funny 30 mins adventure. Puzzles and levels greatly challenge the friendship between streamer and audience.
