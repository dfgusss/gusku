    "About the game": "Game Character Hub: Portfolio Edition is the ultimate program for creating and editing 2D game assets. It provides a built-in generator for character and tileset creation. While the program was made to be compatible with RPG Maker XP, VX, VX Ace, and MV the elements found in the program should work with other 2D game engines as well. RPG Maker assets are for RPG Maker use only. New and Improved Game Character Hub: Portfolio edition picks up where it's predecessor left off and features multiple improvements, enhancements, and brand new features! Here's a quick overview: Character Creation Easily create characters by choosing generator parts provided in the program. Simply select a template, add items and you're done! You can also create your own custom templates and parts. Note that almost the same logic applies to tilesets, so it doesn't necessarily need to be characters! Flexible Layers You can easily customize parts according to your needs; such as changing the opacity, renaming, merging and deleting parts. Animated Previews The Preview window lets you see whats going on without having to stop what you're doing! You can pause the animation and change different settings such as the animation speed, background color and even zoom! You can also set custom animation previews with the Animation Management feature. Useful if you want to see if your Autotiles or Behaviour poses seamlessly transition to one another! Powerful Palette Editor With our palette editor, it's easier for you to create your own palettes and change values. What's more is that you can generate palette colors from all visible layers or specific ones. Great for finding the colors you need! Complete Item Collection Our huge collection of items makes creating your dream character easy! Mix and match pieces and build your own heroes! Powerful Random Character Generator Need to generate a bunch of NPCs quickly? No problem, use Game Character Hub: Portfolio Editions to create a huge variety of different characters combining our huge library of items. Other Features Include: Tileset Merging Tired of manually merging tile sheets on your own? Game Character Hub has a built in tileset merger to save you the work! Character Format Conversion Game Character Hub allows you to easily convert your character assets for different RPG Maker engines. Flexible GUI layout Change the layout of the program to your liking! Expansive History Window Easily undo and redo artwork at any point in time during development.
