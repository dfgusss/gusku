Defeat your bosses, take their weapons and use them against your enemies! Fight for a world, where Bosses, Landlords and the concept of private property are only a distant memory. Fight for the People! Choose your path! Every Boss needs to go, but the order in which they have to be removed is totally up to you. Will the elusive Vintage Prospective go first? Or will you choose Retro Schwan, the most evil and conservative boss of them all? It’s your decision! Take their powers! Take your bosses’ tools and use them against them! There’s no limited ammunition in GB Rober, so use your weapons as much as you like! Push back Get stronger the more you get hurt! Charge up a meter by getting hit, or by destroying enemies and spend it to heal yourself, or to exchange it for a gigantic damage boost when you are on the brink of death! Change the system GB Rober features a plethora of gameplay modifiers and assist options. Change the damage enemies do to you (you can even increase it, if you really want to), change how much damage you deal, change the way stage hazards work, or just remove all enemies from the game!",
