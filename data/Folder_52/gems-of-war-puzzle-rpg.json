Terrific find!” “I think this is the best 'match 3' game out there. It's got a ton of RPG elements to it that makes it very deep. It reminds me a lot of Hearthstone.” “Got to love a good mix of bejeweled and magic the gathering in an app. Love it!” “Basically this game takes my favorite elements of Ascension and Hearthstone and gives them a different, and I think improved, foundation.” “My wife teases me that Gems of War is Candy Crush for boys. It's an intriguing combination of a gem game and a collectable card game. I like the campaign and the guild play.” “This is like the version of Puzzle Quest I never knew I wanted. Oodles of quests, challenges, guild activities, cool monsters, arena fights, ranked fights, and man I could just play that treasure mini game all day.”",
