    "About the game": "GROUND-UNBOUND Is a procedurally generated high-intensity movement shooter with a retro wave art style. It features roguelike mechanics with several skills, guns and abilities to play with, including a variety of enemy types to shoot at. It was originally made by me, solo, in the 7-day BigFry game jam, in Unreal Engine 4, this version is the expanded and overhauled version, featuring more content. Roguelike This is a roguelike, so be prepared for the usual, procedurally generated levels, stacks of enemies, and perma-death, no surprises here, except for the fact that to progress, you must take a leap of faith of the edge of the world. Guns Use a range of satisfyingly visceral guns to eliminate zombies that drop like a sack of potatoes to your bullets, from SMG's to LMG's, ARS, and more, you're sure to find a gun that will suit your play style. Enemies Fight several enemy types, all requiring a different strategy to take on, flying, shooting, sprinting and even exploding, you'll need to keep your wits about you. Abilities Purchase and use several unique abilities to assist your fight, each catering to a different play style, whether or not ability is useful, is up to you, chain abilities together using secondary to further cater your gameplay. Skills Increase your damage, move speed, jump height, and health to become a walking tank, speed demon, pure damage or any other combination. Progression Finely balance your spending across different chests, upgrading your skills is as important as trying a new gun or buying a new ability, make sure to prioritise correctly, as being too weak in an area could cause your death.",
