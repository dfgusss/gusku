    "About the game": "HopBound is a story-driven psychological horror game that revolves around the surreal mind of Mayumi, a recluse who must journey through an unsettling retro game to come to terms with the ghosts of her past. Through 16-bit horror platformer stages and endless runner levels with gorgeous pixel art, she discovers that her sanity will be tested by something lurking behind the screen. NOSTALGIC VISUALS Most of the game's stunning visuals use a palette of only four colors to evoke the retro charm of 90s handheld games. SPINE-CHILLING AUDIO Listen to unique ambient music that provide a sense of dream-like dread as you explore the game's sinister levels. A STANDALONE CONTINUATION Taking place two years after the events of DERE EVIL .EXE, HopBound serves as a continuation of that story. However, users do not need to play DERE EVIL .EXE to immerse themselves in HopBound's narrative experience. HEART-POUNDING MONSTERS Enemies from previous games are brought back to life and have evolved into new incomprehensible forms. MEANINGFUL MACHINATIONS Going against sequel conventions, HopBound doesn't go bigger and badder for the scale of its story. Instead, the game focuses inward, resulting in a haunting yet meaningful tale. HopBound has NO controller support. Please unplug any controllers before playing this game as it may cause movement issues for the player character.",
