    "About the game": "Hypoxia is an exciting and interactive fiction video game where YOUR DECISIONS will change the story. SYNOPSIS Since the Z gas appeared in the atmosphere 99 years ago, it is no longer possible to breath properly outside. As a result, almost all modern societies collapsed during the oxygen wars. On the Orbis Island, people survive thanks to a dome maintained and supplied with clean air by the Massive Air Company. However, the origins of the catastrophe remain unknown and the island suffers from a great political instability. Carl Thanavan is a young scientist living in the Dome and determined to find the truth. As he accepts to host his sister’s friend Shaimaa, he doesn’t think that this decision will force him to put aside his ambitions and face his fear of the outside. On his journey, he will meet Olivia and take part unwillingly in the beginning of a revolution. He will then realize that the greatest threat for humanity was perhaps not the one he believed. CONTENT « Hypoxia - One last Breath » is the 1st part of the Hypoxia series, an independant visual novel series.
