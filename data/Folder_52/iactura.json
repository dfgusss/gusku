    "About the game": "It is your job to save the planet from its decay. Only you can prevent an extraterrestrial species from taking over all of humankind. How? By shooting them back to where they belong - into the depths of hell of course! Features: A normal play mode with a final, great enemy to defeat Unlock 'Hard mode' where endless waves of enemies await you Local coop mode with 3 classes for your partner Each coop class has a unique skill Random spawning enemies in hard mode Random encounters with mini bosses in hard mode Unlock achievements Top your highscore Retro style! So basically, this is a retro themed arcade shooter. You can't learn 100% where enemies will spawn, and most times you will have to react directly to what you are seeing on screen. There is no 'save spot' or something. I will release updates with small improvements, changes or fixes at any time I can. ;D If you have any questions, you can ask me anytime~.",
