The store is your kingdom, and if you run it well you might be able to expand into a larger corporation! If you get it wrong… well, blame it on the economy. Get Rich, Your Own Way It’s your store, and you can sell whatever you want! Want to run a shop that only sells chicken? Do it! Every kind of electronic, and also fresh foods? Why not! Design and customize your store, and achieve your dreams of running a unique emporium of your very own. Make a Customer, Not a Sale The secret is, you need people to choose YOUR location to spend their hard-earned money. What makes your store the best? Do you have the best shelf-stockers in town, or the most convincing salespeople? Maybe you simply have well-targeted online ads. There are many ways to make your store stand out! Watch your customers closely! Study their behavior and figure out what makes them pull out their wallets. Then, do more of it! Turn Employees Into Brand Ambassadors Humanize your brand by hiring humans ⁠— the right ones! Conduct interviews with prospective employees to find the best mix of skills and culture fit. Negotiate salaries, manage shifts, and train people up so they thrive and grow with you Don’t Get Comfortable Why settle for one shop, when you could run a whole chain? Invest money in advertising to bring in greater throngs of customers; rebrand your store’s interior design; and keep optimising stock and pricing to maximize your profit. If it all pays off, you might be able to incorporate and expand into multiple stores across the city! Your Company is an Extension of You It’s your store, and you can run it how you want. Micro-manage every detail and constantly adjust for optimal profit, or just watch the ebb and flow of your perfect masterpiece. You’re your own boss and you can play your own way ⁠— it’s good to be the king. /",
