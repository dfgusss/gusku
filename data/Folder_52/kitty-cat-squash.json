    "About the game": "WHAT IS KITTY CAT SQUASH? Kitty Cat Squash is a super-casual and relaxing tile merge game! Use your paws to slide the adorable cats across the board and merge the cat tiles; when merged, a new cat appears. You will get hooked attempting to beat your highscore, and trying to discover all 16 cats! HOW TO PLAY Basic Game Play Use the arrows to swipe the cats Merge similar cats Scoring For every level of cat, the points for merging them doubles, starting with 1 point When you beat your highscore in a game, you will get a chime, and another one when you discover a new cat Tips Remember the order that cats merge into Try to keep your best cats closest to a corner Use the corners and order to set up merge cascades (don't just swipe willy-nilly!) Try to beat your highscore, and discover all 16 cats Must Follow Rules Have fun! DISCOVERABLE CATS Instead of those icky numbers to look at, you have adorable cats! There are 16 cats to collect, try your best to get them all and learn their stories. Every cat you discover has a name, and a brief description you can find under Meet the Cats ! DARK MODE BACKGROUND Are you a cat? I figured- protect your kitty cat eyes with our Dark Mode Background ! Now you can stay up all night without any pesky humans knowing you are awake causing chaos! AN ADDICTIVE CHALLENGE Easy to learn, hard to master, harder to put down. You would not believe how often we got distracted playing the game when testing changes during development!

Purrrfect for our cat masterminds! UNDO We all make mistakes, so Kitty Cat Squash allows you a single Undo per game. Use it wisely! ADDITIONAL DISPLAY SETTINGS In the Display Settings , you have several options including showing the FPS , adjusting the Game Board Zoom , disabling the Tips at startup, and toggling Fullscreen . This is also where the Dark Mode Background option lives! CONTROLS (BASIC INPUT METHODS) Fingers? Cute little paws? Weird alien tentacle thing? We got you covered! Kitty Cat Squash enables you to control swipes with the On-Screen Arrow Paws , the WASD Keys , Arrow Keys , controller buttons/axes, or... CONTROLS (SWIPE MODE) ... Swipe Mode . In swipe mode, you can use a touchscreen or drag your mouse to swipe. You can also control the distance you have to travel for a swipe to register! CONTROLS (ANIMATION TIME) Want to make swipes faster? Sure! How about super slow? Why not! You have full control over the Swipe Animation Time . In fact, we have also included a Time to Think option; when your board is not very full, your eyes will be darting back and forth like a kitty fixated on a laser pointer, and your animation speed will be very quick, however once your game board starts to fill up, the swipe speed automatically starts to slow down so you don’t accidentally fill your board, run out of valid swipes and loose! ADORABLE! All game art was made by our very talented artist. Each kitty was designed with love, many based on real cats. Let’s be real, the kitties are Adorable!",
