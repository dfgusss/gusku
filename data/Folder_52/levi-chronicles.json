The name Mestreo is not common among other Gods. only 4 of them mention the name. We were able to decipher the names of these Gods. Their names are Eldorat, Prizmite, Demotite and Helit. In the Journal, Plato uses these names to describe four slaves under a Master or Mestreo. I have a feeling they are the 4 gods we are looking for…” -Leviticus Coleman “I am very happy I am able to get this game into the players hands!
