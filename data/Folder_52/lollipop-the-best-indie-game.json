    "About the game": "LolliPop: The Best Indie Game - the best that could have been made by two indie developers that having no development experience, no time, no money or the desire to work and claws instead of hands. We spent 6 long years developing our best game. In the beginning of our journey, one of the developers was a pupil. Sin ce then, he has grown up and became a jobless loser. The musician who wrote the soundtrack already forgot that he had been working with us, so we are not going pay him. Initially, we planned to make a first person strategy (FPS) with AI. Fortunately we changed our mind and decided to make another one pixel platformer with some trivial plots about candies. In prospect we are planning to release a number of DLCs with meager content but it does cost a lot of money. We took the best from misc games of diverse genres, mixed them all together and forgot why we did that. Anyway we ended up with an ultra difficult cake shaped unicorn simulator, which we are very proud of. In this terrific game, unlike all the other games, you can walk here and there, collect candies, pounce on monsters, jump onto boxes and into water, simply jump on the spot to cause a rainbow, you can practically do whatever you want! Also, in this game there is a van man with glasses, and beautiful flowers that are living on their own. Features: Banal story Boring gameplay Graphics from 2003 Pure hardcore A rainbow behind the protagonist Coins Our amazing game earned many prestigious awards whilst developing. Here are only a few of them.",
