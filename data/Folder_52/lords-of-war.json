    "About the game": "Intro: Lords of War is a fast-paced strategic card game that supports real-time PvP battles. Although game design may resemble turn-based TCG/CCG games, game mechanics is more like a real-time 3D card-based roleplaying game – this combination provides an entirely new gaming experience. Gameplay: The decks consist of 30 cards that are automatically dealt during the round, and action points are restored over time. The game is rather fast-paced. Players should not only know their way around the deck but also choose a right moment to deploy cards as there are many factors that affect the outcome of the battle, such as game style, enemy actions and your response to them, and even luck. Average duration of a match is 5 minutes. The cards don't level up, but there are some limitations determined by four races used in the game: Divinities, Human, Undead, and Demons. There also are a lot of neutral cards that can be used. Players get cards in a traditional manner - either progressing through campaign or spending in-game currency which they get after every victory on packs of cards. Some stages of the game are quite difficult and challenging. You will need a decent deck and a bit of luck. The game also supports online real-time duels with other players - the fun never ends as long as there are opponents to compete with.
