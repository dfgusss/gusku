    "About the game": "The ALFINA GAMERS team together with ALFINA WORLD GAME PUBLISHING are pleased to present a unique game experience. Get ready to challenge nature, incredible dangers, serious enemies, and most importantly - yourself . MAN STANDING is a survival game in an open, endless world. The player will have to shoulder the heavy burden of the only surviving person in the world who, in a fit of schizophrenic delirium, walks to places that hold memories of untimely people who left this world. But everything is not so simple - in this dangerous journey evil enemies and anomalies will interfere with you. But you will not let them get in your way! Waiting for you: Next gen graphics on the most advanced engine of our time Deep philosophical plot, understandable not only to everyone Search for your own memories Exciting battles with representatives of the local fauna In-game social interaction, you can leave messages to other players Over forty hours of intense immersive addictive gameplay It may seem that the game borrows many mechanics from another game - we, of course, are talking about Hevy Reyn. But do not rush to judge! Hevy Reyn has a completely different story - there was a detective maniac (sorry for the spoiler!) And the main character was looking for his children. And there it was necessary to pass all kinds of tests and all that. But we do not have such tests, and there are no maniacs either! And we don’t have qte either. And we have a completely different setting - in Hevy Reyn it’s not a post apocalypse, but we have a post apocalypse (when the world is after the apocalypse!) !. Do you remember the moment in Hevy Reyn when you had to drive in an oncoming car to find your son (Sean)? So there you go! We do not have this moment either! Therefore, please do not say that this game is similar to Hevy Reyn - this is not at all!",
