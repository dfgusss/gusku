    "About the game": "Relive the retro Run 'N Gun experience in this tribute to the arcade games of the 80s. Alone or with another player, you must defeat the dreaded General Hector and free the soldiers held hostage. Go through the 11 varied levels and face many enemies, tanks, helicopters, planes... Improve your firepower; use your grenades to defeat the different bosses at the end of the level. Avoid the different traps (mines, holes) and face a capricious climate (ice, lava ...). The game contains 9 levels in 2D and 2 levels in 3D scaling (Space Harrier style). It is possible to play with 2 players simultaneously.",
