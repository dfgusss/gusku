    "About the game": "You’re far from home and you’re all alone, but there’s some soothing music keeping you going and your mood is pretty high. You just have to get off this rock. You are Moonstuck. An intriguing hybrid of ‘rage game’ and chill, wholesome experience, Moonstuck will push you to your limits of endurance, but keep your mind centered and relaxed the entire time. Navigate a huge winding labyrinth of traps and hazards in the safety of your little ship by delicately bouncing your boosts and directions until you’re free. Your boosters won't last forever, so you'll need to carefully and consistently shift a little bit here and there to make your way through. You can do it though, it's fine. With checkpoints, a calm atmosphere and a pastel colour palette, Moonstuck is designed for you to succeed, if only you have the patience. The entire game is available for free, so the only thing you need to spend is your time. Try it out, and see how this strange experiment into the chill, relaxing rage game subgenre plays out for you. See if you can get home. See if you can escape from being Moonstuck . - One-button platform gameplay that is easy to pick up yet hard to master - A soothing chill lo-fi soundtrack that'll keep your mood stabilised as you try and get 'unstuck' - Carefully placed checkpoints so that nothing ever gets too much for you - A rocky terrain in a far off land for you to float, jet and fly through - Hazards and landmarks that will challenge your ability to keep flying - A unique hybrid 2D platforming arcade style between rage game and chill-'em-up - An immediate restart so you won't get too angry - Kinda like the rage games you've played before ( Getting Over It, Jump King ) but way more relaxing - Tough but addictive gameplay - Entirely free!",
