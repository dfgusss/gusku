    "Release date": "Apr 25, 2022",
    "About the game": "Brawl your way across the solar system as nine distinct characters ranging from a sword wielding space acrobat to a fifteen foot tall monstrosity from the ocean depths of Neptune as you explore the intricacies of the unique left/right combat system and witness the achievements of mankind after 200 years in space. The left/right combat adds in new ways to attack and lets players choose between avoiding attacks through movement or standing their ground and retaliating, choosing correctly is often the difference between victory and defeat. Settings range from a technologically advanced Earth to the foggy capital city of Venus to the uncharted and storm ravaged surface of Neptune. Brawl as the snow falls or as the sun shines, crouch to hide in the tall grass or keep to the shadows. In NeverDeath, there is more to think about than just how your character fights. The nine distinct characters have their own distinct play styles and varied speed, health, damage, attack range and health regeneration rates. All these come together to make each character feel unique and powerful. Will you opt for the consistent damage and all around stats of the engineer or frustrate your enemies as an all but impossible to kill reptilian of unknown origin? Will you move in for the kill with dual knives or keep your distance with a trident? Will you subtly outmaneuver your enemies as a sword wielding female ninja or annihilate them before you die as a 15 foot monster that takes constant damage? Buy now to begin your journey!",
