    "About the game": "Polygunners is a cooperative bullet hell game where you and your friends team up to battle evil shapes! As you battle your way through the world, you will unlock better gear and abilities to use against your foes. When you think you're ready, buckle up and take on The Polyqueen, the source of all evil in this land. IMPORTANT NOTE: Polygunners supports Steam Remote-Play, meaning you can play with others over the internet. Simply launch the game, then invite one of your friends to join your instance of the game using the shift-tab menu. The core gameplay is a ability-based twin-stick shooter. You and your party journeys through towns, dungeons, and boss rooms as you find new abilities and gear by defeating enemies and purchasing items from shops. With over 100 items to be collected, you're able to gather the upgrades that fits your playstyle. Each player can make a build that feels right for them. Solo play is supported, but groups of up to four can team up with local-coop and fight through the dungeons as a squad. Playing as a team adds new abilities and mechanical potential to the already exciting gameplay. Do you have what it takes to kill The Polyqueen?",
