    "About the game": "Project Ultra is an adventure game with a kind of humoristic game design/mechanics. In this game, you will work as a physicist in a Norwegian reverse engineering program of alien technology. This game contains references to UFOs and the cover-ups of extraterrestrial life, it will also contain in the future references to alternate/hidden history and even some cutscenes that show a story based on evidence collected from this subject as a whole. (check out my website, there's a list of planned features there) Main features: Get a job at Area 15 Rob a pharmacy and sell drugs to aliens Fly a flying saucer Buy a car Unlock new features and proceed in the story by shooting baskets at Area 15 I'll try to release a larger update at least once every 3-4 months, bug fixes and small detail updates may occur more often. All the main systems have been integrated, so I can now focus on building the story and sometimes make the game mechanics a little better. Before this game comes out of Early Access the buildings and overall world design will be more detailed, the game mechanics will be fine-tuned and any known bugs will be fixed.",
