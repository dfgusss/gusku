    "About the game": "Rat Racer is a physics-based car simulation. This is not a typical arcade game - everything is calculated in real time by the Nvidia PhysX engine, so the drive model is more difficult to learn at the beginning, but it gives you much more satisfaction when you master it over time. All tracks are 'virtual sandboxes' where you can drive everywhere and do anything what your car physics allows. All collisions, jumps, spins are unique due to real time physics and such environment. How to start: The game is hard - on the first try don't push the throttle to the max - just go as slow as possible throughout the first lap to feel the car reactions and then gradually speed up on next laps. Watch out for the driver - if you drive too aggressively it may fall out of the car due to stronger forces. Also, if you didn't care about the engine it can sometimes catch fire - in both cases you have to wait a few seconds. Due to physical nature of the game it's easy to stuck somewhere - in such case don't move for few seconds - you will be respawned. There are many random things which make the racing different every time - AI can sometimes miss the checkpoints so you never know who will win. Car engines can have a failures. The boxes on the road are filled with random stuff - you never knows if it's safe to collide with. The drone-like camera sometimes look at weird angles so you cannot clearly see your position. Some of the track locations are covered by obstructions so you need to use your intuition when your car is not visible for few seconds. There are no bounds on track so beware of the edges - or force your opponent to drive there! Tips and tricks: When you are in air release your throttle - the landing will be safer When your car jumps with slight rotation - align your front wheels with flying direction to land safely When your car spins - tame every ground contact by handbrake - it may help to loose velocity and may prevent your driver from falling out of the car Some of the cars are using freewheel - it's technology from older cars like Saab or Trabant where car does not use engine to brake - that means when you release your throttle the car is still going until you press brake! We plan to release this game with 8 race tracks and 8 cars. There will be also Early Acces release which will contain 1 car and 1 track. Have fun &amp; be stronk!",
