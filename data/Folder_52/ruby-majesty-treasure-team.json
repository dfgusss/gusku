    "About the game": "a tale of teamwork in a broken world It begins at the end. Nothing could have survived the total collapse of spacetime so it's lucky that it was only a near total collapse. Surrounded by a vast ocean of quantum chronographic static Planet Dirt only has a small number of 'stable' dimensional fragments. These little twisted loops of spacetime are full of dangerous traps, distorted technology, and other memetic manifestations of temporal anxiety but at least existence is remotely possible there. The Twin-Hero Puzzlevania Ruby &amp; Majesty: Treasure Team follows the adventures of Ruby and Majesty as they search for timeless treasure and fragments of forgotten knowledge in the most bizarre and hostile reaches of Planet Dirt . No matter what they face there is always one way forward: TEAMWORK ! Solve action based puzzles by coordinating two distinct characters, each with their own capabilities. Ruby the Human and Majesty the Bat must navigate strange environments in search of treasure and the secrets of their world. Control both characters simultaneously and solve fiendish puzzles by pushing blocks, carrying keys, dodging projectiles, fleeing creatures, and always abiding by the Treasure Team motto: PRESS ALL THE BUTTONS! Bursting with action packed puzzles Accessible challenge with a high skill ceiling 60 Frames Per Second Packed with bursting puzzle action Teamwork and compassion 11 areas each with unique hazards Exists in your timeline Nonlinear narrative/setting Many challenges are out there Hundreds of megabytes Treasures are the key to more adventure Diversions and multiple paths Rescue cute characters Unlockable challenges Relax and chat sometimes Information is not reality Planet Dirt needs your help Nostalgia for games that don't exist Editor and Workshop (build and share your own puzzles and adventures)[] Original soundtrack by a 4 piece band that doesn't exist Modeled after the technical limitations of [REDACTED] Square display space prevents reality phase resonance",
