    "About the game": "This is a casual, 3D game with ship battles. The purpose of the game is to reach the all levels of 6 development branches. Advancing in development, ship types are getting bigger and stronger. Development branches: a) Fire power b) Hit points c) Design d) Fast travel places e) Increase chance of winning (at marauding) f) Location of enemy ships There are 24 optional ship designs. More and more silver is needed for development, which can be obtained in three ways: - defeating enemy ships - marauding enemy ships - trading (you can buy and sell goods in different ports at different prices, you can get more silver from buying goods cheaply and selling it costly in another port) There is a world map showing the ports (with prices), the position of some enemy ships, and the position of your own ship (with the points of the compass). You can use a compass and a world map to determine the way you reach the ports and the (displayed) enemy ships. The world map will only show you the position of your ship and your opponents, if it is prompted by pressing a key. You have a limited number of queries, which is reduced for each query, but you get new ones by defeating enemy ships. Worth to count this for good navigation. Features: Ship battles Navigation with compass and world map Trading with different prices (buy cheaply, sell costly) 6 development branches (Fire power, Hit points, Design, Fast travel places, Increase chance of winning, Location of enemy ships) Marauding enemy ships",
