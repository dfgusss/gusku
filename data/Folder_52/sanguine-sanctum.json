It is a short experience meant to be completed in one sitting, taking about 45 minutes to complete. It must grow. It must consume. You are responsible for It. Delve into multiple worlds in search of Offerings. Return with an Offering and witness It flourish. It desires more. Nourish it. There is more to the Sanguine Sanctum than meets the eye. Only the truly worthy can unlock the mysteries of the Sanctum and discover the secrets held deep within. As It grows, so does It's hunger. Feed It more. It is all. It always was. It always will be. It is now under your care. Do not fail It, the consequences will be dire.",
