    "About the game": "Saving Sunrise is a Survival game with a top view. The goal is to survive and wait for rescue. At night, Zombies come out of the woods and want to devour the hero, you need to hold out until morning and clean up the dead, a little respite during the day and night again... You need to collect resources, build your shelter, hold the defense, and also need to make sorties in search of ammunition and medicines. Infected people differ in several parameters, some of them are more contagious and can infect you... if you do not take the vaccine, your health will slowly melt. Zombies are persistent and will try to get you or break your fortifications, prevent them or have to build anew... With each new night, there are more undead and more dangerous specimens appear, more furious, fast and contagious. Kill all the zombies and live until dawn!",
