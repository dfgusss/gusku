    "About the game": "SceneThere lets you create and explore interactive 360-content from exotic places such as Thailand, North Korea and Burning Man. Navigate from point to point in a 360 film just by clicking on the blue hotspots. Using SceneThere's tools anyone with a 360-camera can create rich interactive stories. Together with leading 360 filmmakers we create unique VR-experiences that bridges films and games. SceneThere believes that 360 films can be something more than linear storytelling. That's why we're the first application to introduce the ability to hyperlink 360-videos with hotspots. North Korea: World's first interactive video tour of Pyongyang - the capital of DPRK Burning Man Art Discovery: Experience the art of the biggest counter-culture festival in Nevada desert, America The Borderland: A Nordic festival in the spirit of Burning Man.
