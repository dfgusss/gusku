    "About the game": "A nonsensical, action beat 'em up wherein characters must fight to stay on-screen, avoiding ring-outs. Each character represents a video game category, minus the twin game streamers. There's a move where a character who represents simulation games changes it depending on the time of day it is. There are specials such as using a part of a claw machine to help you catch yourself while you control the claw. Then there's the twin streamers, who can livestream one attack from wherever they left their laptop at. The game features seven playable characters and a varied soundtrack. Features • Single Player • Local Multiplayer (Up to 3 Players) • Arcade Mode - Against a series of opponents • Quick Match Mode",
