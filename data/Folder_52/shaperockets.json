    "About the game": "Three shapes. Two choices. One weapon. Enter a minimalist multiplayer FPS world where you knew the rules before you played the game. ShapeRockets is the world’s first literal online Rock, Paper, Scissors shooter! Choose Rock, Paper or Scissors - and shoot your prey shape or run from your predator shape. After a recharge, you can change your shape on the fly. Float in all directions in dark, minimalist arenas. Light the arena with your shape, your rockets, or the giant explosions from each kill. Jump in and experience action that’s simple, but far from simplistic with the constant standoff moments of rock, paper, scissors. Three hits and you’re dead. Three deaths and you’re out. It’s 'Last shape floating' in ShapeRockets! Play online with 2-8 people. A simple lobby system makes joining a game fast and hosting a game easy. Also, play single player tutorial levels where you can discover a hidden story as you learn the basics. Echohead is a new indie studio from Matt Cox, lead designer of the original Scribblenauts.",
