    "About the game": "This is the first in a series of Arcade games. I want to create small and solid games with simple mechanics, fun and at the lowest possible price for the players, so I created the series of Arcade games. Expect Space Smash to be a small, solid and replayable game. Your only goal is to constantly beat the best score on the board and unlock items, ships and collectibles. Have fun with the game; Alysson Moraes - Moraes Studio   • You are running out of space! Avoid being crushed by the space storm by collecting blue energy Orbs to gain more time and space, beware of the red Orbs. • Get the highest score possible! Get to the podium on the scoreboard and try to stay there as long as possible. • Unlock ships with unique characteristics by collecting coins that appear in the arena.   • Inspired by classic Arcade games, Space Smash is a fast, addictive and retro shoot 'em up! • Steam Achievements and Global Score. • Easy to learn in Arcade style, using only the keyboard. • A wide variety of weapons power ups and enemies. • Steam cloud support. • Survive how much power to get better score in the classic Arcade style. • Extremely simplistic graphics. • Retro sound effects.",
