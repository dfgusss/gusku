    "About the game": "MIND CONTROL DELETE is █ first person shooter where time m░ves only w▒en you move. No regen▒rati░g he▀lth bars. No conv▒nie▄tly pla▒ed am▄o dr▄p█▒■ YOU SHOULDN’T BE HERE. YOU HAVE ALREADY WON. BUT THERE IS MORE. The long-awaited third game in the groundbreaking SUPERHOT franchise - MIND CONTROL DELETE gives you more insight into the world of SUPERHOT, more story, more weapons, more enemies, more purpose, more signature gameplay. Time only moves when you do. Keep dancing the slow-motion ballet of destruction for so much longer than ever before. Built on the foundations of smash-hit SUPERHOT and the best-selling SUPERHOT VR , MIND CONTROL DELETE delivers more of SUPERHOT’s signature power fantasy. Amass an arsenal of new skills and new weapons. New enemies pour in from every direction. You are in complete control as you shoot, slice, and explode your way through dozens and dozens of increasingly challenging and varied combat encounters. The closer you get to the core, the more powerful you become. Unlock new skills. Uncover snippets of precious knowledge - of the meaning that you crave so much. You begin to believe. MIND CONTROL DELETE Features: More gameplay. MCD is much bigger and longer than its predecessors. Become immersed in the SUPERHOT universe for increased understanding and extraordinary slow motion combat. More mechanics at your disposal. Experiment with new play styles, new weapons, different character builds and fresh tactics to outsmart and dominate your enemies. More bosses, enemies and characters to control. Test your arsenal of tricks and weapons against increasingly deadlier, smarter foes. More progression and power to accumulate. Amass skills, hacks and special techniques to conquer ever more dangerous enemies. More polish applied over nearly four years of Early Access development. MCD offers a more refined, sharper, flashier experience than any SUPERHOT so far. More story. More lore. More meaning? You shoot and slice. You move forward. You repeat. You repeat. You repeat. It becomes a ritual. It starts to mean something again. You take a moment to consider. You’ve been here before. So many times. Maybe this time it will actually mean something. Everything explodes into action. You hope this time will be different. Is this VR? Will this be VR? MCD is a regular, non-VR title. It’s designed for conventional screens and longer play sessions. If you played and enjoyed SUPERHOT VR, you’ll have a blast playing the original SUPERHOT and MCD as well SUPERHOT: MIND CONTROL DELETE started out life in Early Access. With many thanks to our wonderful players, Kickstarter Backers, and Early Access community, we couldn’t have done this without you, Thank you, SUPERHOT Team",
