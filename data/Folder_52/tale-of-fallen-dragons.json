    "About the game": "Long time ago, there were nine sons born from Legendary Dragon. These untamed dragons had bullied around and caused massive damage to the land since their birth. To end this chaos, the descendants of Five Elder Tribes joined together and released a powerful imprison spell. Finally, the dragons were defeated and kept under the Fallen Dragons Temple. Those stories of nine dragons slowly faded from people's memory after several decades. Yet in the dungeon beneath the Fallen Dragons Temple, a new legend just begun... Game Features is a Roguelike game based on ancient Chinese story. In the game you will experience: ----More than 180 different items, which will have even more combinations. ----Randomly generated maps, every battle is a new challenge. ----Various sons of the Dragon, none of them is the same, and none of them is like the Dragon you have ever known. Origins After we finished our last game, we`re considering how to make something special on Chinese Culture. In other games and comics, such as Kongfu and the Four famous novels are already very common to see. But there is still a lot to be discovered. Finally, we choose “Artifact” as our theme, and make our story based on “Nine sons of the Dragons”. So, here comes Tale of Fallen Dragons, a different Chinese style game. Hope you`ll enjoy it.",
