    "About the game": "The ancient land was in turmoil, and the root of all this was because of the evil tower. In order to save the world, countless monks decided to go down the mountain and flatten the pagoda named 'Taoyao', and return a jade to the world. And you are the one with the most potential. TaoYaoTa is a hardcore luck tower climbing game. Strategy and luck will determine the course of your adventure as you play an immortalizer who kills demons and saves the world. You will encounter a total of 9 levels of TaoYaoTa, each level of 9 short stages of adventure, every exploration in the tower will affect your life or death. The game uses an automatic save mechanic, which is saved before each exploration. You will fight with many monsters in Pagoda, and you may encounter strange animals from ancient times, such as captive ox and phoenix. Virtue items, weapons, armor, everything you collect in the tower will show up on you. TaoYaoTa is a Roguelike game. When your character dies, your last play is recorded and you start again with your character. TaoYaoTa is powered by RPGMakerMV. We show you the new possibilities of RPGMaker through this lightweight work. This is the seventh game of the SleepAllday studio, and the second game under the leadership of Taoyao. We hope you enjoy the game.",
