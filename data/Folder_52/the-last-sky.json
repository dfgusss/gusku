Through its meditative, dreamlike atmosphere you are invited to embark on a journey into Jake's mind, contemplating the opposites of life &amp; death, fear &amp; love, and loss &amp; hope. A visual odyssey about the beauty and sorrow of life, explore Jake's past, present, and future, as you progress through the mysterious multi-branching storyline. Enter a surreal dream world, where to overcome the past, Jake must reconnect with the present and the choices that you make will lead to one of several uniquely crafted endings. The Last Sky combines 3D puzzles with 2D platforming inside a beautifully visualized world where the boundaries between dreams and reality dissolve as you become Jake's rudder in an uncharted ocean.",
