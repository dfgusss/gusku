    "About the game": "The Last Sovereign is an adult fantasy RPG that plunges you into the saga of a world torn between forces of lust and purity. As you enter the complex conflict, you forge a new path that will change the course of history! ...maybe. The thing is, acting like most heroes gets you killed, and most evil overlords' plans make no sense. The Last Sovereign is a game that twists your expectations for adult games, while fully embracing a reconstruction of some familiar old tropes to provide a lot of fun, sexy content. By telling a story that has sex as an integral component, The Last Sovereign offers a deep storyline that naturally includes sex scenes. No need to grind for hours or lose to every enemy to find the content. Not only will you adventure in a world where sex is a weapon, you'll build a harem of fully-realized characters with their own reasons for being with you... in and out of the bedroom. Features Over 50 hours of gameplay. Over 200 sex scenes, currently being illustrated. Over 50 fully illustrated scenes, including over 150 images total. Manage the differing opinions and priorities of 20+ harem members. Invest in over 140 different assets that have an impact on the plot and provide returns as the story progresses (Chapter 1+). Negotiate deals between kingdoms and organizations, shaping the course of nations and religions (Chapter 2+). Upgrade and customize a home base (Chapter 4+).",
