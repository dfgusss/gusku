    "About the game": "The Lightbringer is a poetic adventure/puzzle platformer with light combat elements, set in a beautiful world claimed by a vile corruption. Guided by your sister’s spirit, you must prevail where she could not. Cleanse the corruption, become The Lightbringer. The world is under siege by a malicious corruption, targeting the ancient monoliths that gave power and light to these lands. As the chosen one, you have the ability to harness pure light energy from the air, energy that will aid you in cleansing the monoliths to bring back their light. Explore, jump and fight your way through each level while gathering light motes. Every level functions like its own little world, and you’ll need to venture off the beaten path to find enough to cleanse the level’s monolith. KEY FEATURES: Old School Adventure The Lightbringer draws a lot of inspiration from earlier Zelda games, and is all about invoking that feeling of wanting to explore every nook and cranny. Semi-isometric Gameplay With a rotatable camera in an isometric view, you’ll need to look at things from many different angles in order to find solutions to your obstacles. Remember: There’s often more than meets the eye… A poetic journey Your sister’s spirit guides your entire journey, narrating the gameplay entirely in verse. Hazardous Dungeons Explore dark dungeons full of danger. Watch out for traps, secrets and that pesky slime!",
