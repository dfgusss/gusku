You fill the shoes of Jack , who has been sent to find a missing coworker, only to become trapped within the rotting husk of a long abandoned estate. As you are thrown through diverse locations and horrific events, you must try and survive as the light grows faint, and the grotesque cracking in the distance grows ever louder. You're in their world now. And they're coming for you... Gameplay Light is your lifeline, how you choose to use it will often determine if you will survive, or be dragged into the darkness never to be seen again. Use lights in the environment to your advantage, be it simply to see, or to slow down the countless horrors that hunt for you in the darkness. Make your way through dark hallways and unstable caves, eerie cellars and flooded tunnels. The pressure rising as you cling desperately to the light, hoping that your escape lies just around the corner. Gather items and interact with objects for various purposes as you try and find a way out. Discover tools that allow you to overcome obstacles and progress into new areas. Find fuel and new light sources with unique uses as well as healing tonics to dull the pain. ‍ Think ahead when gathering items, the further you delve into the darkness, the more and more rare items become. If you run out of light down in the abyss, they will tear you apart. Journals may be found that give you insight into the turmoil to come, or simply reveal the history and secrets of this place long forgotten. Some may even contain items that help improve your situation considerably. Do you have what it takes to brave the darkness?
