    "About the game": "A narrative heavy, story-driven RPG Enter the role of Maxis Summers, a junior-level researcher working on an illegal AI development project. When he signed up for the job, he didn’t expect to be working underground, away from his wife and daughter. He also certainly didn’t expect to have to deal with the risk of a technological singularity. The Singularity Wish is a game about the choices we make. There are no puzzles or combat, instead the player is confronted with the consequences of their actions… or inaction. Game length is anticipated to run 1-2 hours. Features Hundreds of lines of dialogue, the context of which depends on the choices you make A personal story revolving around the technological singularity Five different endings, with 15 different variations of the player character's ultimate fate About us The Singularity Wish is the first installment of the A Memory of Eternity series, which is developed by a one-man team in RPGMaker MV. A Memory of Eternity is about a post singularity world, but really, it's about more than that. It's about free will and determinism, the thin line between democracy and totalitarian rule, and the basic universal concepts of order and chaos. But mostly, it's about who we are in the dark, and what kind of choices we make. Price commitment So why $1.99 USD? I believe in a commitment to the players, both in quality and in value. I believe that no gamer should ever feel like they didn’t get the value they expected for a game, especially when it comes to a digital product. As a hobbyist dev, I am not bound to shareholders to deliver profits - I make games because I want to. And I release games because I want others to enjoy them. This is something that the wider AAA games industry has forgotten. Instead of draining every last cent with DLC and loot boxes, I create finished games for a decent price. If at any point you are dissatisfied, please request a refund.",
