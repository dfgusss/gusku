    "About the game": "Ticktock is a deceptively fast-paced arcade action game. Think fast; every fleeting second may be your last. Survive waves of monsters. Survive all 11 stages. Survive until the end . Ticktock is a unique action arcade avoidance game, where time pauses to give you a moment to evaluate the situation and plan your next move. With five different monsters to fend off, and 11 different stages of increasing difficulty, a great challenge lies ahead. Each stage and monster is uniquely hand-crafted to be predictable, yet complex. Six different pieces play alongside each stage, complementing the aesthetic of the gameplay to form a complete experience. Will you be able to survive? How long can you survive?",
