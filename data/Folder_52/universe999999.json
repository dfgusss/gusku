    "About the game": "Where did the universe come from? It has always been a mystery, and the concept of our culture has not escaped the notion of beginning and ending conceptually. What was it at the beginning? In recent years, string theory has provided a high-dimensional assumption, but the problem has not yet been achieved. Where does the higher dimension come from? I think it is difficult to explain, but if the universe has no end, and there is no beginning? If the origin of the universe is out of nothing, is it void? Who laid the rules? So we created gods, but who created gods? Damn this is endless. So I stopped thinking logically and think philosophy about it. Yes, it is. It stops right here. The players are the gods of the universe. The main equation of this game is assuming that mass is space, space is mass, and mass itself is also energy, and needs to be filled at all the time, so the universe will shrink and extend continuously with time. From another point of view, it is cooling down. I think that the universe will be in a state of static finally. The average space density will be very low and it will approach to 0. There are no dark matters or dark energy in it. Perhaps this is the way of gravity. The concept is like this. Players play as the god of the universe and control molecules of the universe through gravity string. This is a simulation of theoretical physics. The phenomena in game are controlled by fundamental interaction. There are weak , electromagnetic , strong and gravitation interactions. There are gravitational strings between players and influence each other's universe through quantum entanglement. There is a server at present, but the stability of the network still needs to be tested. Players release energy (mass, space) in game. Every time a big bang occurs or civilizations evolved, players will gain some power from it. These powers are used to generate gravity, and the amount of powers players used. Will be affecting the amount of the gravity. In this virtual 2D universe, we can create countless big bangs. Players can play offline or online whatever you like. In the future, players will be free to create the server of the universe and allow to modify the parameters like coefficients of interactions or color mask. Of course players can modify them right now but it`s a little difficult for most players.",
