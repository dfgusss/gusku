In minutes you can create a building, a piece of furniture, a landscape ... you name it. Hop in and feel your creativity freely flow from your mind to reality. Features: - export to OBJ / MTL for use in Maya or Revit - zero learning curve - design the city of the future in seconds - build custom objects that can be used to create other objects (kit bashing) - tools include: freehand painting, primitives and objects - lights can be placed in the scene and their color and intensity can be changed - if you are adventurous, you can place custom brushes and custom objects (OBJs) into the app's folders to customize the tool - or, create a set of custom objects as a kit and create a kitchen design, or city scape. See what can be done at arcat.com/vr. Show us your projects #VRCAT.",
