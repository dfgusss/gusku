    "About the game": "Your orders are to surrender, but you prefer death to dishonor. Instead, you hold your position behind two bunkers with nothing more than your assault rifle and a bloodlust. Face off against the invaders and survive several waves of attacks. As you take on the enemy, their general will devote more resources to the fight in hopes of crushing you. He will send helicopters, tanks, planes, artillery barrages, and eventually grab his shotgun and come after you himself. What he doesn’t know is that there is no stopping you. Remember that you have allies who will drop health packs and weapon upgrades. Choose between eight possible upgrade paths that best fit your play style. Only you can stand up to them. If you can destroy their army and kill their general, you could end the entire war.
