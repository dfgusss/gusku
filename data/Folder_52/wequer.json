    "About the game": "Wequer is an accessible turn-based tactics game with deceptive competitive depth. Take control of three distinct characters: a unit-birthing Worm, a spell-slinging Wizard, and a monster-killing Warrior. Take down the enemy Worm, Wizard, and Warrior to win. Key Features Play Online: Play against your friends, or random opponents online. Play Offline: Practice against AI controlled bots Build Your Army: Gobble up seashells to create Wormling units. Units are autonomous once created, so no micromanagement. Cast Spells: Defend your allies with a magical shield, rain fireballs down on your enemies, or assemble the pieces to summon an all-powerful demon! Variety: Players purchase spells from the spell shop. Different spells go in and out of stock each turn, so you'll never play the same game twice.",
