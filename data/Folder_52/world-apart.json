    "About the game": "Are you ready to save the worlds? Have you ever remembered something that never happened? False memories seem to be everywhere. You remember one thing, but the reports say something different. Assassinations, war, presidential elections – they all happened but not the way you remember them. The collective recall has changed, and we need to know why. World Apart is an episodic VR adventure game for PC that draws the player into a worldwide conspiracy, spanning eons of human history. Every World Apart episode will deliver a new world to explore, each with it’s own unique story and interact-able environment. Delve deep into the conspiracy, uncover the secrets as you aid scientists, and save your world. World Apart Key Features • Episodic VR Delivery with at least 30 minutes of game play per episode, over a total of 6 episodes. • Explore new worlds in each episode, each with it’s own unique environment. • Fully interactable environments to give a true sense of immersion. • All new content designed and created exclusively for VR play.",
