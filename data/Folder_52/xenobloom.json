    "About the game": "PLAYER - DRIVEN DISCOVERY XenoBloom charges you, an inexperienced demi-god, with the care of a fledgling alien biome. Nurture, harvest, evolve, and sculpt. Create your ideal garden world. Unique to XenoBloom is its use of Cellular Automata to decide if plants live or die; Just watching their behavior can create a trance-like state of wonder. WARNING! XenoBloom contains no running, no jumping, no shooting, no loot, no health, and no shields. XenoBloom has plants. They grow. And sometimes die. (XenoBloom also has bacteria, fungi, and animals, but they are generally referred to collectively as 'plants' for the sake of brevity.) Features: Nurture strange alien life Harvest plants to evolve new life-forms Control the rules of selection and survival Sculpt your world 5 game modes: normal, experimental, observational, ecological, deduction No fail condition Beautiful original soundtrack * Updated Features: Local Co-Op : Garden with a friend or family member Selective Evolution : You choose what will evolve next * New in version 1.6: New game mode: Deduction!
