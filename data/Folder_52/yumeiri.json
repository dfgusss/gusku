    "About the game": "One day, a mysterious package reaches the hero, who is harried by daily life as an adult. Inside the package was a pillow-shaped machine and a letter asking for help. Upon activating the pillow, the hero falls into a waking dream. Forgotten memories from childhood... Even these were but the opening act of the miracle about to begin. After its release in 2015, Yumeiri received acclaim from game magazines, science fiction magazines, and mystery novel magazines. With a very high difficulty, and it gave rise to not a few frustrated players. At the same time, players who accepted its concept of 'taming luck' were impressed as if personally reliving a dramatic life. For the full-scale remake, all scenarios were rethought and some episodes were rewritten. While the original was available only in Japanese, the game has now been produced with a full-scale English version.",
