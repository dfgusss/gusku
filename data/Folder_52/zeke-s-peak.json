    "About the game": "Zeke’s Peak brings the 1983 pub classic into the digital age. The pioneer of the mechanical “bar and ball” game, Zeke’s Peak makes the transition from analogue to digital, taking advantage of the new possibilities this provides while retaining the tactile feel that made the original an instant classic. Zeke’s Peak recreates the classic arcade boards you loved (including Ice Cold Beer!) but keeps the action rolling by introducing over 70 all-new levels with arcade-inspired gameplay. Find yourself rolling your way through several beautiful worlds, mastering new challenges along the way. Relive the glory days, immortalize yourself by competing for high scores, and follow Zeke on his wild adventure. Features: Discover Zeke’s world: Zeke has set off on an adventure. Discover new worlds and challenges to conquer. Follow Zeke’s journey from the Arcade realm into the realms of the Deep Jungles, Vast Caverns and so much more. Evolved Gameplay: Zeke’s Peak is no longer static. Expect new and varied gameplay challenges as you work through Zeke’s world. The introductory levels of the Arcade realm will transition both new and old Zeke’s Peakers from the confines of the cabinet into longer and more varied challenges. Once you’ve become accustomed to Zeke’s new and dynamic levels, you will be ready to conquer new challenges as you work your way through all of the realms. Classic gameplay: Play the original Zeke’s Peak, and Ice Cold Beer classic boards, as well as brand new themed boards that stay true to the classic board gameplay. Competitive play: Levels have the ability to be conquered. Immortalize your name by competing for the coveted high score! Customization: As you progress, you will have the opportunity to unlock new skins to customize your play. Zeke's Peak is developed by 56k Games, in partnership with Taito Corporation.
