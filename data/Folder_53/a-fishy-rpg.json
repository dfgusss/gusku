    "About the game": "A Fishy RPG is a game focused on survival and exploration. It's also a fishing game, in the way that this is the main mechanism to gain experience, improve your stats and progress through the game. The main objective is to find the legendary fishes. In order to do so, you must improve your stats to be able to explore deeper caves and also improve your fishing rod to be able to catch rarer fish easier. Even though the game is built towards a specific story, it also offers the possibility of free exploration in a procedurally generated universe. Features: - Procedurally generated map and caves; - 3.000 unique and procedurally generated fish to catch; - Save and load the game at any point; - Engaging fishing mechanism; - Four playable characters; - Stats to improve (power, defense and speed); - Equipment to improve (fishing rod and gun); - Wild life, besides the fish, to hunt (and be hunted!)... - ... - Eight legendary fish . Regarding the caves/layers, fishing rod and legendary fish You move from one layer to another (deeper caves) through portals. Be sure to upgrade your gun so you can break the rocks to access deeper levels. And, of course, be sure to upgrade your stats before going too deep :). Your fishing rod as well as your current layer/cave determine the range of fish you may catch. Now go catch some fishhhh.",
