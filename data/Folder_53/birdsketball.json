    "About the game": "Birdsketball is a local multiplayer sports game for 1 - 4 players. At the heart of the game are simple controls that require finesse and practice to master. The birds fly and bounce around like tiny dog-fighting planes. Features 2 - 4 player VS mode Single or 2 player coop campaign Collaborative level editor. Play while you edit. First time flyers The controls are simple. But to fly around effectively takes skill and practice to master. Here are some tips for improving your game: Take your finger off the flap button sometimes: You rotate faster if you aren't flapping. Boost into a wall and you will rebound in the opposite direction. Tackle your opponents by boosting into them. Shooting is important, you fly slower when holding the ball. With practice you can perform lob shots, rebounds and passes. Some players prefer to use the right trigger for flapping (not me!). If you hold it just right, you can almost hover on the spot. Make your own levels together: Build a level with your friends using the collaborative level editor. Quickly switch between flying and drawing to test the level as you make it.",
