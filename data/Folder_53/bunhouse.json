    "About the game": "'Bunhouse is just the most wholesome, sweet, good-spirited thing, and its simple joy is a rarity for video games' - Digitally Downloaded 'Bunhouse could prove to be the most wholesome game of 2021' - Destructoid --------------------------- Bunhouse is a cute couch co-hop game focused on growing plants and managing a greenhouse with fellow buns. Sometimes life is hectic. Sometimes we just need to take a breather and relax in a happy little world filled with bunnies. This is the core vision of Bunhouse – a game you can play solo or with your friends to relax and be happy. There is nothing to kill, no one to be better than, no quests or debt to pay off, just some plants that need watering and a greenhouse full of possibility. Important note: if you plan to buy this game so you can use Steam's Remote Play Together feature, the hosting computer may use keyboard or controllers, but the other connected computers will need to have controllers for it to work. This is a limitation of how Unreal Engine handles local play, and there is sadly nothing I can do to change it. Thank you and have fun!",
