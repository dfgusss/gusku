    "About the game": "Catharsis is a character driven dungeon diver where the goal is to explore maze-like environments to collect treasure and return to town alive. Players have control over their character’s classes and gear, and must manage their inventory space as they explore the dungeons and face powerful monsters and ancient horrors. The player characters are a party of Lost Souls that need to venture deeper into the dungeon to defeat the Ancient Horror preventing their rebirth. Strengthen the souls and equipment of your characters and challenge the 3 increasingly grim dungeons against monsters with class archetypes, unique skills and dangers.",
