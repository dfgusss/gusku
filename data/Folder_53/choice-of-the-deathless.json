    "About the game": "Battle demons and undead attorneys, and win souls to pay back your student loans! At the elite demonic-law firm of Varkath Nebuchadnezzar Stone, you'll depose a fallen god, find romance, and maybe even make partner, if you don't lose your own soul first. 'Choice of the Deathless' is a necromantic legal thriller by Max Gladstone, Campbell Award-nominated author of Three Parts Dead and Two Serpents Rise. The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Explore a fantasy realm with a rich and evolving backstory, based on the novels published by Tor Books. Play as male or female, gay or straight, dead or alive (or both). Build your career on carefully reasoned contracts, or party all night with the skeletal partners at your firm. Navigate intrigue and mystery in a world of scheming magicians and devious monsters. Look for love in at least some of the right places. Balance student loans, sleep, daily commute, rent payments, and demonic litigation—hey, nobody said being a wizard was always fun.",
