    "About the game": "THE FUNNIEST PHYSICS-BASED SUMO ARENA EVER! With Circle of Sumo: Online Rumble! you will play as a Sumotori, a sumo wrestler. After selecting your Sumotori, you will be catapulted into one of the crazy arenas of the game, but be careful; don't be fooled! They look harmless, but they hide more pitfalls than you think. Circle of Sumo: Online Rumble! is based on physics and the variety of levels creates a wide range of challenges. Magma, sand, and hatches are just some of the elements that will stand on your way to victory, besides the other huge Sumotoris, of course! Will you try to bring down your opponents with all your strength, will you choose to use your skills to dodge at the last moment, or will you try to leave the other opponents to eliminate themselves? FEATURES: ONLINE MULTIPLAYER UP TO 4 PLAYERS Challenge up to 3 more Sumotoris online, the last to stand in the circle wins the round! Whoever wins five rounds will be the champion of the match. THE FUNNIEST SUMO ARENAS EVER Thanks to physics's importance, it will not be just a matter of power to win; in addition to hitting and dodging, you will have to do your best to survive in the arena. Use the environment to your advantage! RANKED MODE! Challenge yourself, fight other players online, and climb the world rankings. It will take some practice, but the first step of the podium could be yours! 12 ARENAS Fight in twelve different arenas, each with its pitfalls and characteristics that make them deeply different from one another. Master them all, don't be unprepared! EIGHT DIFFERENT SUMOTORIS Choose from eight different sumotoris. They have different abilities! Everyone has a different sprint, strength, or acceleration rating. It is not the Sumotori that chooses the arena, but the arena chooses the Sumotori! TAKARABAKO and MONey Takarabako is the Japanese ancient name for 'Treasure Chest.' In these chests, you can find champions, arenas, and the new emotes! You can buy a chest with MON. Mon is our in-game currency; you gain this currency just playing the game! The more you win, the more MON you gain.",
