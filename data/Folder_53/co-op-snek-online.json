    "About the game": "Classic co-operative SNEK gameplay: Eat dots, get long, don't die. Play together with friends both online or on the same computer. Co-op Levels Eat dots, get long, beat the level Play through tonnes of levels with lots of obstacles and things getting in your way. Try not to accidentally block your friends in. Competitive Levels Eat dots, get long, kill your friends Go through the games levels in a random order while trying to get in the way of each other! Endless Classic Eat dots, get long... repeat Simple empty screen with no obstacles. Get as long as you can and try to beat your previous high score. Online: Just send your friends a game name &amp; password to get playing! Local: Full controller support for 4 players locally Smush all your hands together on a keyboard! (Note, some keyboards do not like this unless you have a 'high-end' keyboard with n-key rollover) Single Player: You can play by yourself, however, this game is really meant to be played with friends! Full controller support so you can play via big picture I want to make online + local co-op games, this is my first attempt. I aimed to make a game that you could put in front of a friend &amp; easily start having fun without lengthy explanations. I hope I have succeeded at least somewhat, please leave a review and give us much feedback as you can, it is very much appreciated!
