Combat Chess includes 3D rendered pieces from a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Pawns become dragons, Knights become real knights, the Black Knight’s turning your pawns to green jelly, and the Queen’s threatening to deliver a majestic head-butt to your king. With over 600 animation sequences, each piece includes 'fidget' sequences for those moments you need to think. The animations include movement, combat, fidgets, and 'check' moves. For the traditional minded, Combat Chess includes a traditional set, also 3D rendered. Two boards come with the game, each assigned to the genre of pieces.
