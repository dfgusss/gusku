    "About the game": "Cubecois is a high-powered arcade style game with easy-to-understand controls and fluid, physics-driven game. Test your gaming skills with Cubecois ! The game is free during the COVID-19 pandemic and it does not contain any ads! The purpose of the game is to avoid the various obstacles while racing through the various areas/levels. The game gets progressively difficult as you get further in the game. There are plenty of skins to choose from and some skins have corresponding voice effects. For instance, selecting the French skin will have voice effects in French (Canada skin has Canadian terms, the England skin has British terms etc...). The wide range of skins are either custom skins or country/region flags such as the flags from: England Canada USA China Russia Iran Brazil Switzerland Australia Portugal Romania Spain Sweden Ukraine Cubecois has no end to it. It is a challenging game but there are many power-ups that show up during the game such as slowing down the speed of the player for a laps of time or reducing the size of the player to make it easier to avoid obstacles. You also have the option to purchase upgrades to give you an edge! The great and upbeat song was created by NIHILORE and it is called 'Resistentialisms'. Try Cubecois today!",
