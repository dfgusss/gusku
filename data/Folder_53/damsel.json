    "About the game": "Cause distress in this fast-paced, challenging action platformer! Speed through dozens of missions as Special Agent Damsel, the first and last line of defence against the seedy world of corporate vampires. Rescue hostages, disarm bombs, hack servers and dispatch the undead with precision, speed, and style. Balance frenetic action with split second choices, and pay attention, you never know where the next vamp will come from. Enter a fully realised comic book world and help Damsel take on Red Mist, the powerful vampire corporation that’s adding a new (and illegal) ingredient to their popular vampire drink. Uncover the secrets of the new recipe and stop the corporation from achieving their ultimate plan, the total dominance of vampires on Earth! Use Damsel’s powerful ultraviolet shotgun, quick reflexes, devastating melee, and lightning fast dash to string together stylish attacks. Tight and responsive controls let you move around each arena while avoiding the deadly hazards fiendishly placed to stop you in your tracks. Experiment with each mission to discover that perfect sequence of moves and attacks that maximise your effectiveness. Master Damsel’s speed and precision to carve the perfect path through each arena, with every move counting toward that perfect score and a place at the top of the leaderboards. Damsel is a ballet, and you’re the choreographer. • Classic Arcade Vibe Bite sized gameplay that’ll make you say “Just one more go” (although you said that a few tries ago…) • Comic Book Campaign Learn the secrets of Red Mist and put a stop to their evil plans. • Competitive Arcade Leaderboards Master your abilities by perfecting your runs and become the top agent. • Chill Out Time Chillout mode lets you take the edge off and enjoy the game without worrying about pesky things like dying. • Extra challenge modes For the discerning slayer, take the difficulty up a notch! • Pumping Synth Soundtrack Gothic grooves to slay too!",
