    "About the game": "New free shooting game. Dark Sun is an Arcade RPG space shooter. Conquer the universe as a tiger alien. Bring in your friends from among the Zylons (praying mantis), Altaren (eagles), Alcorians (ants), Xendoids (Velociraptors), and Slimalacticans (a loose confederation of slimes, amoeboids, worms, fungi, and frungii). What is a frungii you ask? Play and find out. A full 3D MMORPG is also in the works featuring the same races with new spaceships and land mounts. It will commence with the first full 3D PvP map on the Altaren homeworld. This version features a collision-free starship system and an infinite universe. Space is vast! So collisions between starships would be easy to avoid, even in 'close proximity.' This is a teeny, tiny introduction to the above concept with more planned later, something to get your feet wet and help fund future releases.",
