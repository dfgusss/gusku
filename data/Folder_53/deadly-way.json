    "About the game": "Deadly Way is a First-Person hardcore reflex game &amp; The hardest game in the world . Your aim is to complete the level without touching the color red. If you touch anything red you're DEAD. Also be careful and don't rush unless you're very confident in your skill since there are no checkpoints in the levels. If you die, you'll start from the beginning. 20 challenging and some almost impossible levels. No checkpoints. Pride of completing a level.",
