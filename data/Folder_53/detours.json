    "About the game": "It’s time to move across the country, and the only person with a car is your ex-partner. Suck up your pride and play through your trip and relationship’s road bumps, obstacles, and detours. Witty dialogue and moments of quiet, human connection are interspersed on a trip that reflect the oddities and struggles of Midwestern drives. --- Detours was made by Mismatched Games (Autumn Raines, Kinsey Erickson, Roscoe Rappaport, Sam Ortiz, and Plum) as part of Code Coven's 2020 Summer Program. --- HOW TO PLAY: Play as Daniella as you slowly make your way back to her childhood home with help from her ex, Mish, and their car. Use your mouse, arrow or WASD keys to select dialogue options. Click or press space to confirm your choice or progress dialogue. Your progress is saved at the end of each in-game day. You can continue by selecting 'Acts' from the start menu. You can explore pit-stops as Daniella by using your arrow or WASD keys. Interact with people and the environment by clicking or pressing space. Press the Escape key to look at your inventory.",
