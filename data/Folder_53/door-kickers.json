    "About the game": "Door Kickers is an innovative realtime strategy game that puts you in charge of a SWAT team and lets you command them during a tactical intervention. Analyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger. It may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps, that’s a skill harder to master. Quick Points: 2D, Top Down for optimal tactical analysis Real Time With Free Pause No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces Realistic but action packed Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay Mission editor and modability Unlimited gameplay via mission generator and level editor Single Player Online Cooperative Multiplayer (2 players) Read more about the game at",
