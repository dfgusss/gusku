    "About the game": "Welcome to Nappia, the magical land of hopes and dreams taking shape in your sleep. Despite the cozy and relaxing vibe, in this first chapter you're on a mission to deliver the dreams to their dreamers. Assemble, clean, and paint dreams to learn more about the characters and their backstories! Nappia has so much to offer to the newly hired Dream Catchers : - A charismatic guide named Somnio will lead you through the most complicated dreams. - Dozens of unique characters with touching stories to explore and reflect on. - Immersive visual and sound design to bring you into a peaceful and meditative mood. Just try it! - Quirky puzzles based on the objects that connect with the dreamers’ destiny and help you put it right. This place is free of boredom and loneliness. It listens and understands you. Although it is recommended to take essential breaks – the atmosphere of Nappia is so captivating that you won't notice your shift is over. This 30-60 minutes experience will give you a sneak peek into our vision. Dream Catcher is supposed to be greatly influenced by the community. Please feel free to join our Discord server and contribute any feedback and reviews to help us keep Nappia growing! Here's one of the stories for a start: Wakey Wakey Jerry's exploring the jungle when he bumps into a waterfall! The more he looks at it, the weirder his tummy feels… Dream Catcher assembles a snake. Suddenly, a giant snake appears right in front of Jerry! He wakes up screaming, and his Dad takes him to the bathroom just in time. It's your first night, Dream Catcher. Would you care enough to commit to these dreamers?",
