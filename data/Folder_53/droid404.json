    "About the game": "You are a robot labeled Droid404. On the planet Castron, there are many robots that seem to want nothing more than to destroy you. Even though you have not done anything to wrong them since your recent creation, they despise you. Your creator, Fred, has only recently assembled you and given you one important task: retrieve the peculiar energy source from the planet Castron. Before your creation, Fred discovered the strange energy source, and realizing its power, knew he must obtain it first before other more sinister beings. Be prepared to run, jump, and dodge your way through various evil robots in 12 unique and fun levels. Although capturing the energy source seems like the right thing to do, you cannot seem to shake the feeling that something does not feel quite right. Something about the enemies seem... almost... too familiar. How much do you really know about the energy source? Who should you really be obeying? Good luck, Droid404.
