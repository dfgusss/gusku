    "About the game": "Epic Battle Fantasy 5 is an over-the-top turn-based RPG adventure, full of video game references, juvenile dialogue, and anime fanservice (...and also strategic combat, monster catching, and tons of treasure hunting - if you're into any of those.) The massive Version 2 update adds new bosses, more dungeons, customizable challenge modes, collectable monster cards, and much more! If you're new to the series, this is a good place to start, and if you've played the other games, there's plenty of new features for you to explore. Epic Battle Fantasy 5 features... Over 200 different enemies to fight, all with unique abilities and attack patterns. Over 120 usable skills, and more equips than you can try out in a single playthrough. Almost any enemy can be captured like a Pok*mon, and later summoned in battle. (including bosses!) New mechanics also include weather conditions and a cooldown system. (MP is gone!) Set up devastating combos with damage-amplifying status effects. (wet + thunder = massive damage!) 30 hours of gameplay, plus lots of optional dungeons and challenges, which can easily double that. Suitable for both casual and hardcore RPG players, and is safe for all ages, if offensive content is disabled. Epic Battle Fantasy 5 does NOT feature... Annoying random battles. Limited save points. Depressed protagonists. Points of no return.",
