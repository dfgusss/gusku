    "About the game": "Eve of Souls: Static Pod is a pixel game which is made of 10% of horror element, 30% of adventure, 20% cuteness, 20% suspension, and 20% of hard-core challenge. ✿ From the Developers ✿ We’d like to create a non-traditional horror adventure game that allows all gamers to enjoy. Would you like to enjoy an adventure with a cute girl? What secret lies beneath the surface. How will you defeat the fallen? Why use a key when you can kick the door open. ✿ About Early Access ✿ [There’ll are 5 chapters and EA ver will unlock 3 of them. The rest will unlock for free then they are done. Every chapter has Easter eggs and challenges, please don’t miss them!] ✿ Features ✿ *Mild Suspension: It’s pretty mild for the general audience, but if you dig deep, the story may be more than meets the eyes. *Health and Spirit: Get injured you’ll lose health, get spooked you’ll lose spirit. Exhaust either, the character will surely perish. *Character: You can use different approach to let your MC grow, this will let you conquer the levels differently. For example, physical training will buff her and let her take more damage, or even kick the door open. *Lygophobia: The only thing she’s afraid of is the dark. So please, stay in the light. *Monsters: They come in all flavours, some eats your spirit, some eats your soul! *All kinds of solutions: Monsters and mysteries aside, there are other ways for you to solve a problem. When you can power through a hard part, try to think of a more intelligent way. ✿ Salute ✿ The Witch’s House, Yomawari: Midnight Shadows, Corpse Party, Resident Evil, Outlast",
