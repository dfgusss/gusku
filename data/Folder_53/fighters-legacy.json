    "About the game": "Fighters Legacy is a 1 on 1 INDIE CASUAL combat game. No flashy over the top effects, just good old fashioned fisticuffs! This is a indie passion project that was made soon after I finished working on Shaolin Vs Wutang. It is not my intention to provide the same experience as big budget fighting games. But rather I hope to provide players with a satisfying gaming experience blended with nostalgic old school fun. It is being released in early access so i can get valuable support and feedback in order to help the game reach its full potential. With the help of the community we can create the best game possible! Current Features Include Hand to hand combat 15 Characters Multiple outfits and accessories per character 15 Stages Unique moves and combos for every fighter Arcade, Versus, Tournament, Survival, Team battle and Training modes",
