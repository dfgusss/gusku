    "About the game": "Fly By Knight is an action/platformer game where you control an adventurous bird trying to free your helpless critter friends from prison gems created by a dark magic sorcerer. To do so, you must confront enemy minions, besting them with your sword attacks and flying skills. To reach your cuddly friends, you must break through the barriers and beat up the nasty slimes that trapped you in a branch of the tree you once called home. Bounce your way through the mushroom patch, battle your way through the fierce enemy gauntlet, and glide your way through precarious wind tunnels, avoiding the fireball flowers within. If you get hurt along the way, take a birdbath in the healing pool to heal up! If you get hungry along the way, snack on some cherries! Don’t forget to save some for your critter friends! Collect all of them to unlock the true ending… Once your friends are free, escape through the magical portal created by the ancient magic residing in the prison gems combined with the power of friendship. Features Platforming, flying, and combat! 80 hidden cherries to hunt down! Alternate endings! About Development This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
