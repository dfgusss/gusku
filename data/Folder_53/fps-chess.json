    "About the game": "Play an ordinary game of chess against a friend or a stranger. However, all your intricate strategies will crumble before the enemy rook's sniper trick-shot. All your practiced openings and counters will amount to nothing before the enemy queen's randomly sprayed machine gun. You finally checkmate the king. Unfortunately, it seems you are not ready for this fight. 5 seconds in and you've been sliced in half by the king's sword. It turns out you are not playing Chess at all, but an FPS. Just make sure to practice your aim! Features 6 unique piece toolkits with unique weapons and abilities. Online, LAN, and local split-screen 1v1 multiplayer matches. Invite a friend or join a lobby. A fun room to explore during every duel. Custom board editor to play with your favorite pieces. About Development This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
