    "About the game": "Ancient portals have been lying dormant, waiting for daring adventurers to travel between worlds. It took thousands of exotic gems, gathered over centuries, to finally open one of these portals. Your task is to lead an expedition through the portal and protect it from hostile guardian life forms that will try to destroy it. If the portal collapses you will be stranded and unable to send back the gems so desperately needed to open more portals. When you arrive on the planet you must start harvesting resources to build defenses around the portal. Assignment of roles and deciding what to research will be critical to the success of your mission. Although we require a vast number of gems, you will need them to build towers that burn, freeze, shock or disintegrate your foes. It's important to survive, but bring back as many gems as you can, After repelling the last guardian attack wave, the portal will be secure and you may return home to a hero's welcome! Play co-op (up to 4 players) or solo Unique defenders and towers Workers hunt, harvest, build and mine Build Focal towers to protect the portal Towers can be combined to form new types of towers Unlock more buildings, units and items using a Research Tree Assign roles to workers using sliders Workers go about their tasks automatically Attack waves will target the portal Players can trade resources Defeated guardians drop gems Unlock new worlds using gems",
