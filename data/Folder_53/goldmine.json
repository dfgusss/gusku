    "About the game": "This is a game I wrote so that I could have a bit of a distraction at work. The idea is simple, you click to mine a resource, hire workers to do the mining for you, upgrade them, unlock new levels and worker types, gain prestige levels and start over. I used to switch to it about every hour or so, distribute the gold and return back to work. At some point a few of my coworkers noticed and asked to play too. They seemed to really enjoy it, requested new features and reported bugs. Before I knew it, a dozen people in the office were playing. (You might be tempted to tell my boss, but he was playing too and even wrote a cheat.) This was a bit unexpected, but made me realize that people outside of work might enjoy this game as well. After a bit of searching I collaborated with an artist and a composer to help me make the game more presentable. Working on this project was fun and all of us learned a lot. What you see is the result of our efforts and we hope you enjoy it despite its flaws. Thank you!",
