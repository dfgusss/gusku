    "About the game": "The anti-strategy game for unconventional humans. Grand Attrition is an RTS/tower defense survival game with RPG elements that boasts innovative game mechanics where you can take control of everything in battles, from map terrain to enemy units. Combine a wide variety of playable units, side grades, and talents to ensure no battle is the same. Defend! Summon a mosh pit of unique and balanced units to defend your starter unit. Construct bases for your troops by claiming terrain tiles and building walls with different strengths and effects. Pause the game and order your units around during stopped time! We don’t judge. Offend! Attack fortresses and plunder their treasure. Side grade your units in order to preemptively cause plagues and mass vampirism. Summon powerful guardian units to massacre enemy troops before they can even reach your base. Anticonventionalism! Don’t have laborers to gather resources for you? No problem! Just click any resources you find into submission. Click enemy units until they convert to your team, or just click them to death as well. Use special walls to spread map terrain all over the world. Your enemies cannot reach you if there’s a sea of lava in the way. Oh gosh, what? Blood moons dump nasty creatures onto the field who don’t discriminate. DO NOT send any units past the map border. DO NOT. Be careful of any talent points you pick up, champ! Invest in chaos! Crank up different setting to make the game more difficult, increasing your score, which increases how many talent points you get. Use talent points to radically change how you play the game; invest in talents which cause friendly units to reflect projectiles, enemy conversion chain gangs, the unit singularity, gnomes to expel from corpses, and much more.",
