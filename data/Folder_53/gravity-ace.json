    "About the game": "Gravity Ace is a 2D multi-directional gravity shooter (cave-flyer). It's a love letter to Thrust and Gravitar and all of the amazing games they inspired. Descend into dark caverns, fly and blast your way past enemies, retrieve the reactor core and make your escape, all while fighting the deadly embrace of crushing gravity. Do you have what it takes, pilot? You are the Pilot, a volunteer in the United Earth Navy, assigned to the U.E.N. Hornet, a new ship with an experimental engine that allows it to warp behind enemy lines. Launching your small fighter craft from the Hornet, your mission is to sabotage the enemy by raiding their bases and disrupting their power supply network made up of reactor cores connected through hyperspace. FAST-PACED ACTION There are plenty of enemies and they are out to get you. Fly, fight, and maneuver through dangerous enemy bases and intense gravitational fields. The core game includes a 24 mission single-player campaign and a level editor for creating your own scenarios. SCAVENGE ENEMY FUEL Your ship is powerful but has a limited fuel supply. You'll need to scavenge fuel from the enemy to survive. Fuel management requires careful maneuvering and using momentum to conserve enough fuel to escape the gravity well. PHYSICS-BASED GAMEPLAY Everything that moves is part of the physics simulation. Momentum and velocity can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Use your tractor beam to steal the reactor core, rescue astronauts, or hurl nearby asteroids! STEAL THE REACTOR CORE Your ship is equipped with a powerful tractor beam for carrying large objects. The objective of each mission is to extract the enemy reactor core in one piece. Secondary objectives include destroying all enemy units and rescuing astronauts. Be careful -- the reactor core is heavy and fragile! LEVEL EDITOR All of the levels included with Gravity Ace were made with the built-in level editor. You can make your own campaigns, stories, and challenges. And during Early Access, we're adding the ability to share levels with the community. ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK Gravity Ace includes an original soundtrack with 20 minutes of music.",
