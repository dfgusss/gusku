As long as the computer's performance does not reach its limit, the game can continue forever. Shortcut Key R: Quickly Build Buildings in batches Press the R key on the keyboard in order to 'repeat the last building construction'. For example, you want to build a certain building in batches. You don't need to click the build button back and forth, and then select the building to build; You only need to press the R key after completing the first building, so that you can quickly build the building in batches. Dynamic Balance of Resources Including population and money, 18 resources have been designed. Constructing a building requires consumption of resources; The completed buildings will also consume certain resources all the time; In this way, the building can continuously produce a certain resource. The core of the game is to maintain a dynamic balance of resources while keeping resources growing.
