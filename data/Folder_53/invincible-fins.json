    "About the game": "A game recommended for younger kids. You control a little fish that just got back to the ocean from a thrown away aquarium. Explore the colorful underwater world, collect treasures, avoid dangers and find your new home. - No menus, just hit the play button (Space / A on controller) and continue where you left off - Saving is automatic between scenes and upon exit (Alt-F4 or Esc) - No violence, even the sharks are not deadly, they just make the player flee home. There is a penalty though, you lose all the collected treasures from the inventory. - No tutorials, you have to figure out what to do - watch out for indications shown by Ollie, the crab - No rush, play at your own pace; there is no time limit - Secret Area - Playable by controller or keyboard Controls - Start Game - Space button / A on Controller - Exit Game - Alt-F4 / Esc - Move - Arrow keys / D-Pad / Left Stick - Short Sprint - Space button / A on Controller while moving - Blow Bubble - Space button / A on Controller while not moving - Drop Item - Enter button / B on Controller - Change Player Character - X button / X on Controller (only in secret area while over another fish) There are three little fish that follow you - One helps to spot treasures - One always swims around you so you can find yourself more easily on the screen - One is controllable via the W, A, S, D keys or a second controller, but it can only interact with the beach ball - this allows 2 children to play together or a parent to play with their child",
