    "Name": "Kittens of Fear",
    "Release date": "Dec 25, 2020",
    "About the game": "Ulysses was a hard-working, upstanding young man whose life ended far too soon. Like a few others who perished due to appalling factory conditions, his soul could yield no peace without a chance at revenge. What better way to hurt a conscienceless materialist like Mr. Carne -- the factory owner -- than to pilfer his prized possessions? But Mr. Carne has a surprise defense force even against restless spirits. The ghastly creatures that protect his rooms are rumored to be known as... What Is This Foolishness? Kittens Of Fear was initially a 'demo pitch' type of game. However, after a few business rejections it was completed anyway -- placeholder graphics and all. The game was first released in December 2020, but was changed to free in Q1 of 2022. Features: No jump scares. Not one is in the game. If jump scares in horror games irk you, then check this game out. No inventory to deal with. Your flashlight has infinite battery life. Loot is automatically handled. Very clean and simple UI. No combat. Your only options are Avoidance and Evasion. Perma-death. Data is recorded at the end of a completed game, but there is no saving and returning. Power-ups that can quickly turn enemy encounters in your favor. 25 Steam Achievements available. Quick Tips: Press the Escape key to view the mini-map (and a red compass). It reveals everything except enemy locations and 'Voices of the Doomed' areas. The Lore category in the Main Menu has additional game play hints that aren't found in the Tutorial. You can see the Shadow cat if you have the Super Flashlight power-up. Stage Key location hints: On stage 1 (Forest), the Stage Key is either west or east. On stage 2 (Study), the Stage Key is never in the 'tail' section. On stage 6 (Cultist Rooms), the Stage Key is never in the southeast room.",
