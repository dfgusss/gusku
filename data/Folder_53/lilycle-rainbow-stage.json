    "About the game": "Characters ... and many more! Features Lilycle has a sweet, heartwarming story bursting with content, with cheerful and highly-detailed illustrations by Sakura Miwabe, and featuring a sophisticated visual novel system viewed from the standpoint of one character at a time. As every character’s perspective is shown, you could say that they’re all the protagonist! All story episodes are selected from the main menu, which is arranged like a calendar, with different ones view-able on different days. Once specific episodes are completed, new ones will become available, allowing the player (that’s you!) to experience the intricacies of Lilycle’s story-line.

Tamaki wishes with all her might that she could keep watching over Yuno, who’s always been number one in her heart... but the circumstances around her are changing, little by little. It's not only one girl she has to keep watch over now, after all. Saeka has always been dependable and supportive, and Tamaki has begun to feel confused... “Sigh... Looks like she always needs someone by her side too...” Saeka still has a crush on Yuno, but has been enraptured by Tamaki's aura, and finds that she can’t leave her alone. Recently, she's been mulling over whether or not she wants to try and change the way she is... As they chat, grow closer, become jealous, get embarrassed, and laugh... The crisscrossing emotions of these three girls allow this warm yet slightly bitter story to unfold...",
