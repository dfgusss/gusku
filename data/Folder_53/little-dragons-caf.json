    "About the game": "Little Dragons Café opens with a twin brother and sister learning to cook and manage a small café with their mother. All was routine until one morning when the twins discover that their mother won’t wake up. Suddenly, a strange old man appears and tells them that they must raise a dragon to save her. Working with three quirky café employees, the twins must wrangle a dragon and run the family business while finding a way to save their mother. In Little Dragons Café, players can choose to play as either sibling Ren or Rin. The story-driven gameplay features a balance of three elements: Manage your café - Run your own café by preparing tasty dishes, serving your customers, and managing a colorful cast of eccentric staff and visitors. Explore the world - Discover an entirely new world filled with wildlife, secrets, and dangers while collecting ingredients and recipes to enhance your café menu. Raise a Dragon - Care for and train your very own dragon as he grows from baby to adult. Explore, hunt, and uncover new areas with your faithful companion.",
