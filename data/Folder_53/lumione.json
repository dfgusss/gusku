    "About the game": "About the Game: Lumione is an ocean themed side-scrolling platformer game. The game’s major themes are chasing dreams and having hope. You will play the part of the beloved deep-sea fairy, Glimmer, as you escape from darkness and follow the path of the Light. The Light will guide you to your hopes and dreams as you learn about the world and your place within it. Faced with trials of wisdom and courage, you will need to prove you’ve got what it takes to bring the light of hope back to the darkness of the seabed. A Breathtaking Journey Through the Ocean Powered by UE4, the game employs a unique process that combines concept art and 3D modelling to produce vivid and dynamic graphics. With the addition of original music and sound effects, the game will come to life before you as you traverse the deep-sea universe. 'Agonizing' Side-Scrolling Platformer The gameplay is simple, yet satisfyingly difficult. You will control our hero Glimmer as you head for the end of each level by jumping, climbing, and gliding—all while evading deadly traps and obstacles. The challenges ahead are not for the faint-hearted, but as you progress through the game and develop precision in your fingers, you will surely be thrilled by the joy of accomplishment. Tip: When gliding, you can freely move in any direction for a short duration. However, this skill can only be used once before needing to be recharged. To recharge, land on a surface or trigger certain game mechanics. 170 Levels and over 10 Game Mechanics The full version of the game features as many as 170 levels, each designed with an extensive set of challenges involving unique gameplay. There are over 10 unique game mechanics, including 'neon beam', 'pinball', and many more. Centered around the core gameplay of 'traversing the landscape', these mechanics must be either avoided or taken advantage of in order to beat the level and progress through the game. ---------------------------------- Developer's Comment: Hello everyone! I am Raker, the producer of Lumione. Our humble team is made up of four enthusiastic gamers, all of whom have just graduated from university. Lumione is our first game, and it has proven to be a true labor of love. We hope you love this game as much as we loved making it. At its heart, Lumione is a story about overcoming difficulties while finding light in your life. Like any worthwhile endeavor, there lay difficulties in the road ahead, and failure is inevitable. But with the drive and determination to push past these distractions, you will come out the other side a stronger and more robust individual. This is the attitude I try to carry with me in my everyday life, and this is the attitude I wish to convey to you all through our game. We hope you enjoy Lumione, and we hope it brings some meaning to your life. ---------------------------------- We will host special events and give out prizes in our official social media channels.
