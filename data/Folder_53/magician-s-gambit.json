    "About the game": "Magician's Gambit is a virtual reality makeover of Chess, a game that has captivated players for centuries. Experience one of the world's favorite games of strategy in a beautifully rendered fantasy world where magic is the norm, wielded with just a flick of the wrist. You won't find any stylised icon interfaces here - this is the way chess against an AI is meant to be played. Even though it is still in Early Access, this is an exquisitely polished single player game. A full release is planned for the inclusion of multi-player gaming. Featuring numerous levels of difficulty, this game will pose a challenge for players of all abilities, from beginners to grandmasters. With graphics rendered in Unreal Engine 4 and AI powered by the Stockfish Chess Engine, Magician's Gambit provides plenty of eye candy for casual gamers whilst still providing a real challenge for serious chess players.",
