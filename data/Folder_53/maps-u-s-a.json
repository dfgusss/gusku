    "About the game": "Maps: U.S.A. is an educational game designed to teach the name, location, and capital of all fifty states of the United States of America. Various difficulty settings and hints can be adjusted to accommodate those just learning, as well as those who already know the lay of the land. At game's end the player will either be rewarded with a fireworks display and rousing anthem, or an invitation to play again until they can correctly identify all 50 states without a single misstep. An entertaining soundtrack keeps the mood light and the pressure low. God bless the USA!",
