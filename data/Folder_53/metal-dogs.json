Weapons can be freely assigned to 3 slots, so it is possible to customize your load-out according to your play style, such as 'attack power specialized type equipped with cannons in all slots'. Changing Dungeons The terrain and treasure chests change each time you play the dungeon. Therefore, even if you play the same map many times, you can have a different experience each time.
