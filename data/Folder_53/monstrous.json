    "About the game": "Monstrous offers a fresh take on directional melee combat and what a game with a strong combat focus can do in greater context. If you have enjoyed the fighting pace of Dark Souls, the dueling gameplay of Jedi Academy, the world building of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver &amp; Vampire: the Masquerade Bloodlines or have fond memories of looting your friends' graves in Moonstone: A Hard Day's Knight we would like to invite you to join us on our journey to breathe new life into the 'rivals on a quest' formula in a new, dark fantasy world undergoing industrial revolution. SKILL BASED, ROBUST MELEE COMBAT We are bringing competitive fighting game mechanics to the 3rd person action adventure genre. Dodge incoming attacks and aim your blows in skill based melee combat without target locks. Apply pressure to guard crush opponents, employ zoning tactics, block and counter attack enemies to turn the tables and punish turtling foes with grabs. We have built a solid backbone to make a respectable fighting experience accessible and playable in the 3rd person action format. DIVERSE CAST OF PLAYABLE MONSTERS Classic Gothic horror characters and villains are presented in a dark graphic novel art style. Player characters with signature fighting styles, powers &amp; skills bring their own approaches and solutions to gameplay scenarios. SESSION BASED, 'ONE MORE GAME' FORMAT Take on the dangers and secrets of the city in adaptable, short and long play sessions. You can also invite Steam friends to take over other monsters in play for a game night with your buddies, or join other players on the Steam network via quickplay if you prefer a multiplayer experience. THE CITY IS YOUR PLAYGROUND Prowl on rooftops to ambush foes, discover items and collect lore bits. Complete shared quests, defeat random encounters and compete for power as you get closer to the final showdown in the ancient heart of the city.",
