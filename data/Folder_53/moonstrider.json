    "About the game": "Moonstrider is an action-packed space rogue-like where you sail through space with rocket boots, fight deadly and cunning aliens, and explore the galaxy. Each playthrough features uniquely generated solar systems to ensure that no two games are ever the same. Chart your flight path from planet to planet to minimize danger, or dive headlong against formidable foes for greater rewards. Fortunately, you're not alone in your attempts to survive: merchants, refugees, and other explorers are all out in space to help you survive - for a price. As you explore the universe, you'll find your crew, uncover ancient secrets, and if you're really really lucky, make it back to Earth alive. Key Features Randomly Generated Solar Systems - With dozens of enemies, items, planet types, and even suns, no two games will ever be the same. Explore the Galaxy - Jump from planet to planet with your trusty rocket boots to find valuable resources, useful items, and mysterious warp gates. Discover Weird Secrets - Eyeball-studded planets, crashed satellites, mysterious monoliths, and adorable snowaliens are all out there waiting to be found. Loads of Items - In true rogue-like fashion, upgrade your abilities with powerful items from the various alien races. Find optical arrays, hypnosis shards, gravity wallets, and many, many more! Dozens of Strange Aliens - Crystal pirates, acid-spewing moths, sentry drones, hammer-wielding miners, and more lurk in space, ready to battle. Fight Epic Bosses - Be it the massive Annihilator Probe with its endless supply of missiles or the artillery-wielding Incinerator and its fiery drones, a brutal challenge awaits at the end of each solar system! Unique Characters - From the adventurous commander to the explosive engineer, every member of the spaceship's crew is playable, each with unique weapons and abilities.",
