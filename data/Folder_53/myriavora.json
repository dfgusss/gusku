    "About the game": "A million years in the future. Evolutionary pressure has turned spiders into a far superior species. Humans are now close to extinction. The last survivors rely on remains of powerful technology they didn't invent and barely understand. You traverse this lonely, hostile world in search for a safe home. Key features Vicious enemy swarm AI Shoot to shoot faster : each shot temporarily boosts your rate of fire Agility based combat : run, slide, jump, dash, and glide to prevail Roguelike with meta progression : you lose all progress when you die, but you get to keep your gear Fight on 68 maps with individual defense units Pick your loadout from 20 powerful skills Assemble your outfit from 58 customizable pieces of clothing Customize your character with 14 hair styles and 22 facial options Input method: mouse &amp; keyboard (rebindable) Potential issues Realistically animated spiders : If you're arachnophobic, skip this game. Violence : Spiders die graphically. No visual injuries to human characters. Nudity : You can undress your character. Anatomic accuracy can be adjusted. No sexual content. NO intentional jump scares (but it's an action game—be careful if you're sensitive) Gameplay NOT dependent on color vision (to my knowledge—let me know if I missed something)",
