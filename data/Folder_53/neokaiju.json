    "About the game": "NEOKAIJU is a game all about causing destruction and gaining power as fast as you can. You control a small kaiju, trapped in a lab and used as a power source for the nearby city — break out, and go break buildings. When you save your friends, you grow in size until you’re absolutely monstrous. Your abilities, a dash attack and a laser beam, become more powerful as you level up as well! Maneuver the city by climbing walls and smashing through windows, avoiding the deadly swarm drones that will try to stop you.",
