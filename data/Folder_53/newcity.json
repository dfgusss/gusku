    "About the game": "NewCity from Lone Pine Games is a city builder that celebrates the simulation titles of yesteryear with classic gameplay and a fresh coat of paint. Build Your City •You’re the Mayor; you lead your city with impunity. There are no councilmembers here—every decision, every victory, every setback…it all comes down to you. Build from the ground up, from a rural town to metropolitan jewel, and call every shot along the way. Learn Their Names •Track individual people and businesses. Peek into the lives of your citizens and follow them through their daily routines. See where they work, play, and sleep. Big Brother Mayor is watching. And hopefully, you’re benevolent. Plan For Traffic •Upgrade roads and plan highway networks. Carefully place your city’s roads to create the circulatory system that keeps it humming. Make sure to leave room for upgrades once your citizens outgrow the humble two-lane road… Parks, Museums, and Schools •Create a livable city for that sweet, sweet tax revenue. Add all the amenities to keep your citizens happy. Word of mouth gets around, and you’ll find your population booming in short order. More citizens mean more money and often more problems in turn. Balance the Budget •From careful planning to emergency fixes , there is no Finance Director to delegate. Manage well to keep your city in the black. Sustainable growth is the key. Don’t overextend yourself; the economy can be a fickle beast! Get the Skyscraper •Cultivate a towering city center and win world renown. The badge of honor for cities across the globe are towers of steel and glass that reach forth to touch the sky itself. Do your job right, and the skyscraper is yours—along with the renown and prestige it brings. Design a Unique City •The building designer tool allows for endless creativity. Set your creativity loose and build the city of your dreams, or recreate the city you live in. The choice is yours. You have every tool at your disposal, mayor. The only limit is your imagination. Perils Straight From the Headlines •The only disasters are the ones we make. Tired of UFOs attacking your city? So are we. This isn’t that kind of city builder. Here, the disasters are of our own design. Do you have what it takes to keep your city thriving through an economic recession? Take a Line of Credit from the bank and get to work. But remember—you’ll have to pay it back eventually…",
