    "About the game": "Can you survive the horrors of the Complex? First released in 2009, One Night is a survival horror game that combines the gameplay of Playstation-era classics such as Resident Evil and Parasite Eve with a 16-bit aesthetic inspired by modern indie games. At long last, this RPG Maker classic comes to Steam as One Night: Ultimate Edition , updated with a brand new engine, overhauled gameplay mechanics and a completely rewritten storyline. Set in an alternate version of the year 2012, One Night challenges you to escape from a top-secret research facility known only as 'The Complex', a place fallen to forces that defy explanation. Everybody you knew is dead, and something has gone terribly wrong. Now relentless monsters and fiendish puzzles await you around every corner as you attempt to make your escape from a literal Hell on Earth. Traditional survival horror gameplay in the style of 90s classics. Terrifying story that blends science fiction with H.P Lovecraft. Multiple endings and NPCs that live or die based on your actions. Updated for modern configurations and operating systems. Completely free to play!",
