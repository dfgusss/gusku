In a Japan filled with spirits and monsters, ages ago, the land itself was rocked by chaos. From the depths rose the terrible Kamigui who carved a path of destruction through all. The gods and people struggled for a century. At last, Amaterasu Oomikami, goddess of the Sun, placed three great Seals forcing the Kamigui away and returning peace once again. Time has passed, and now, one of the great Seals has shattered. A dark force arises once more. On the far western island of Onigashima, fate brings together a young woman and a child of the Oni. The journey of destiny begins now!",
