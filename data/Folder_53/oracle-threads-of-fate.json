About Us Oracle is a student game built in 5 months for a business venture graduate class. While the class only needed a business proposal, our small team wanted the experience of bringing a game to market release. For many of us, this game is the first one we have truly completed. It is a point of pride and a stepping stone for the many games we hope will follow.",
