    "About the game": "A simple point &amp; shoot adventure game. Organosphere features a 4 square kilometer re-creation of Johannesburg, South Africa. The map itself is open and can be explored as you please but the actual game objectives are linear and simple enough to casually finish the game story in a few hours. The story itself is a Sci-Fi tale which reveals the mysterious true purpose of the earth - the greatest super computer ever built. The game itself asks questions about how things such as the eco system may parallel a computing program, what does it all mean, and why is brakpan? The gameplay features simple shooting and inventory management, with a standard possible load out of 7 weapons, including the bizzare yet useful Flame-Saw[Flamethrower chainsaw] and Bass Cannon. If you are from Johannesburg, then you might enjoy the familiar surrounding and noticeable landmarks. If not, you may enjoy the simple old school shooter gameplay, or if not still - please remember I am ALWAYS open to feedback and criticism, and if you simply ask me for a feature to be implemented there is an extremely good chance we will oblige. We believe in open communication between developers and the players, so please get in touch. Gameplay hints: 1. Save often with F5/Quicksave 2. Access inventory with Tab (or assign a custom control) to use health items 3. Find Ammo in wooden crates or on fallen enemies",
