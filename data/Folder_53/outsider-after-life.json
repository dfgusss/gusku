    "About the game": "Humanity disappeared centuries ago. The Escape Initiative — our last-ditch chance to survive — has failed. But among the ruins of a mysterious science complex an accident restores power to a unique android who might be the only one who can save the universe. Journey with HUD-ini through an emotional story full of awe and wonder, shot in one continuous camera. Unravel the mysteries of Outsider: After Life through solving a variety of logic-based puzzles set in an immersive world brought to life with beautiful visuals and a captivating soundtrack. Features: Story-Focused Puzzles Every puzzle is embedded into the captivating sci-fi narrative of Outsider: After Life. From restoring HUD-ini to exploring a now barren Earth, solving each puzzle will progress the story. The End of Humanity Never Looked so Good From the adorable HUD-ini to the sweeping vistas of an alien planet, Outsider: After Life visuals pop with striking colours and beautiful hand-animated set-pieces. It Just Makes Sense Gone are the days of using a rubber chicken as a zip-line. Every puzzle you’ll come across on your galactic journey can be solved with some mind-bending but fair logic. Interstellar Adventures Need a Soundtrack A sci-fi adventure needs a ‘stellar’ soundtrack, and Outsider: After Life is no different. The dark and atmospheric tones sweep in to really drive home some key story beats.
