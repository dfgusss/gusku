    "About the game": "Party Poppers follows in the footsteps of Party Golf and Party Crashers but with the brand new adorable Poppers in addition to the same incredible customisation options and crazy competitive couch gameplay you know and love. There's a game mode for everyone in this fast paced platformer that is sure to bring a party to wherever you play! Initially the game is a simple competitive platformer that places you in control of the adorable popper characters with a single jump and a grapple hook, and your aim is to pop as many balloons as you can! Yet Party Poppers truly shines when you see how powerful the customisation is, why not add double jump? Moon gravity? Infinite length grapples? All of the above? You make the game you want to play!",
