    "About the game": "Path Out is is an autobiographical adventure game that allows the players to experience the journey of Abdullah Karam, a young Syrian artist that escaped the civil war in 2014. Path Out is a tale full of surprises, challenges and paradoxical humor, giving insight in this real-life adventure, on which Abdullah comments through Youtube-style videos in the game. Features: Autobiographical adventure based on real events Relive Abdullah's escape from war-torn Syria Abdullah shares his thoughts in key game point with Youtube-style commentary videos Neo-orchestral electronica music with oriental influences by Wobblersound Meticulously researched pixel art style inspired by classic 16-bit games and Syrian art A unique non-combat &amp; narrative driven experience In this first part of Abdullah's journey, he recalls life before the war, a family decision that led to his departure and the perilous journey from his hometown Hama to the Turkish border through the war-torn Aleppo province. The players follow Abdullah's path, getting to know his life, family and surrounding in a narrative adventure that also contains quests and challenges that are based on real events. The gameplay closely follows narrative classics like To The Moon, adding the bitter flavor of the Syrian war, the violence by soldiers and rebels that the players have to escape and the murderous minefield that have to be navigated during the escape. “I used to be an average kid - going to school, listening to music, and playing video games... Lots of video games” , says Abdulla, Writer and Graphic Designer of Path Out. “When my home turned into a war zone and during my escape I suddenly had to deal with very different circumstances... like spotting landmines or surviving a river ride in an oil barrel while crossing a border. I’m looking forward to be able to share the beginning of my story in Path Out with players around the world”. Does the story end here? Currently Path Out only tells the beginning of Abdullah’s escape. Upcoming episodes of Path Out could take players on a journey from Syria through Turkey, Greece and the Balkan until he finally arrives at his destination (and current whereabouts) in Central Europe. Who made Path Out? Path Out is a collaboration between Abdullah Karam, the developers of Causa Creations, Wobblersound and the Austrian-American graphic designer Brian Maine.",
