    "About the game": "INTRODUCTION You've been called out in the middle of the night to fix an emergency generator. What you don't bet on is being kidnapped by a cocky madman who forces you to complete his challenges. POWERTRIP is a short, dark and sometimes funny 3D Platformer where the most casual kidnapper on the planet berates you. STORY Being called out in the middle of the night isn't exactly usual for you but it's all part of the job. You get to the place in question and you realize you've forgotten some tool or other. That's the least of your problems tonight. Acid, Insults, Rickety Elevators, Ringing Ears and more are just a few of the things POWERTRIP has in store for you. Plus, your cocky yet extremely casual kidnapper doesn't much care for you. Shame. GAMEPLAY Gameplay consists of jumping piitfalls filled with acid, timing your moves to music, hurtful comments and more.",
