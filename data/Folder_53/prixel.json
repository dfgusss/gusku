    "About the game": "Prixel is an old-school pixel style 2d platformer. It's designed with speed-running in mind, but everyone can enjoy it. Complete the level as fast as possible and you will get a reward. Every level has at least one hidden route for the best time. To find them all is a challenge on it's own. Enemies found in dungeons will try to impede your way and kill you with a single strike. Be careful!",
