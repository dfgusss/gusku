    "About the game": "PropHunter - a fresh representative of the genre of hide and seek on the net! The players are divided into two teams - one team is hiding by taking the form and properties of objects, the second team is seek to find for impostors among props. Hide rather! To win, you need to hide, and the best disguise is in plain sight of the enemy! Take over the appearance and properties of the selected object and do not draw attention to yourself! Or vice versa, make some noise to attract hunters! Catch the impostor! To win, the hunters need to find all the props-players! Each imposter caught goes to the hunter team. When the allotted round time expires, hunters automatically lose if at least one prop-player is still alive. Defend yourself! Not only are hunters dangerous, props are too! They can damage the hunter if they hit him with great force! Each hunter eliminated goes to the props team. Use skills! To make the gameplay more interesting, the team of hunters and props have their own unique abilities. Use your intuition, become invisible, reincarnate into an object or throw a bomb at a group of props, speed up or replenish your health! Each ability can be used only after the player picks up the corresponding card on the level! They are located everywhere and appear randomly. Have fun! Invite your friends and play with them! Have fun, look for each other, compete! Trading Cards! Features of the game Play as hunters or props, use unique abilities to gain advantage! Play on open servers, or invite friends to a private server! Deceive the hunters, mock them! Or find and eliminate props! Friendship will win anyway!",
