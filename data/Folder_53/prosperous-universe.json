    "About the game": "THE SPACE ECONOMY MMO In Prosperous Universe, you are the CEO of your own spacefaring company. Explore the galaxy, design spaceships, forge alliances, and most importantly: produce, trade, transport, and profit. Manage your business through a highly customizable user interface named APEX. Start your company at a slow pace as you accumulate wealth over real-time hours, and watch as all your hard work comes to fruition. Real Economics. Real Ramifications Contribute to a purely player-driven MMO economy in a persistent universe allowing for unique experiences, a multitude of play styles, and no grind to speak of. With its emphasis on realism in everything from the economy to space travel, Prosperous Universe provides a unique experience to players of all backgrounds. COLONIZATION From civilization building to workforce behavior, reality has guided the design for this space MMO. There are a wealth of factors to consider when deciding where to build your first base such as: atmosphere, minerals, temperature, pressure, access to water, and terrain. Understanding and exploiting complex systems are key to surviving in the vastness of the universe. Will you set up shop near the local commodity exchange or venture out to remote parts of the universe for more resources? The choice is yours. PRODUCTION No grind required: The success of your simulated business is not limited by the amount of time you input. Set your own goals and forge your own destiny in the deepest reaches of space. Every resource and commodity can and must be produced by a real player. Choose your profession wisely. Certain materials are easy to produce but won’t make you rich, while others are scarce but require careful planning. Stumble upon a goldmine-like supply chain and watch your profits skyrocket. TRADING Every price is determined by supply and demand in a real-time market exchange that operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This online space simulator provides an economy in which all players compete and cooperate with one another. Trade or bid on commodities, in-game currencies, and information with a vivid operational interface hub. Bringing wealth to your base will increase your workforce population, and over time your space colony will transform into economic force to be reckoned with. SHIPPING Transport cargo, design spaceships, or explore remote planets as you so desire. Spaceships provide players with a multitude of strategies. Will you establish multiple bases across the galaxy, ferrying materials to and from each location? Or maybe you would rather fulfil shipment contracts where you deliver resources to other players, for a price of course. Keep an eye on your fuel gauge, you don’t want to be caught on the intergalactic highway on empty. POLITICS Become the Governor of your planet and rule with an iron fist or a benevolent heart. Many planets are home to several political factions. These factions have their own interests and political agendas that may run in opposition to your personal or collective goals. Choose to join them or work against them. With enough leverage, you’re sure to be able to convince even the most powerful of politicians.",
