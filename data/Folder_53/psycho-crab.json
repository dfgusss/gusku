    "About the game": "A 2D physics platformer with an unusual control scheme, Psycho Crab is a game where you will fall down. A lot. Possibly into lava. While maybe being chased by seagulls. Play as a crab on a journey to eat a brick of sushi, climbing over (and under, and around) whatever stands in your way! Featuring 10 different crabs (the starting one, eight unlockable, and a reskin) and one really long level (+ a shorter challenge level), this game can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple dozen to beat one crab or dozens to over a hundred to beat them all. Spin the crab's legs around and grab onto objects, and try not to fall down!",
