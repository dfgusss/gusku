    "About the game": "The world is under siege by an alien armada. - Fight the aliens back and destroy the master alien ship. To get there you must close the 5 Gates. We know you have saved the world a lot of times, that is why we need you as a pilot to do it again. - Join now! Pterodalien is the next Shoot 'em Up which takes another step forward in the evolution of the shmup-genre. As the story is made for players who act up to the principle 'first shoot - ask questions later' the sophisticated gameplay-cycle gives the succesfull player the opportunity to stand out from the other players to get all the 48 achievements . Now as the mission is clear the player will be equiped with high-tech space ship that can be upgraded . The player is able to earn upgrade points (attributes) after a Level-UP in the experience-system . The player can choose between different upgrades: main-gun, lasergun, homing-missle, Rocket, Speed, Health. - But decisions should be chosen wisely because some upgrades have a trade-off ... So for example a homing-missile makes an easy hit but only a hit with the main-gun brings aditionally XP for you next Level-Up. In the tradition of Shmups, Pterodalien has it's own combo-system : with each alien ship you shoot you will get a card from the type of alienship you have shot, you can get an XP-Bonus for 3-of-a-type 4-of-a-type and 5-of-a-type, also another XP-Bonus for a 3+2 combo . But it is not that easy, the player starts with the chance for a 3-of-type, once this is reached the chance counter raises to 4 . Then the player is able to reach a 4-of-a-type and so on. In case the player is not succesfull the counter is reset to 3 . - So the succesfull player will first aim and then shoot. After making achievements the player will get aditionally rank-points with reaching certain amounts the player will be promoted and reach a higher rank. Pterodalien comes with 11 stunning sci-fi levels each of them has boss-fights Many Alien Bosses have a character and are giving comments during the bossfight The game has a lot of different types of enemy spacecrafts and turrets to shoot",
