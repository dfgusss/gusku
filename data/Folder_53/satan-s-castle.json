    "About the game": "This game is an action &amp; strategy. While attacking you can summon monsters at the same time and fight. MP is required to summon monsters. Let's defeat all enemies while paying attention so that the Satan's HP will not be 0. Be careful not to break the three crystals in the defense game. You can strengthen monsters at points you get from your enemies. As you advance the stage, more monsters can be summoned. You can play the stage once cleared any number of times. Operation is done with the keyboard or Xbox 360 controller. You can save on the menu screen by pressing Enter (Start).",
