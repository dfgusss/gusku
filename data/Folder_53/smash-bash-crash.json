    "About the game": "Over the top vehicle combat is back with a fresh update with beautiful new graphics, ridiculous new weapons, portals, pickups and introducing the ability to play online with friends. After five years of the community not asking for it, we’ve finally released update 3 of Smash Bash Crash. Challenge friends, or AI, to arena-based vehicle combat across a range of maps using your vehicle of choice. Matches include up to four players and the last one standing takes all glory. Supports local co-op or online play using Remote Play Together. A classic game with surprisingly complex yet funny strategies and a lot of laughs. Now you can challenge up to 4 of your friends online using Steam’s Remote Play Together feature, your friends don’t even need to own the game! We thought of every crazy weapon idea we could and crammed them all in. Now you can enjoy your mayhem as it was meant to be.The update includes improvements to all of the classic weapons with bigger bangs and more of them. Use the Portals for a quick escape from chasing enemies or to quickly transport to a different area of the map. Pickups are where its at! Each arena contains several Pickup points which random spawn excessively powerful weaponry. Use these to cause maximum damage to opponents. Choose from five cars and battle on one of the 13 arenas including a new night-time version of Real. We’ve repainted all of the cars and added plenty of new paintjobs ready to be wrecked. Optimisation This comprehensive update also includes a bunch of code rewrites and engine optimisations that you’ll never even notice but their there so that’s got to be worth something.",
