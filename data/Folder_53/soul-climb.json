    "About the game": "Easy to learn, hard to master. Overcome your limits in this tight precision platformer with quick respawns. Jump from walls, avoid deadly traps and time your movements perfectly so you can climb out of the deep cave you fell into. It’s all about not giving up! You can’t really answer how you got here. You’re very deep in this cave and can’t find anyone else. All that’s left is to face the challenge alone. It seems like the cave doesn't want you to leave. It tries to hold you, and everything hurts, making you return to the beginning. But you must keep trying. Every failure is a lesson. After each fall, you rise up better. Even if the challenge seems too harsh, you can do it. After all, you are never really alone. Features: Over 50 levels Quick respawn Precise movement Full controller support Assist mode Play it fullscreen or windowed!",
