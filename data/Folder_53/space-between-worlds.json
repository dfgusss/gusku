    "About the game": "A minimalistic, abstract game about physical and emotional distance between people. Space Between Worlds is a Free To Play game with simple and intuitive controls and a puzzle gameplay based on the concept of proxemics, where the physical distance between people represents their emotional one (and holds the key to solve the levels). The game was made during the Internet Festival Game Jam of Pisa in 40 hours, and won the first prize. The game presents itself with a minimalistic look and an abstract story: you will have to interpret what you are seeing to guide your square avatar through the difficulties of life. We created Space Between Worlds to attempt to tell a story in a different way and communicate emotions through interaction and play. We brought it here on Steam, to let a whole new audience to experience this peculiar game. Features Peculiar puzzles based on player interpretation of the level. A story told through gameplay. Music from Brian Crain. Lots of squares and touching moments.",
