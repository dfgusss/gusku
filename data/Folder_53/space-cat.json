You can customize the game’s difficulty by toggling individual hazards, and your character's movement options. There is also a side-scrolling story-based Adventure Mode, a multiplayer Battle Mode, a time trial-based Boss Rush mode, and multiplayer Minigames. In all of these modes, you can collect special coins to unlock hats for your cat to wear.",
