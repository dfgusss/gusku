    "About the game": "Square Journey is a minimalist action game. The time has come for Square to know more about himself, his conscience begs for meaning in his life. He needs to go through the dungeons of his inner castle, overcoming the obstacles that are presented to him at each level. Dodge stakes, shots, flames, saws, stone balls and electrical discharges using fast reflexes, attention, rhythm and patience , but if you can't, don't worry, in this game death it's not the end , it just means that you've become more experienced to win the proposed challenge. Throughout the stages, as Square matures, he gains the ability to become invulnerable for a short period of time, and in the more difficult stages, his Self sends him a usable item that allows Square to slow down time , use it wisely! Before each level, Square has a little dialogue with his Self/Divine Consciousness, it's an invitation for reflection . Breathe, think about what is said, don't take it as truth, don't follow it as a belief, but reflect, it can bring you a little inner peace and maybe instigate you to seek self-knowledge. There are 12 hand-crafted challenges to overcome Choose from 5 soundtracks that you like the most when playing, If you want to laugh a little, pick Mouth Music Try out the game, have fun, and I really hope that Square Journey can inspire you to think more about yourself and about life.",
