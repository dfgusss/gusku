    "About the game": "If you need somewhere to vent your need of destruction, this is for you. Get satisfied when smashing, splitting, melting your enemies or anything else you see in the environment. As we believe this this is the core gameplay satisfaction, we really focused our effort to make it right. Layering on top of that, to avoid repetition we give you control of both land and sea vehicles or even a Mecha with varieties of weapons, some of which are ridiculous but satisfying to use such as a giant hammer to squash enemy tanks. We also don't want a shallow gun-blazing gameplay so we carefully designed the enemies to avoid that as well as adding upgrade tree and drivers-vehicle combination system which allow creating different classes. You can play solo/co-op in the main campaign or battling each other in PvP arenas. The world has a balanced mix of platforming, shooting and Metroidvania adventure. You will need to navigate tricky terrains, avoid being tricked by some smart imposter, dodge enemy ramming tanks, run away from hordes of suicide bombers, avoid being squashed by falling rocks or helping your friendly army win a battle. There is also a solo survival mode where you compete for top spots in the world leaderboard. Key features: Up to 4 players online, shared screen, split screen co-op campaign. Fun focused Player versus Player battles with ability to team up locally on one machine to battle online Metroidvania style adventure.
