It includes three sophisticated minigames where you can show your friends or who is the boss here! Play as one of the oblique forty sons of King Placebo IV against your brothers, to prove yourself worthy to become his successor and to rule the kingdom of Placeboland. Gold Digger In the minigame Gold Digger you have to dig up pieces of gold and bring them home safely. Excavation is too exhausting for you? No problem: simply ambush your opponents or sneak unnoticed into their homes to rob them. Take everything of your opponents without respect and increase your wealth. Pearl Diver In the minigame Pearl Diver you dive for pearls. Take these out of the water to get points. But be careful, because you have limited breathing air available and your unscrupulous opponents will try to pull you under the water until you run out of air. Collect scuba tanks and flippers to give you an advantage and keep your opponent under the water. Steel Beam In the minigame Steel Beam, players must avoid getting hit by a steel beam turning faster and faster. Jump over or hit the steel beam, so you will not be hit with full force and break all your bones. key features Three crazy minigames for the whole family Play with up to four friends or against the A.I.​ alone Full controller support. One of the players can also easily play with keyboard Customizable characters",
