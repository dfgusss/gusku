    "About the game": "Our dungeon crawler Δ Time (Delta Time) is a third person game which takes place in space, with atmospheric colors and glowing effects in a lit artsy pixelated style which uses interesting gameplay mechanics. Time moves only when you move, so take your time and fight in style! The only way to get into the next room is by killing your enemies. You can charge your attack (3x) to make more damage. Your health is not gonna regenerate! Once you die you will get back to the start of the game. Beat the Highscore. Rooms and enemies are endless. You play as a naked dude in space encircled by a bunch of evil aliens. Sounds like a lot of fun, don’t you think? P.S. Beware of the moving wall 😜 Please use a xbox controller 🎮 Δ Time is the final bachelor project created by students of Salzburg University of Applied Sciences (👽👽👽MMA + 👽MMT)",
