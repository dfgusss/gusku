    "About the game": "One of a series of planned Escape rooms in different, unique, locations and situations. The game focuses on Observation, listening, logic, cunning, and physical puzzles. Keeping you immersed, the puzzles logically fit with the situation, and don’t force a mini game where it would not belong. This is a very difficult Escape room. Do not set your difficulty on Level 5 unless you are SUPER SMART. Story You have interfered with the plans of a rival who has left you to die on a plane, along with some expendable cargo. The pilots are gone, and the plane is flying itself. How long the plane will last in the air, is a guess. Best to get out, as quickly as possible. Key Features Hint system and menu controls are fit into the location, so you never have to exit, to make changes. Hints are based on progress, so you’ll never get a hint that is not relevant. The game is part non linear, so you can chose how you progress. If one puzzle is giving you a problem, spend time on another for a while. It’s VR, designed for full room-scale/standing tracking with motion controllers. Can play seated, but you would still need to reach to the floor to pick things up. Switchable movement controls. Adjustable height Controls. Adjustable difficulty levels. Level 5 is for Super Escape Genius-Level Brains. Do not attempt. Level 3 is the standard level. Level 0 is more casual, or for people who are new to escape rooms. The Game has been played on Valve Index, HTC Vive, and Quest 2 (including Virtual Desktop) Playtime can be 1.5-3 hours depending on difficulty, and skill. There is only a 30% completion rate with L5. Choose L0-L3 if you are easily distracted, or streaming. This game was originally designed as an escape challenge, then toned down for retail.",
