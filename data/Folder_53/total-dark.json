    "About the game": "During many years Ristam village was protected from the evils by a protective sphere. The sphere was so attractive that everyone wanted to own it, and one day the relic was stolen. This led to a chain of irreversible consequences that opened a portal to hell. And only you, the white mage, can save the village by destroying all the portal's power sources and bring peace back to the village. 'Total Dark' is a classic arkanoid. You need to hit a ball with a platform, accurately directing it to the area covered by various plates. By a targeted hit the plates disappear or become thinner to disappear from the second / third hit. The goal of the game is to completely clear the closed field and not lose the flying ball.",
