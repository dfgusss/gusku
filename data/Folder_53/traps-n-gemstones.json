    "About the game": "A 'Metroidvania'-style platform adventure, with inspiration going all the way back to SNES and 8-bit classics. Traps n' Gemstones is a modern take on exploration-based, backtracking platformers, loaded with hidden chambers to uncover, artifacts to find, weapons to use and items to combine. THE PLOT Precious relics have suddenly started to disappear from a well-hid pyramid that has been guarded by Bedouins for generations, who claim to have spotted an unknown perpetrator. As a freelance archaeologist and expert on ancient explorations, you've been secretly called in to Egypt to help them solve the mystery. Arriving at the pyramid's entrance empty handed, your journey starts off by searching some well-known chambers for items and weapons to help you on your quest. But as you get deeper into the pyramid, you begin to realize that this mystery will require more than just a whip, a sharp mind and a good amount of explosives to unravel. CONTROLS Use a USB-joystick, or the following default KEYS: RUN - Cursor Left / Right JUMP - Cursor Up or ALT ROLL - Cursor Down or CTRL WHIP - Space bar MAP - Return or F1 Alternatively, you can reconfigure the keys to your own liking on the OPTIONS screen.
