    "About the game": "Turbeton is a competitive multiplayer game in which two players go head-to-head, waging a strategic fight for control of the Afterlife. Each player drafts a lineup of five Leaders who duke it out to kill the opponent's Shrines. Whoever destroys both of their opponent's Shrines first -- wins! Each Leader has a unique set of abilities, constantly waging battle as they die and resurrect from the Afterlife. Using multiple Leaders in combination leads to horrifically broken, game-ending combos. As you fight, players earn Gold which they can use to purchase Relics, further enhancing their army. Relics lend themselves to different playstyles: whether it's going straight for the kill, playing slow and methodical, or creating absolute chaos! Features 80+ Leaders with unique playstyles Free to play! Diverse matches due to drafts at the start of the match, where players can choose Leaders from either player's deck to be included in their team 50+ Relics that add to gameplay diversity",
