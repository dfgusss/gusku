    "About the game": "Live the thrill of life and death duels that can be decided in a blink of an eye! Two Strikes is a casual 2D fighting game with beautiful hand-drawn animations, where warriors, in a Bloody Period in Japan, duel in deadly battles that can be decided in one or two hits. Focusing on what makes fighting games what they are, Two Strikes heavily relies on basic fighting game mechanics, like moving, positioning, anticipation and execution. All of that while the warriors try to avoid deadly strikes which can kill them in one or two hits. Bringing back loved characters from the first game, One Strike, and adding four more characters, the game will have a compact but quite unique set of six warriors the player can choose from. Alongside the hand-drawn characters and scenarios, the game will come with a brilliant original soundtrack.",
