    "About the game": "A simple and very promising style of play at first sight but with a difficulty that in time will give you headaches if you are not ready. - Shoot at everything you see, writing as fast and correct as possible to move to the next level. - Continue without too many breaks because here everything is in constant motion. - Destroy as many enemies as possible to be on top. As in any war, every mistake costs you, just like here, and the slightest mistake can cost you everything. 'The Keyboard Is Your Weapon! Let's just hope you can shoot without aiming. - Any mistake will affect your score. - Any mistake will increase your difficulty. - Any mistake will prevent you from being in the top. - Any mistake can be fatal to you. Everything is on levels, many levels, in levels where the difficulty is constantly increasing for your eyes and hands to work non-stop. Don't think that this is the end, but you can find your own end if you are not careful. - The number of words increases and decreases depending on the levels. - The difficulty will increase your chances of making mistakes. - The more levels you go through, the faster you have to write. Test your limits and get rewards. The more you advance, the more your results will be reflected in the top players. - Score is the total number of destroyed space ships. - The combo is the total destruction in chain. - Highscore is the limit you have to exceed. - Waves are the thresholds you have to cross.",
