    "About the game": "Hello WFDS fans, We would sincerely like to apologize for any Windows issues current players are experiencing at this time. First and foremost, we cannot thank you all enough for your love and support towards our first Indie game on Steam. Our team appreciates all the amazing feedback you provide and we will continue to address any situation as it occurs. At this point in time regarding Windows 11, we're unable to reproduce the issue. However, if anyone is using Windows 11, we do not suggest downgrading to Windows 10 as this may not fix the issue. We're working adamantly to resolve the problem and will have a solution soon. Thank you for your support. ~ Enso Entertainment Nudity can be enabled from the options menu! Waifu Fight Dango Style is an exciting new retro-type action based game incorporating a unique mix of intense gameplay and attractive, anime-style character artwork! You and your Waifu of choice will square off against an opponent by bouncing dangos between one another until you break through each other's defense! Waifu Fight is a crazy mix between the wall breaking mechanics of Breakout, the narrative and sexual elements of HuniePop, the special attacks and combos of Street Fighter, and the retro action from good old fashioned Pong! Unlike its contemporaries in the ecchi game field, Waifu Fight incorporates its characters as a gameplay element—frequently a character will pop into the middle of the screen and your dangos will bounce off of her cute and sexy body! Combine this with a robust suite of items and power-ups, the paths to victory become nearly endless! Waifu Fight Dango Style supports both single and multiplayer game modes. Each game mode is listed below with a quick description explaining its features. Story Mode: Each playable character will have their own personal story featured here. Players will be able to play through each character’s story to unlock special features, gain XP &amp; levels, and earn rewards. Each story path will be unique and predetermined. Each story will consist of the following: an introduction, 7 different character stages with character dialog before &amp; after, a boss stage with dialog before &amp; after, and an ending. Playable characters will include: Iromi, Akane, Jessica, Yume, Kasumi, Midori, Haruka, Kagami, &amp; Dr. Yuri Shimizu Amanda, Madoka, Ryoko, and Paige will eventually be playable. Potions will be usable in this mode. Arcade Mode: Traditional local multiplayer set in an arcade fashion of play Supports XBox One &amp; PS4 Controllers Potions are not allowable Challenge Mode: This mode will allow players to continue to play through an endless loop of stages. Players will be able to unlock special features, gain XP &amp; levels, earn rewards, and compete on leaderboards based upon how far they went before being defeated. Each iteration will increase the game’s difficulty substantially. Each iteration will consist of 8 random character stages and then the boss stage. After each stage is complete, players will be granted a special random bonus that will carry over to the next stage and the next stage only. After that stage is complete the process will be repeated. Potions will be usable in this mode. Casino &amp; Various Mini Games: Players will be able to gamble coins and earn more coins and/or rewards. Leaderboards apply! ** On a side note, we have included an in-game feedback feature which allows players to submit any suggestions and/or problems they might discover.",
