Explore the richly detailed world full of suspicious characters, solve mind-befuddling puzzles and track down Victorian London's most elusive serial killer - Geoff the Murderer! Inspired by classic adventure games, Hammer Horror films, cartoon network shows, Sherlock Holmes and Lovecraft it is jam-packed with Victorian mystification. Featuring - Fully voice-acted characters - Beautifully animated interactions - Over 60 locations to explore - An original soundtrack composed by Cam Reynolds inspired by 1970s B movies - A massive monster - A make your own meat friend mini-game - Even more terrible puns! The Evening Burble is calling it 'The Greatest Adventure of 1884' 'Playing Bertram Fiddle is like a watching a lost, sinister animation, but in a good way. I enjoy stumbling along and soaking up the absurdities.' Matt Elliot, PC Gamer 'plenty of riddles, tea-drinking and strangely-shaped noses,' Samuel Horti - Rock Paper Shotgun 'I wish I made games as funny as this,' Ron Giblets 'The Adventures of Bertram Fiddle: Episode 2 might just have the most amount of puns in a videogame EVER,' Baden Ronie, Wolf's Gaming Blog 'It's not as good as Donkey Island,' Guy Hardwood, aged 49",
