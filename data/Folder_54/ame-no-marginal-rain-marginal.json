    "About the game": "The latest short, serious visual novel by Tomo Kataoka, the author of Narcissu 1st &amp; 2nd, has arrived! Overview There is nothing in this world. Just endlessly falling rain. The population here is exactly one. Getting off the elevator one day, a mysterious world was waiting. No one else was around, only endless rainy sky and weathered flagstones. In this world, getting hungry and even death wasn't possible. It was a world where time seems to have stopped. Except one thing -- the rain continued to fall. 'This world has a population of just one. So get out.' A girl named 'Rin' told the protagonist. She declared that she was the lone mistress of this rainy world. For how many years, decades, even centuries... Has she lived all alone in this world? Will the day come when the rain stops falling? Narcissu Bonus Episode Included in the game is a copy of Narcissu 1st, as well as a brand new VERY short bonus episode. It's very short, but hopefully is interesting for narcissu fans. Changing language region The game is playable in either English or Japanese, but due to technical constraints, there is no way to change the language within the game. However, it's possible to change the region for the game, as documented here: -WSCN-4121 NOTE To play the game in Japanese, your Windows installation needs to be set to handle non-unicode text as Japanese: -us/windows/change-system-locale#1TC=windows-7 If you experience issues, please email support(at)sekaiproject.com",
