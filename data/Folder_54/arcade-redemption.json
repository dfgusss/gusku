    "About the game": "Be prepared to put your skills and reflexes to the test in the ultimate rock and roll arcade experience! With a plethora of highly detailed physics-based redemption games inspired by real world classics, you will quickly amass a fistful of tickets redeemable for fabulous prizes and collectibles to fill you house. Play your way, rock your way, and let the tickets roll! Strategy You will need to develop a strategy on which games to play according to your current stats. Most games reward you with tickets, but others tokens or cash. So finding a balance is key to managing your token and cash flow to keep you in the action and winning tickets. Powerups A small cash investment at the vending machine allows you to double ticket payout values on all games for a limited duration. This can be renewed infinitely throughout the game, provided you have the cash. Jukebox An arcade would not be complete without the right music to set the tone. Choose from over 25 looping tracks from the game library or use the in-game web browsing feature and connect to your favorite media sources such as Youtube etc and rock out your way without having to open extra windows on your desktop.",
