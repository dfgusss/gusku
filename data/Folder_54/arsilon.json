    "About the game": "Arsilon - the adventure of astronaut Alice on another planet. After a crash landing, she needs to find and collect the lost spaceship components. On spacious maps, mortal dangers will lie in wait for her. To get to special places, you have to find a non-obvious path. Explore a new world, collect components and artifacts, learn the history of the planet. Using terrain orientation (open world) without an interactive map, you need to find and collect items. To get to some items, you will have to solve a logical problem in building a path (where to climb or jump). You need to be careful while traveling. You can crash, drown, die from unknown radiation. The task will become more difficult or easier depending on the time of day or the weather. If you get lost, you can always load from a save point. Also in this adventure you will be helped by the explorer's suit. It is equipped with a jump booster and a damage compensation system when falling from a great height. The amount of jumping charge increases as the game progresses.",
