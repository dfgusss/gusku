Invincible dash slash, powerful slash, 6 types of sub weapons. Make full use of various techniques to overcome the magic castle. == STORY == The mysterious Demon King descended from the other world and led a powerful army to conquer the earth. Many races surrendered to the Demon King and those that resisted were mercilessly exterminated. When everyone was about to give up hope.......without any warning, a brave man appeared. 'My name is Yasiyu........' The blue-haired man left that alone and set out. The Demon King, who was about to unite the earth, was praying in the temple. 'Come or Yasiyu let's settle this.' Putting an end to the repeated fate, that was also the purpose of the Demon King. He is the star of hope, the one who saves the earth, the one who is destined to be a brave man. In the eyes of the demons he is a hardcore executioner. == Game systems == The hero consumes SP when he uses the technique. SP will recover over time. The main character's HP decreases when it is attacked by an enemy. If HP becomes 0, it will be a mistake. If the hero makes a mistake, HP and SP will increase. Even people who are not good at action can clear it if they try without giving up. If you make a mistake, the score you get will decrease, and the score will decrease over time. Action gamers who are confident in their arms should aim for no mistakes and speed clearing. == Controls == It supports Xinput and DirectInput gamepads, but menu display and shutdown can only be operated with the keyboard. Please delete the recorded replay from Explorer. Please select joystick movement in the controller settings.",
