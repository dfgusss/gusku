    "About the game": "Capture Note is an app that makes the process of taking a screenshot and typing on it to save it as an image quickly and easily. Since video media such as Youtube became mainstream, we receive almost all information through video. And as you get information, you will naturally need to take notes. In this case, we manually type in everything we need and sometimes add screenshots. However, in this process, there is a waste of re-entering information included in the video, or there is a hassle of saving and attaching screenshots. With Capture Note, you can take notes without this waste. Capture Note can help you complete the three steps of taking a screenshot, adding a note, and saving it with minimal input.",
