    "About the game": "Cartridge Defense is a tower defense game with collectible cards that you will use to create your own decks to defend against robots in the cyberpunk inspired future. Play cards (cartridges) to spawn towers, upgrades, special abilities and more. Place towers to repath the enemy robots, set the priorities of towers with a highly customizable set of targeting systems, and watch waves of enemies get destroyed by your maze of towers. Each enemy has a chance of dropping loot in the form of cards, packs, targeting systems, items or resources you can use to customize your deck. There are currently 9 tower types, each of which can be upgraded to level 5 and 287 distinct cards, ensuring massive amounts of variety and replayability. Unlock cards, targeting systems and playable items by progressing through the story against specific spawn lists or farming completed levels with randomly generated spawns in 'Sponsored Mode' for bonus loot. There are currently 30 levels across 4 zones for an expected 25-30 hours of gameplay. Additionally, the early access release will include a new roguelike mode that we are working on and will continue to shape based on user feedback. Coming to Steam Early Access on September 3, 2020!",
