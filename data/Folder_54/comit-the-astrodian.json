    "About the game": "Story: The evil space pirate Krater has dispatched his robotic army to capture all of the planets in the system. The only hope to stop him is Comit the Astrodian, a meteor man from the planet Astrodia who has a rocket pack attached to his back. Kick Krater off each planet and take back the system. Comit's Abilities: Comit can use his rocket pack to boost and double jump his way through each stage while collecting yellow and red stars that give him lives or allow him to entire bonus stages. Development: Comit is designed like early 90's platformers because it was actually created back then on paper. The first prototype was created in 2011. The current incarnation started development in January of 2016. While simple in formula, the game was created to hold true to it's original 1994 blueprint with the addition of a save system that was created to accommodate the modern style of game.",
