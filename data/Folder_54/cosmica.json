    "About the game": "Cosmica is a rogue-like deckbuilder-focused space adventure where your combat deck is based on the crew and equipment you upgrade during each strategic run. Strategic Gameplay combined with deck manipulation and ability boosting is the unique focus for each battle your ship and crew will encounter. Your deck is fully visible allowing savvy players to plan several moves in advance, as they determine the best options to manipulate your deck and your chances of survival. Twelve Unique Characters are at your disposal to build a unique deck for each playthrough. Characters come with interesting abilities and backgrounds. Rich Storytelling is one of our goals to stand-out from the crowd as you dive deeper into the rich, continually evolving universe. Your actions will unlock unique items and rewards, or penalties that are dependant on the crew you bring on each adventure. Early Access was our decision to gain a community of passionate gamers that are supportive of our vision. We have big plans for Cosmica, which we will share in our detailed development roadmap.",
