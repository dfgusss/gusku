    "Release date": "Oct 18, 2021",
    "About the game": "Get ready to put your skills and your mind to the test. Cubes of Death is played from a 3D grid view and has both a story mode and an arcade mode (with randomized settings). 6 skill levels include everything a beginner needs to get into the game, a more challanging mode for the quick-thinker and GOD-MODE, for those of you that really think you will be reincarnated as a box your life after this. The 6th mode is where you get to measure your skills with your friends, allowing you to customize a course entirely for your needs, using a seed to replay same map as your friend and compare your scores and times. In future settings we are implementing PvP as 1 on 1 and up to 4 players in a battle royale style where players compete for time capsules, one-time-use-weapons and re-usable traps. The story-mode will hopefully get a co-op mode in the middle of 2022 and after that, we will see what you, our player-base asks for. Our ears are here for you so please send us ideas for future releases, we want Cubes of Death to be fun, fastpaced and re-playable.",
