In 201x, an anti-cancer research institute announced the discovery of the key to eternal life. In response to this breakthrough, Faith Energy Company concocted a vaccine-driven startup, the “Human X Plan.” However, the vaccine failed, with disastrous results: All infected humans were turned into zombies. The area where you live has been severely affected. To survive, and uncover the conspiracy surrounding the Human X Plan, you begin your journey. During your travels, you will meet the poor, beautiful mother and her daughter in the police station, the doctor at Smith Hospital, the cunning liar, the developmentally and physically disabled man, the jealous beauty, and the twin brothers with distinct personalities. Do you want to see them all survive to the end? At what cost? What secrets will you uncover in the abandoned tapes, newspapers, magazines and files that you find along your way? Will you gain the wisdom AND discover the password necessary to escape? “Delivery From The Pain” is a strategic survival game with a fantastic storyline.
