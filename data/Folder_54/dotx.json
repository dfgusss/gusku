    "About the game": "DotX is a 'mouse only' game, where you will challenge your ability to control the mouse, as well as verify your emotional resistance. Pick up the dots and avoid bumping into the walls, as long as your health bar doesn't reach zero. 100 dynamic and vibrant levels, where you will need the whole of your agility, reaction time, and the mouse handling skill. Look out! Every other 10th level has an increased difficulty. Enhance and demonstrate your skills by activating one to three challenge modes: - Hard Mode - dots become smaller and speed of the level increases. - Darkness Mode - playing area plunges into darkness. - Perfect Mode - demonstrate an absolutely perfect level walkthrough. - Steam Achievements - Steam Cloud",
