    "About the game": "Take the role of Wimachtendink, God of Islands, as you guide your faithfull Sea Dragon friend, Wingolousik, to eat magic orbs and create island worlds! There are a few things you need to know while partnering with Wingolausich: 1) He will bite his own tail if you are not careful, 2) He is a bit agoraphobic. Fortunately we have a magic barrier which keeps him feeling secure, so as long as you don't lead him outside the boundaries he will be fine. The tail biting thing isn't a big deal, as long as you are careful and don't guide him into his tail, you should be able to prevent him biting it. If you do let him bite his tail or go outside his comfort zone, he will return to his home under the sea, but you just need to restart his song and he will be fine to continue collecting orbs for you. Dragon Guide is easy to learn but hard to master, as you guide Wingolausich around the play space his tail will become longer which presents an increasing challenge to navigate around, if you can manage this and keep up with Wingolausich's increasing speed, you will have a front row seat to the creation of a unique island world every time you play! For those who want a challenge, there is also a timed trial game mode where you must find the quickest path through a collection of randomly placed magic orbs. with game modes for 10, 100, 1000, and 10000 pieces! Great game for those whose PC is a little underpowered for other VR games. - - Leaderboards and Achievements Coming Soon!!",
