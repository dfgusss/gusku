    "About the game": "From the creators of Seven Days and LOST:SMILE, LIFE0 presents their third game with art by Miko and story written by Major Tom: 「Dreamin' Her」 a romantic occult adventure game that follows the life of Aoi Igarashi. After encountering a strange woman in his dreams, Aoi’s life begins to change. As you progress through the story, you will be faced with many choices, each influencing the outcome of the story. What destiny will you choose? Story: In the final summer of highschool, Aoi Igarashi lives a boring, tired life. Day in and day out, he studies for college entrance exams at the behest of his mother. He’s unable to focus on his writing and struggles with writer’s block. The only time he is able to find peace is with his childhood friend Mirai Nanase. One day, she suddenly starts ignoring Aoi without explanation. His life begins to fall apart; his dreams fill with despair, and he starts to question if he has any purpose. That is until—she—appears in his dreams standing alone in front of a beautiful ocean, soft pink sand underfoot, bearing Mirai’s likeness: the girl of his dreams… begins overflowing into reality.
