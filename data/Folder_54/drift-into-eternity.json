Explore and chart the ship for materials to repair its many devices, for food and water to prevent starvation, and try to keep your morale up to avoid fatal depression. Repair the many damages slowly tearing apart the ship: close the breaches, repair its many devices, fight the many electrical fires, cleanse the corrosive and lethal atmosphere slowly infiltrating the hull. Use the help of a sarcastic AI to gather the mandatory knowledge of your surroundings. Study, craft, research and upgrade your tools to improve your chances of survival.
