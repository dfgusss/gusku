    "About the game": "Is playing recorder always the same? Is it not exciting? Well, that's different with Flute Master! Here you will learn to play soprano recorder while experiencing a great adventure in the world of music. Everyone can learn it! The notes you play will be detected over the device's microphone. Just install it and start right away! Please Note: ⚠ Flute Master requires a real recorder (the flute instrument)! ⚠ Use headphones if you can. This helps the game listen only to your recorder. In Flute Master, you and Oratio will help the dragon Cornelius protect his tower of strawberries from the greedy bats. Yes, in the World of Music, bats love strawberries! You'll play a lot of unique music tracks that gradually teach you each note on your recorder. By the time you finish the game, you'll be able to play great recorder tunes! ;) Try to score as high as you can and... scare away those bats! Features: ✔ Game-based learning to introduce you to the recorder. ✔ Real-time detection of the instrument, using your microphone. ✔ 27 original music tracks composed by music education professionals. ✔ Available in several languages: English, German, Spanish, French and Portuguese (PT and BR). ✔ Interactive learning system for recorder fingering positions, music theory and sheet music reading. ✔ Notes associated with colours, for easier recognition. ✔ A scoring system that encourages self-improvement. ✔ An amusing story with cute characters ✔ Ready for classroom use. Flute Master is part of the Classplash Music series and focuses on teaching the basics of recorder flute by gradually introducing each note in a game environment, showing correct recorder fingering positions and providing music sheets for all tracks. Teachers can use Flute Master to great effect during classes. By teaching through gaming, especially kids, it increases their engagement and makes the learning experience much more productive! Does the content follow the music curriculum? Yes! And even primary school teachers without a musical background can use it in the classroom. It's the result of a worldwide awarded project, which was developed with the collaboration of over 200 primary school students. Q: Why is it called Flute Master if it teaches the recorder? A: In some European countries - namely Portugal, where Classplash was born - 'flute' ( flauta ) refers to the recorder flute. Only when talking about other flutes do we specify the type of flute (ex: transverse flute). This felt easier to understand for some non-english languages. In addition, 'Recorder Master' was taken. ;)",
