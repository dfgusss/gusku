    "About the game": "Did you know, you are one of the very few who actually read this? Challenge Controlling all axes of a drone without stabilization, it just can't be that hard, right? Riding a bicycle is easy, but do you remember how hard it was to learn? In Hard2Fly you can practice and learn the basic controls of flying a FPV drone in a not so serious environment. After the initial 'what the actual ****'-moment, players usually make good progress and start going stunt flying or beat their friends in timed racing. Crashing (a lot) Brace-Brace! Your drone is crashable. You will notice - guaranteed. Learn from mistakes, crashes and failures. Hard2Fly kindly reminds you of them by leaving Debris where you crashed unless you want it to be removed. Fly 'round Once it got to you - relax your mind, enjoy the sensation of being free like a bird. Time Race your friends Of course there is a global leaderboard for every track, but also a short list to see how your friends are doing and challenge their LAP times. Crash some more (a lot more) Did I mention crashes yet? Do you like crashing? Turn on or off up to 99 of your own ghosts, race them or have a wreck festival. Conclusion? Hard2Fly is for you if You like tricky challenges to build a skill Like crashing drones Want a game to be just a game No-Fly restrictions from your local aerospace restrict you from adding annoying sound emissions to the sky Your PC has enough performance to simulate a ton of ghost drones, crashes and debris You thought drones were a toy, but realized they are dangerous - now you still want to have fun in a safe-to-others environment Hard2Fly is likely NOT for you if You are looking for true realism and absolute perfectly accurate simulation to become the world best FPV drone racer and win every single race you'll ever attempt.",
