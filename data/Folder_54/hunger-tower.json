Legend has it that the tower lies at the end of the world and that it was born from the catastrophe. Although this is a cursed place, it is said that at the top of the tower lies precious treasures and powers strong enough to rule the world. Many brave and greedy people often enter the tower for the power that lies on top, and some people are thrown into the tower as a punishment. Very few people can survive the horrors of the tower.
