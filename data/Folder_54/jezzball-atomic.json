    "About the game": "JezzBall Atomic is a remake of the classic Windows game JezzBall. You’re tasked with capturing the Jezz atoms that are bouncing around inside each chamber by building new walls and trapping them in a smaller space. But be careful, incomplete walls can’t withstand the impact of a Jezz atom! 3 game play modes are included: Classic , Arcade and Survival . Classic is a homage to the original JezzBall by Dima Pavlovsky and features the same rules and chamber size to allow players to experience the classic on modern devices. Arcade includes 40 levels across much larger chambers and features different Jezz atom types with unique characteristics. Survival is a new mode where you start with 10 lives with 1 life granted at the start of each level.",
