    "About the game": "Jormungandr , son of Loki, has just been cast out of Asgard into the seas of Midgard by Odin. Prophecy tells that Jormungandr will grow so large that he will wrap around Midgard to grasp his own tail. If Jormungandr should lose his grip, it will set about the events of Ragnarok. 40 levels gives you an easy introduction but ramps up in difficulty fast. Multiple ship types. The bigger the ship, the more damage they do. Rechargeable boost to give you that quick burst of speed when you need it most. Procedurally generated worlds that get bigger with each new level.",
