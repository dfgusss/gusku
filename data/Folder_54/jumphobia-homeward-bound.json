    "About the game": "Bounce into the distant future of Euro Nova, one of the last surviving cities on a scorched Earth after a century of corporate war. At the heart of this dark metropolis is a courier jump-bot who delivers packages throughout the many layers of the city, but finds himself in unfamiliar territory when he is uprooted from his humble workaday life and cast out in favour of a newer model. With the help of a newfound canine friend, he sets off on a journey to get back home - the long way round. Story Mode Play through 30 varied story levels, with a host of puzzles and obstacles to conquer - can you beat them all? Or is this all too easy for you? Then maybe you need to try the challenge mode! Break some records and smash those times. Test your personal best if you think you are good enough. As you play, you’ll collect all sorts of nuts, bolts and discarded scrap to spend on customising your robot. Make that lovable little jump-bot your own with some crazy colour schemes and sleek redesigns. Gameplay As the name suggests, Jumphobia is a game built around the premise of getting from 'A' to 'B' by jumping - but not when you want to! All Jump-bots are built with a failsafe to limit their manoeuvrability, meaning that you as the player can only automatically jump when you reach the edge of a drop or platform. That's right - it's a platforming game without a jump button! You can’t jump by choice, so it's going to mean taking a much less direct route home for our mechanical chum - you'll need to think on your feet, so to speak! Level World Think you can do better than us? Design your own levels in our level builder. Assemble wild contraptions and deadly traps to fool even the smartest of players, and then share your creations with the community and flummox your friends and foes alike with your ingenious inventions. Forge your own and become a master level builder, or browse the level world menu in search of a worthy challenge and rise to stardom setting records, earning medals and adorning your jump-bot's profile with all your achievements. Send your jump-bot homeward bound and navigate through this treacherous and exciting future! Explore, problem-solve and navigate your way through the world of Jumphobia! /",
