    "About the game": "Test the limits of your reaction time, memory, dexterity, and focus. As bamboo and other obstacles rhythmically float toward you, thrust both of your katanas into the correct orientation with the right timing to chop through them. There are many different obstacles and levels to overcome! Each katana orientation is linked to a button on your keyboard. Controlling both katanas at the same time leads to developing left hand and right hand independence, similar to playing the piano. Features Original soundtrack with a dynamic melody you create as you play A series of endless procedurally generated levels that get faster over time Obstacles that provide a unique challenge both on their own, and when combined with other obstacles A colorful and pleasant environment Daily challenges Leaderboards",
