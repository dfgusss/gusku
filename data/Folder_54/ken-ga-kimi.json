One day, a Tokugawa samurai came with an order of life and death, that is, disguising as the princess and joining in the false bridal procession. The samurai said that Kayo and the princess are two peas in a pod. Thinking that the food and tea house would be hard to run if she refuses, Kayo set her mind to accept this assignment and started her trip in Tōkaidō. In this visual novel, you will play the role of Kayo to interact with the samurais. You can control the storyline with different selections and unlock 24 endings of 6 main characters.
