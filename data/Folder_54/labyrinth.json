The Labyrinth of Crete was an elaborate, confusing structure designed and built by the legendary artificer Daedalus for King Minos of Crete at Knossos. Its function was to hold the Minotaur, the illigitimate stepson of King Minos. For many years, the people of athens had to provide food for the Minotaur in the form of human sacrifice. They did this by sending their criminals to the Labyrinth. You are one such criminal. Will you escape? Will you meet the Minotaur? Only one way to find out...
