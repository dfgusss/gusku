    "About the game": "You wake up in a tent in a dark forest. Where are you? Why are you here? What are these strange lights that seem to show you the way? You discover notes. Diary entries from the past. Are you searching for someone? Then all of a sudden you stand in front of a dark tunnel entrance. You overcome the strong urge to run away ... and enter ... Lost in the Rift - Reborn is an exploration-type game that sends you on a journey to face your fears and uncover the gruesome past. An intense trip that certainly isn't for the faint-hearted. Lost in the Rift had been initially developed as one of the very first VR horror games, following the success of its predecessor Alone in the Rift . With Lost in the Rift - Reborn the game has received a complete overhaul, many additional features and is now also finally available for the HTC Vive and Vive controllers. To ensure the best experience, it is highly recommended to play this game using headphones and while standing.",
