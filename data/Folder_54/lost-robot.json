    "About the game": "In the not so distant future, 2085 a future where robots and humans live peacefully. Until they don't. A robot named DR-32 wakes to a distress signal that he must save the princess. The princess has been kidnapped and her whereabouts are unknown. DR-32 was the princess's captain of the guard and her own personal attendant. He feels responsible for her and he must get her back. Journey with DR-32 as he jumps through portals of space and time to save her. Lost Robot is a 3D Action RPG. A real hack and slash as DR-32 searches for the princess. There are 5 levels in the game from a space lab to a distant forest in the galaxy, the portals transport you from one level to the next. DR-32 picks up as many gears as possible. He never knows if he may break down so he collects them. Our Hero: DR-32 is a little short for his taste but makes up for it in spunk. He has one goal to find the princess. He won't let anything stand in his way. His abilities include super sprinting, super sword slash and he jumps pretty well for a robot. The jumping and sword slash come naturally however with sprinting you will run out of stamina. When your stamina runs out you'll need to wait as it recharges. Our Princess: Amelia is a confident young princess. She was kidnapped by some rogue sentry robots. She waits anxiously for her captain of the guard DR-32 to save her. Our Enemies: Rogue Robots originally of the royal guard. These robots have taken the princess and now want to get rid of their old captain of the guard DR-32. Each robot has titanium blades and will slash through metal.",
