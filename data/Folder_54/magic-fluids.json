    "About the game": "Magic Fluids is a relaxing, colorful simulation app that will help you calm down and relieve stress, or be creative and make aesthetic digital art. It is based on algorithms of fluid flow simulation and features fluid (pun intented!), beautiful graphics. It is the best time waster! CLICK THE SCREEN and enjoy hypnotizing motion of fluid swirls moving around, sometimes slow, quiet and elegant, other times dynamic, satisfying and trippy. CALM DOWN AND RELAX as you draw and watch peaceful flows evolve in space and eventually settle down into colorful patterns. Magic Fluids will help you sleep, meditate, restore balance, relieve stress and anxiety. GET CREATIVE and, with a single stroke, bring to life stylish patterns of paint and particles. If you like abstract digital art or acrylic pour painting, you'll love Magic Fluids! You can create impressive eye-catching designs that look like swirls, galaxies, liquid, fire, light, smoke, lava and much more! KEEP YOUR KIDS BUSY - they love to doodle and watch the fluid move around! We hope that Magic Fluids can also help children with anxiety, autism and sensory issues. Please note: This is not a live wallpaper! (If you'd really like this feature, let us know.) Key features of Magic Fluids: - Highly configurable fluid behaviour and look - 40+ configuration presets - if you're lazy - Save your own presets - Pause the animation anytime and save screenshots - Smoke, water and jello animation - 10 fluid textures that add fine detail to the fluid - Thousands of particles moving with the fluid - Highly optimized, multiple quality settings",
