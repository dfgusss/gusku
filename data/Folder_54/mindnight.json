    "About the game": "MINDNIGHT is a free to play online social deduction game, a take on the classic party games such as Werewolf and The Resistance. It is a game of deceit, accusations and unpredictability. It challenges the player's ability to lie and detect other players that are lying. Online Matchmaking 5-8 players 3 Game Modes Custom Games with Voice Chat Customization - 100 Skins Chat Features - 30 Custom Emojis Set in a future cyberpunk San Francisco, in 2038, cities have crushed the open internet. Networks are locked by security nodes and need to be maintained by NTF agents. Hackers have been searching for a way to break into them for years. HOW TO PLAY Players are assigned a random role to be either an Agent or a Hacker. In order to win the game with your team you must capture three nodes. Hackers have the objective to hack three nodes while Agents need to secure three nodes from the total of five. As a hacker you know who your fellow hackers are, but as an agent, you only know who you are. ‰‰ Secure. Seek. Subvert. ¬þ±± The game is a tribute to social party games such as The Resistance and Werewolf. As MINDNIGHT is heavily inspired after these games, we are looking into other table-top deduction social games to bring new features and modes along the way through updates. MINDNIGHT is a game that was created initially in an internal game jam. Last but not least, we recommend playing the game in English, when playing in the normal queue. You can always create custom games with your friends and play in your own language if you cannot communicate in English.",
