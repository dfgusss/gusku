    "About the game": "Minecart Madness is a 2D arcade infinite-runner in the style of early platforming games. Take on the role of an ape in a minecart and ride the rails as far as you can while dodging inbound minecarts and leaping over gaps in the track. The game features a variety of game modes, each introducing new challenges and gameplay opportunities: Classic - standard, balanced gameplay Superflat - like classic, but all track segments generate at the same vertical height Low gravity - enables longer air time at the expense of jump accuracy Too much brake - near-limitless braking ability Ultra mega - enemy carts spawn more frequently and move faster Late start - start with more points and gain an initial speed-boost Crocodile craze - holes don't spawn, and enemies spawn more frequently No holes barred - enemies don't spawn, and holes spawn more frequently All game modes can also be played with two players on the same system in split-screen multiplayer. Minecart Madness supports keyboard and controller input modes for one or two players. All inputs are customizable.",
