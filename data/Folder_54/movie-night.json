    "About the game": "Ever wanted to just chill and watch videos with your friends at the same time without the need of screensharing? Introducing Movie Night a casual online multiplayer game allowing players to create their own virtual private cinema. Movie Night is and will always be free to play with absolutely NO micotransactions, paid DLC, or subscriptions. Create a room with up to 12 other players with full control over what is played on your cinema screen with just a youtube URL. Once a player creates their own private cinema they will become the room master giving control to request any youtube video. As players join the cinema they will immediately sync up to the timestamp of the room master even if the video is skipped ahead. If the room master leaves another player will become the master giving them control (passing the remote).",
