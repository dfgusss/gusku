    "About the game": "Nary will seem hard if you have no previous experience with platformers. You'll see many flashes and particles in this game. Nary works best when played on a keyboard . Nary combines many great features of both the platformer and runner genres and builds upon them! - Each foe's health is represented not by dull hearts, but by a special set of arrows! In order to damage the enemy, you'll have to press the corresponding keys on your keyboard! - In addition to destroying your enemies, you'll have to keep an eye on the obstacles and avoid running into them. And, in this case, merely remembering the level layout won't be enough, because each level is randomly generated every time you die! - What makes Nary even more replayable is an abundance of game modes , which can turn the gameplay on its head. - Once you leave the relatively easy and relaxing Deserted Paradise, you'll get into more hardcore levels. If you want to beat them, you'll need to master some special abilities to stay alive! Your arsenal will include the following skills: Gravity Switch , Dash , Double Jump and Vine Dodge . - If you're up for a challenge, Nary is here to test your platforming expertise and multitasking abilities!",
