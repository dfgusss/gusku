    "About the game": "Objective H.A.S.T.E. - is a first-person 3D survival game in the horror genre. Have you ever imagined that your school could be under attack by terrorists, so the only good thing would be that the lessons would be canceled? I bet you did. This game can allow you to visit such a situation. Game Process: You play as a brave student, trapped in the school who wants to find out what really happened and save his sister, who was taken hostage by bad cultists. The name of the game speaks for itself - to escape because the cultists do not want you to come back alive with the knowledge of what really happened. It won't be so easy. Your enemies know how to run, set traps, remember where have you gone, and even have their own unique characteristics! Game features: ⦁ Advanced Tablet. During the whole game, you will have access to the tablet with which you can connect to cameras, speakers, and drone near you. Also, there will be a messenger with a curious history. ⦁ Flying drone. Unlike other classic horror-survival games, we allow you to play for the drone, which can help you avoid enemies, take and drop items! ⦁ One HUGE school location which consists of 100 different classes, dining room, sports hall. A large number of various tools, locks, and game situations. ⦁ 7 horrible cultists ⦁ 6 different difficulty modes ⦁ Different ways to finish the game ⦁ Also, don’t forget to charge your devices and avoid hunger or thirst So that's it... We wish you good luck and remember: “Always check cameras near you”.",
