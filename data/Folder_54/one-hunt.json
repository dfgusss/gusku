    "About the game": "One Hunt is a condensed hardcore survival game. One Hunt uses straightforward mechanics that don't over complicate the experience. This hostile environment is teeming with danger. The weather is brutal, the predators are abundant, and the One You Hunt is fierce. In order to survive, you must collect sticks to create fires, find ammo to keep your shotgun loaded, and keep your ears keen to the One You Hunt. Throughout the map there are cabins that can keep you out of the cold. They also contain useful items like snowshoes, ammo, and parkas. Can you survive this hostile environment and claim the One You Hunt?",
