Transforming allows you to climb steep walls, slide ceilings, and jump midair to avoid deadly machinery. One Watcher is easy to learn but hard to master. You're the Last Guardian and on your mission to defeat the Watcher and save your kind. Bumpers, lasers, magnets, gravity fields, rack wheels, flame throwers, rockets, blades, and the hunters are out to kill you. 66 levels in 4 chapters will challenge your dexterity while leading you to 4 different regions. You will explore the infinite depths of the lost planet, master the trials of the burned South, and overcome the obstacles of the frozen North in order to reach outer space and challenge the Watcher.",
