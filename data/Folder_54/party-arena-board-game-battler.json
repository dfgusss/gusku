Fast games (20 minutes total)! Fun for any evening or night with friends! What is Party Arena Party Arena is a 2-4 player turn based strategy board game + action mini-games mashup. After each round on the board game you compete in an action mini game, which then determines turn order and awards for the board game. Use items to push, pull, and deal damage to other players and affect their ability to get goblets and win the game. Using and combining items really makes the game. More item usage = more fun. Try to give the game a second play through at least once you learn the rules and how everything works. We are just a 2 man team. We're still adding content and fixing bugs.
