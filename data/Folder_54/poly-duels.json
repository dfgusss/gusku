    "About the game": "Fight your friends in this fast paced, easy to learn, hard to master fantasy brawler! Dodge, block, parry, and jump over attacks! Confuse your enemy by varying the tempo and types of your combos! The Game Each of the 7 characters has a 3-hit combo and 2 special attacks that they can mix with mix into the sequence to surprise their opponents. Some attacks cannot be blocked and need to be jumped over in order not to take damage. Every kind of attack can also be dodged, and some MUST be dodged. Be careful not to rely on dodging too much becouse it's expensive in stamina! If you time your block and press it in the exact moment an enemy's attack lands, you will parry the attack and regain most of your stamina. This also blocks the opponent from continuing his combo and gives you a chance to retaliate Characters Choose from 7 characters, each with 3 variants modifying the character's skillset: Amon - The Demon King Lord of the underworld. Utilizes his flaming staff to apply a burn effect forcing an aggressive playstyle Siegfried - The Hollow Guardian A cursed suit of living armor with exceptional strength and health. His attacks may be slow but they hit hard Longdarion - The Father A nimble warrior of the forest people. His blade draws fast and raches far Satoru - The Sensei A sage whose mastery of the naginata is legendary. His kick allows him to weaken an enemy's posture Ito - The Blademaster A samurai with his mind set on revenge of his clan. His devastating combos leave enemies cowering behind defensive stances Seiichi - The Betrayer A disgraced ninja, who once served the Ito family. His short blade is fast and deadly, but his clothing provides little defense Alyss - The Shieldbearer An adventurer from the far west. Her shield provides defense from all kinds of attacks, but limits her movements",
