    "About the game": "PROJECT AURA is a simulation/strategy videogame where you take control of a colony of climate disaster survivors. In the near future, humans will face the drastic consequences of climate change. Forced to take refuge in vital reserves using cryo-preservation, they await a second chance. At the end of the 21st century, humans — finally aware of the great climate disaster — dedicated their efforts not on preventing the inevitable crisis, but to ensure the survival of the species itself. In this endeavor, they embarked on the construction of a network of cities on the sea, resistant to the hostile atmosphere. Overtaken by the events and extreme food shortage, they built ultra-secret shelters that would support them in hibernation, to be awakened in a more favorable situation. FEATURES ■ Lead a colony of climate disaster survivors ■ Take control of a colony starting from a state of zero development. ■ Manage, train and specialize your citizens who will learn their assigned tasks. ■ Create a suitable habitat to incorporate more citizens to your colony. ■ Exploit and develop technology in your hands to improve your infrastructure, production and research. ■ Construct new buildings and platforms to expand your city. ■ Specialize your colony, trade or go for self-sufficiency. ■ Explore and rescue valuable remains from the civilization of the 21st century. ■ Reuse components from the past, and craft unique items * Get ready to discover a new formula of innovative gameplay!",
