The second wave covered Mother Russia and caught on to Santa's residence, but it's not that simple... Terrorist organization has teamed up with coronavirus to strike a double blow! Each level - new challenges, you fight with the virus, with zombies, mutant terrorists and mutant zombie terrorists who have a virus. You have to go around the entire Santa's residence, with the help of your strong arms and powerful fighting chest, free the poor people from the coronavirus and terrorists. The game is a corridor shooter in the spirit of the 90's. You will have to go through a variety of mazes, shoot back from hordes of enemies, collect treasures, and most importantly-find a way out on each of the levels! Most significantly, don't forget the Christmas spirit! Feature of game: - Christmas rescue story (like 'Die Hard', but better); - Old school design; - Christmas atmosphere of the 90's; - Unique musical accompaniment on each level; - Save Christmas from the insidious virus and terrorists at the same time!; - Get into the body of the last superhero before he gets into yours!",
