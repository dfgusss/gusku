Sometimes, pursuing his goals, a person doesn't think about the consequences. Only one single thought appears in his head - to get what he wants by any means. This is exactly what happened with the main character - Henry. Having discarded all possible options, he decided to commit theft. Arriving at the place, Henry found what was needed, but the price was too high. Waking up from a severe headache, the main character finds himself in a well. What will you do now? Be with Henry. Immerse yourself in the atmosphere of this world, go all the way from the beginning to the end and find out why it all happened.",
