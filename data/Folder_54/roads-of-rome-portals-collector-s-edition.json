    "About the game": "A valiant Centuria was returning home after a victorious campaign. Suddenly, a storm, which was rapidly approaching the ship, appeared on the horizon. The team prepared for the worst. A monstrous storm broke out. The ship was tossed from side to side, and giant waves were covering it one after another. The squad was already saying their last farewells to life. The incredible storm, having played enough with the ship, smashed it like a toy on the rocks of a deserted island. Fortunately, many managed to survive. The small, lifeless island seemed to promise nothing but death. The surviving centurians wandered through it in search of food, but found only the entrance to the cave. The Romans entered the cave. And they froze in surprise when they saw something strange and magical in front of them, something that looked like a portal. After a brief consultation, the squad decided to meet their fate and go into this portal. There was nothing else they could do. And they bravely stepped into the unknown.
