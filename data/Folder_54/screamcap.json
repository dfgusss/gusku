    "About the game": "Welcome to ScreamCap, a visual novel of supernatural mystery and romance! Overview: ScreamCap is a rising team of paranormal investigators live streaming their dives into the unknown to their audience of believers. Usually, things are pretty tame, but something strange has begun stalking one of their own and in order to rid themselves of it they must follow a trail of strange clues, talk to some ghosts (or chemtrails, depending on who you ask), and maybe just get to know each other a little better. Characters: Charlie is our host with the most! He's a cryptozoologist who loves long walks on the beach and is NOT afraid to punch the Jersey Devil, again. Morgan is our co-star and resident psychic. When she's not bending spoons with her mind or communing with the recently deceased, she likes to meditate on life and love. Scout is our producer and tech geek extraordinaire. She carries a bat to keep the show running. You should be mindful of that.  Raz is tonight’s client! He’s a bit nervous since his house started being haunted or whatever.  Features: A choice-based visual novel with a wholly original world and 2D art style. Unique Chat Window displays the in-game audience’s reactions to your choices and decisions.  Multiple, cool and kooky companions to solve mysteries and find romance with.  A variety of spooky locales to search and creepy supernatural entities to encounter.  Make Your Own ScreamCap Content We are licensing for reuse all of the original characters, art, and story from this game under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.
