    "About the game": "Intrigue, corporations, lies, criminal structures, a frightening future, irreversible consequences. Welcome to the Song of Farca, a dark and cruel Black Mirror-esque novel. You are Isabella Song, a private detective, and hacker who has to investigate a series of crimes. Can you uncover them using only gadgets, an army of drones, and your mind? As your investigation proceeds, the stakes will rise, different episodes become woven into the one story, and decisions will become increasingly difficult. Get information by any means: Use darknet search and artificial intelligence, hack drones and study surveillance footage, blackmail, or interrogate. Create a cloud of leads and analyze evidence: Will you blame the most suspicious character or dig deeper? Draw the right conclusions to get the truth: The victim may turn out to be a criminal, and the suspect is just one link in a criminal chain. Feel the consequences of wrong decisions: Are you ready to commit a crime yourself to save your loved ones?",
