    "About the game": "Soulfire is a souls-like, side scroller action competitive game, integrating (stitching) multiple game modes, including the classic battle royale mode. In the enhanced version of 'Weapon Master', you can choose your favorite type from a large number of cold weapons, and practice constantly to unlock its powerful abilities. In addition, you can also use a variety of secondary weapons, spells, and props to create a wealth of combat strategies. Whether it is melee, long-range, or support, there will always be a fighting style that suits you. May you survive to the end in the cruel dungeon fighting! Compared to original Soulfire title, Weapon Master have the following noticeable changes: 1. Almost all of the game code have been rewritten. This resulted in much optimized performance, reduced lags and fewer frame drops. 2. All servers are listed together; you have the chance to fight with players all around the world! 3. Battle tempo is a little faster, but it is still under tweaking. 4. Other experimental modifications, such as camera control, which may have a greater impact on the gaming experience.",
