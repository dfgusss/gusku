    "About the game": "Space Ducks: The great escape is part of the CosmOS 9 bundle , a set of 9 puzzle games discovered on a mysterious, alien video game console drifting through outer space. In this cosmic puzzle adventure, help a lost tribe of duck-people in their millennial quest for a stable world! In Space Ducks: The great escape , complete challenging Sokoban-like puzzles, by moving the Space Ducks in the right sequence, in order to reach the power source their ship requires and travel to the next planet . But tread lightly, as walking on loose ground will propel into space what ever is standing on the other side. One duck's progress could mean another duck´s demise! And even if a duck goes solo (years of living on precarious planets have turned the ducks into a somewhat callous people), remember that their is no escaping gravity and that one false move could bring your mission to a crashing conclusion. Features Help a tribe of duck-people escape 18+ puzzle planets , Travel across a colorful galaxy and visit 3 biomes , Learn and master original Sokoban inspired mechanics Harness gravity to reshape the planets to your needs Coordinate the ducks' efforts (or let them die trying) Enjoy the retro-classical art , dark humor and original music About Us 6Toad Games is a game making collective based in Barcelona, Spain.
