    "About the game": "SpaceBall in Cube is a game for those who want to relax from shooters, racing, arcade, etc. The game is suitable for people who like to play the argument, since the idea of the game is to recruit space spectacles. That is, to better understand the principle of the game you can imagine cosmic bowling in a cube, but the main thing here is not a throw, but the attraction of the ball on the opposite side of the cube. This is a simple game that resembles the famous bowling, only in the role of the skittle, we have squares in the center of the cube, and ball instead of inertial rotation flies. And so, to play in spaceball you need a few friends who like to bet on glasses and a computer mouse. Pushing the ball to the target is done by pressing the right mouse button, and pulling with the wheel of your mouse or 'Q'. By breaking new and new squares in a cube a space ball, get points and become the king of a cubic galaxy. And win all the arguments! Enjoy the Game!",
