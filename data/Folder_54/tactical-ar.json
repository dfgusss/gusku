    "About the game": "Tactical AR is a training platform for firearms skills in virtual reality. We make training engaging, and accessible to help individuals be prepared to protect life. Muscle memory, and reaction time is built through repetition, and measured through data. All of our weapon profiles can be recalibrated to make sure that what you see, matches the grip angle of the weapon you run in the real world. Our training courses are scored on time, to induce stress. Each course of fire tracks top scores to help measure improvement and consistency. Our platform makes heavy use of dynamic content, and provides tools for editing and creating additional content while in VR.
