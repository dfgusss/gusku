    "About the game": "TapRPG is back with the second installment. Continuing the story, our hero's home burnt to the ground and Golden Knight is no where to be found. He sets out following the evil across the land chasing answers and sworn to destroy the source of the evil. A mysterious side-kick joins you on this adventure as you hack, slash, and pillage to try and save your new friend's homeland to prevent your fate. A retro 2D style, action hack and slash game where you navigate an overworld map with your new side-kick. Enter dungeons to find 2D side scrolling levels where you hack and slash monsters to vanquish the evil bosses. A unique action battle system where your hero moves through the level automatically and you use your skill and timings to attack, defend, reflect, and jump over dangerous obstacles. The unique idle level grinding function is back. Enter a dungeon and don't press a thing as you watch your hero attempt to clear through the monsters using your current stats. If you die, the level will automatically restart again to grind some more. Handy for overcoming a difficult level where you need to power up some more. Earn XP to level up and spend your stat points buffing your hero. Pry the gold from monsters and adventuring to upgrade your equipment.",
