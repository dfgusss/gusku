    "About the game": "The invasion is never ending. The Terra Tanks' only hope is to destroy the mothership. Can you muster the strength to save humanity in our darkest hour? Features Your Score Is Your Health Your Terra Tank gains energy from blasting away alien scum. Terra Tanks lose more energy from each hit as they reach higher power levels, and running out of power will mean the doom of the human race. Your Score Unlocks Upgrades and Abilities Every 100 points will unlock your Terra Tank's next unique ability or upgrade for that round. Fight your way through hordes of aliens with lasers, rockets, grenades, explosive shell jumps, bullet time and so much more. Five Unlockable Tanks Each tank has a unique gun, upgrades and abilities custom tailored for their play styles. Carve through the invaders with Machine-Gun or bombard enemies from above with Orbital . Unlock each tank by successfully repelling alien invasions with a higher score. Difficulties For Everyone Terra Tanks has all the charm of an 80's arcade box without any of the hassle. Normal offers a more casual experience while Insane will give experienced players a true challenge. Higher difficulties grant score modifiers and more aliens to destroy. Radical 80's Inspired Soundtrack Terra Tank's soundtrack features a unique blend of 80's synth, hip-hop and spooky alien atmosphere for your xeno-blasting adventures. Credits Soundtrack &amp; Audio Design: Kimo The Beatmaker. Enemy &amp; Level Illustration: Fernando Angelo.",
