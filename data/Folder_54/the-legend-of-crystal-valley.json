    "About the game": "The Legend of Crystal Valley is a point n' click adventure game, based on story and exploration, set between the real and the fantasy world. The game was developed by an small indie team back in 2009 and finally it found its way to Steam in 2020.

We hope that the mix of reality, fantasy and science fiction is something you'll like.
