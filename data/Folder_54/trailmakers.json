    "About the game": "Build a car, plane or boat…Or mash ‘em all together as a transforming carplaneboat! Play your way and explore the Stranded in Space campaign, learn the basics of building (and piloting) various vehicles in Rally or go to one of the sandbox maps and build the hovercraft you’ve always dreamed of owning in real life! Our deceptively simple build mode lets you snap together blocks intuitively, so you can be up and running in moments… Or you can learn the intricacies of the system and build complex marvels. Customize the colors on your builds, or support development of the game with one of the Skin Packs to truly stand out! Play alone or up to eight players with drop in / drop out multiplayer game modes on most maps in Trailmakers. Build with or against your friends, and see who’s going to blaze the trail towards whatever goal you set for yourselves! Explore an alien planet and collect the parts you need to eventually escape it. Our campaign mode introduces you to the various types of vehicles the game is capable of making, and lets you explore different ways to use them. Explore our two sandbox maps, filled to the brim with jumps, halfpipes, catapults, an aircraft carrier and even more crazy obstacles.Play the game however you want - do Zen and the Art of Building Whatever You Like, or challenge yourself and your friends to do any of a vast variety of stunts and races to prove that *your* creation is the best, fastest or strongest! Learn the basics of building and piloting the various vehicles that can be made in Trailmakers in Rally mode, and then make a name for yourself on the global leaderboards against our community of Trailmakers. If you’re looking for more challenges, take a trip to scenic Race Island to truly prove your worth against the top racers in Trailmakers. Enjoy Steam Workshop support to share your creations or mods, or see what other players have come up with, then join our lovely Discord community to keep up with the latest news, and find people to play with, exchange build ideas &amp; challenge your building skills.",
