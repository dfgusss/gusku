    "About the game": "Train Sim World is an immersive first-person simulator perfect for everyone, with complete in-cab interactivity, accurate detail on locos, real-world routes and hours of gameplay. Take to the rails with the brand-new Train Sim World 2020 Edition and find everything you need to master new skills, from general to advanced operation of locomotives as you operate smooth passenger and freight services, scenarios and much more. START A NEW JOURNEY Train Sim World puts you in the engineer’s seat of breathtakingly authentic machines. Balance your brake pressure, control your speed, manage refuelling, switching, yard work and more. The ‘Journeys’ feature will guide you through over 24 real hours of scenarios, tutorials and service timetables for each route – plus a new progress tracker will highlight hundreds of railway jobs available for you to complete as you master the routes. EXPERIENCE AUTHENTIC SIMULATION Powered by SimuGraph®, Train Sim World locomotives accurately recreate not only the appearance of their real-world counterparts, but also under-the-hood physics, cabs, control desks, sounds and even the feel of the trains. All of this is set on a collection of real-world routes from around the world. Fight your way up Germany’s Spessartrampe incline, navigate the sprawling underground station at New York Penn or simply gape at the cavernous wonder of Manchester’s Victoria Station – and on every route you’ll find true-to-life regional signalling systems and a brand-new set of challenges. MASTER THE RAILS Step into any Train Sim World cab and you’ll be greeted with the same sight as any engineer – banks of controls ready for your command, giving you power over every aspect of your locomotive’s operation. In Train Sim World 2020 we’re taking you one step further with updates to the sim experience such as the new Action Point scoring system that rewards you for accuracy and debriefing screen will help you track your performance.
