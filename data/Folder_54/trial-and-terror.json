A game for lovers of weird and odd puzzles that require a combination of problem-solving and correct timing. Leaderboard included! Claim your place as the best player of Trial and Terror. Key features Compete against other players in our competitive leaderboard! Every level has its own leaderboard. Minimalist design Surreal and abstract puzzles Simple mechanics, slide your way through without getting touched by enemies Reviews The look of this game reminds me of old Atari 2600 games, or early-era computer games, where everything was so dark and sketchy, with changing colors and strange shapes moving in bizarre patterns, that the experience could be surreal and creepy. In spite of the minimalist approach, I found the game interesting to look at. That was an amazing game! Interesting music. Good variety and creativity in each level, not to hard but not too easy. It's very engaging, and a good exercise for the mind, never boring in Trial And Terror! P.S. That title is absolutely ingenious. It really is a trial and error game, the 'terror' being having to worry about those little moving stars. Great Job! Really enjoyable game! I actually didn't mind the music either, probably because I was concentrating so hard on the actual game. Nice and simple, very challenging at times, not too fustrating and most importantly it is actually do-able without wanting to smash the keyboard in! Good job!",
