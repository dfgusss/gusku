    "About the game": "Two Colours is a simple platformer with three, core concepts: you have to keep moving, you have to stay patient, and you can't lose your focus. Combining the traditional elements of a platformer with the idea of certain platforms ping-ponging from being safe to stand on to being dangerous to stand on, Two Colours features 20 basic levels, 20 advanced levels, 20 keys to collect, and a secret to unlock at the end of the game. As additional features unlock over the course of the game, making the game increase in difficulty as you progress, you must keep your focus. You primarily have two seconds to get onto and to get off of the red and blue platforms as they bounce back and forth from being platforms which you can stand on, and platforms which will kill you, as you try to reach the golden blocks to beat the level. Don't lose your focus, don't lose your patience. Rushing is a sure-fire way to death and frustration.",
