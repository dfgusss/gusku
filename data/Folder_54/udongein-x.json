    "About the game": "Lunarians Are Up to Something Again! A small group of Moon Rabbits has crash landed in Gensokyo. They have been left on their own! It's up to Reisen to (reluctantly) rescue each one of her former comrades and beat some sense into Lunarians once and for all. Do your best, Udon-chan! 14 Unique and Engaging Boss Fights Every Boss has a gimmick of their own and requires a different strategy! In addition to dodging bullets, you have to respect each Boss' different mechanics if you want to have a chance at winning. Make Reisen Stronger! You can invest Power Up items you get from Stages and Bosses into upgrades to make Reisen more powerful. This ranges anywhere from increasing max health to giving you the ability to erase entire screens worth of bullets in your path! Of course, you can ignore this system if you want to challenge yourself. 3 Difficulty Settings Feel like the game is too hard? You can set the difficulty to Easy if you want a more traditional platformer experience with less bullets on screen. Alternatively you can choose Lunatic for a true test of skill and patience. DISCLAIMER: You have to beat the game at least once to unlock Lunatic difficulty. Changing a difficulty setting requires a reset of your current playthrough. An Additional Mode SURVIVAL is a Boss Rush mode where you can select different perks in between fights. It will get progressively harder, so stay sharp! Who knows, maybe if you get a big enough win streak, you might unlock something interesting...",
