    "About the game": "VHSoverdose is an unrelenting assault of outlandish action, served up with thick juicy slice of anatomical annihilation! Set inside of the confides of a simple 80's Arcade Machine, VHSoverdose tells the story of a man... with a cardboard box on his head. Discover the secrets of the universe amongst the city's gritty underworld of synthetic drugs, gangs and occasional ultra-violence. Whilst trying to complete a simple task, (Collecting a suitcase). What could be so hard about that? Size up your foe, choose your killing tools and plan your strategy of attack because once the insane action starts, your biggest enemy will be the ticking clock. In the non-stop chaos, every second counts and the more enemies you tear apart, the longer your buzz lasts. Your only chance to survive is to use whatever weapons you can get your hands on and recruit some ruthless allies that are tough enough to tackle the enemy onslaught, and maybe you’ll make it through this brutal arcade terror in one piece… FEATURES: Teamwork: Recruit ruthless allies of the bathroom raptor cult to help you take down your enemies! Dynamic Timer: Every mission starts the same, you, your medicinal pipe and 30 seconds to get the case and get out. With every kill you gain time onto the clock making the preparation phase of each level as essential as the action. Twisted Arcade Gameworld: As you progress through the game watch as the fabrics of reality slowly slip away from you as you dwelve deeper and deeper into this cyber hell. Catch: Utilize your team-mates as you cycle the missions objective between each other. Throw the case to an enemy before you smash their noodles out of their head, or simply throw the case to one of your raptor buddies to get it to the exit whilst you fight off the waves of enemies that are trying to stop you from stealing their goods!",
