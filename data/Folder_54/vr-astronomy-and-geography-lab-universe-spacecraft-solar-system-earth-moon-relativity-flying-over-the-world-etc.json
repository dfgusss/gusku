    "About the game": "VR Astronomy and Geography Lab (Universe Spacecraft, Solar System, Earth, Moon, Relativity, Flying over the World, etc) This laboratory contains 4 sub-games, which will allow you to experience the magnificence of the universe, the beauty of the earth, the wonder of the moon, and the very different world you see when driving a spaceship near the speed of light under the effect of relativity. Our team comes from the Department of Physics at California Institute of Technology and Oxford University, and incorporates physical science formulas into visual effects. Lab scene 1: Space travelling within the Earth-Moon system You will find yourself in the satellite control room, and you can observe this beautiful planet in the geostationary satellite orbit. You will see the Himalayas, the American metropolitan area, the Amazon forest, and the densely changing clouds. We reconstructed the earth of the virtual world with extremely high resolution! Of course, there is the moon as well, you will experience the Apollo moon landing, personally come to the surface of the moon, see countless impact craters, and look back from the moon to our hometown, the Earth! Just swing your controllers, and you will jump up and experience the moon’s special gravity field (much lower than it is on the Earth). Take your children together maybe, to observe the earth's topography, clouds, and the night city's bright lights etc, from a totally different view; Land on the moon. Move freely. Remember, do not fall into the meteorite impact craters, because some meteor impact craters are several kilometers deep. Lab scene 2: Rover in the Solar system We are accustomed to numb life on the earth, chasing fame and fortune. When did we really calm down and look at the world we live in? Let go of your worries, drive your spaceship, travel through the solar system, and explore planets. Lab scene 3: Travelling around the world on a hot air balloon Travel in a hot air balloon, and to see the colorful world, such as: Island castles, volcanic eruptions, city ruins, eastern villages, etc. When you raise your arms(more than 1 meter above the ground),the hot air ballon will move to follow your eye sights,and you can enjoy the view while exercising your arms too. We will continue to add more places of interest and release new updates next. Please look forward to it (following will be added for free as soon as August): Stonehenge in the United Kingdom, Eiffel Tower in Paris, New York City, Maldives Seascape, Penguin Island in Antarctica, etc. Lab scene 4: Travelling in 80% light speed This is a virtual reality (VR) lab that takes you on a trip in a world with a slow speed of light. This allows for a direct experience of the theory of special relativity, much in the same spirit as in the Mr. Tompkins adventure by George Gamow (1939). We go through the different relativistic effects (e.g. length contraction, time dilation, Doppler shift, light aberration) that show up during the trip - to gain insight and sharpen the intuition on the basic concepts of special relativity.",
