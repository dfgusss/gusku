    "About the game": "This game is a decision based simulation placing you in the shoes of somebody in a crisis situation. Unlike some games, your decisions have a serious impact on the story and the events that follow. It is meant to resemble real time meaning that a no decision counts as an action, and can result in lost time or negative consequences. Put in the middle of a crisis, what would you do? The concept came to me about a year ago after being inspired by Scott Cawthon's Five Night's at Freddy's games after seeing Markiplier's videos of his reactions during gameplay, and decided to make a game of my own. I thought about the other simulators that other people have submitted, and came up with my own version and idea. I finished my first Alpha Version last year, and though the animation and sounds were not the best, I have made improvements in the backgrounds and artwork since then and now I am confident, this the best version an amateur like me could come up with for my first game creation on zero budget. With the help of two of my good friend's lending their voice talents, royalty free sound effects, and music/animation that I created myself, I made this game in its entirety using an old copy of flash. The whole project was started with absolutely no budget, and took me initially two months to make during my free time on my days off, as well as before and after work, and six months afterward improving the backgrounds and artwork. My wife and my two little black lab pups were sometimes not too pleased with me... I am very pleased with the support of the steam community to have everything greenlit and ready to go before my targeted upcoming October release date. This is my very first title which is part of a movement I'm trying to start up, 'Making Games for Charity'. (Check out my facebook group) After finishing my first title, with absolutely no budget, I soon after decided that, if I could get my first game Greenlit, I would be donating half of the proceeds to the Toronto Humane Society and the Humane Society of Durham Region. I plan on using the other half of the proceeds to have an actual working budget to create at least two new titles, (much better quality games) in which I already have the concepts in mind, in which half their proceeds will also be donated to various other charities upon their completion. Steam is a vast community in which users can sell and buy each others games which has a HUGE potential market for generating money for good causes.",
