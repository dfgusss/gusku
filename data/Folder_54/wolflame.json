    "About the game": "Brought to you by the makers of GIGANTIC ARMY, Supercharged Robot VULKAISER, and SATAZIUS, WOLFLAME is a return to the form of glorious 2D vertical shooters like Raiden, Raptor, and Twin Cobra. Story: In the year 2005 AD, the Terran colony on planet Sig Fildonia was attacked by an alien race known as the Adorians. The offensive was swift and effective. Within days, the Adorians had destroyed the TDF fleet stationed in orbit, and commandeered the colony facilities, rapidly transforming the planet surface into a sprawling military base. With support ships sent from Earth unable to penetrate the Andorian blockade, the sparse TDF forces that remain on-planet must rally to counter the enemy invasion. They name their desperate resistance “Operation WOLFLAME'. Your experimental Plinius class corvette, the 'Siebold', is equipped with a forward-facing cannon, burst effect plasma field, two satellite attack drones stationed at the starboard and port of the craft. The satellites can be individually configured and support numerous tactical configurations. Ready your reflexes! High speed enemy fire incoming! Features: ★ 10 stages of vertical shooting action! ★ Signature ASTRO PORT giant bosses to take down! ★ 4 difficulty levels from Easy to Insane! ★ Forward shot, plasma bombs, triple threat attack satellites! ★ Alien fighter drones, multi-legged tanks, transforming bosses, oh my! ★ TATE mode support! ★ 36 achievements to conquer! ★ Steam trading cards to collect!",
