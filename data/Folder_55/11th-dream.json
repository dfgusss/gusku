    "About the game": "Visit a place after biological history where machines have become tools for other tools. 11th Dream is a fast abstract third person shooter. It is based on high difficulties requiring inhuman concentration. It targets fans of hard-core game genres and speedrunners. At the beginning of the match, players choose from three basic and three additional specializations. The resulting mix affects the style of play - speed, damage and endurance of the character. Players compete for blue crystals from destroyed bots. By collecting crystals, specialization increases exponentially. In addition to synchronous multiplayer and asynchronous Daily mode, the game offers a story campaign speculating about the future, in which artificial intelligence overcomes human history. To bring vapor of dream gaming to your screen, we are going through rather bizarre development flow using our own custom engine. Absence of accessible technology supports our imagination, breaking visuals and also drives us to create new artistic approaches to fast 3D shooter genre.
