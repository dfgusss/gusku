    "About the game": "After passing out in the woods near your camping site you hear a loud rumbling and the sound of falling rocks. Returning to your tent you see it has been crushed. In 7th Chance you will explore a twisted version of our own reality where you are confronted with the demons of your past and present. The game is a linear story-based game designed to be played in one sitting and will take 15mins (one ending) to 30mins (complete story + achievements). Each choice should not be taken lightly, as they will affect the outcome and if the world decides to offer punishment or salvation. Hey, I'm Andrew from DrewidGames. After years of working on projects far too big that went nowhere, I decided to focus my efforts on making a solo indie adventure game. I hope you enjoy it!",
