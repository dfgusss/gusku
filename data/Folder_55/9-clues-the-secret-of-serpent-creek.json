This thrilling mystery merges elements of classical horror and gritty, 50’s-style noir. A paranormal private investigator is contacted by her friend, famous reporter Helen Hunter, whose voice sounds small and terrified in the voicemail. She is in the coastal town of Serpent Creek, and needs help immediately. But upon arriving in Serpent Creek, the detective finds no trace of Ms. Hunter. Weirder still is the fact the town’s streets are crawling with snakes, and the citizens seem to be sleepwalking through life. The ground shakes with violent tremors. When investigating Serpent Creek, the detective will perform true investigative work: finding clues and combining them to learn the secrets of every crime scene in the all new Detective Mode! Features Unique Detective Mode gameplay Eerie, realistic settings Mysterious crime story set in 1950’s America Challenging mini-games Complex characters with real motivations Detective’s Journal that includes current tasks and character index Unique locations Breathtaking plot full of unexpected twists",
