    "About the game": "Introduction Chance and destiny find themselves intermeshed in A Game of Changes . Unravel and decipher the mechanics of these worlds, and journey through the 64 unique puzzles that draw inspiration and teachings from the I Ching [Book of Changes], one of the oldest classic books in human history. Its wisdom originates from philosophical and scientific observations of the laws which rule existence. It invites us to conscientiously look within, at one’s own personality, character, perspective and purpose while inspiring us to discover the one unspoken, unmanifest, unchanging truth. There is no predefined way, no set progression, no rights or wrongs, it's all about the choices you make. Gameplay Using the keyboard or a gamepad, you control the wise sage Confucius. In each level, your purpose is to open and reach the door, which will lead you to a different level. As you discover the mechanics behind each element and symbol in the tiles, you are able to manipulate their position, in order to reach the door. In each level, you'll be able to select the next level's hexagram, so when you cross the door, that's the level you'll be playing next. The final purpose is to visit and complete all 64 levels. More than just 64 puzzles, the entire game is one big puzzle.",
