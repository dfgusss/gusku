    "About the game": "AdventureClimbVR (#ACVR) is a room-scale climbing experience for anyone of any age. Achieve triumph by getting to the top in as quick a time as possible. Designed by actual rock climbers, designed to thrill, and offers the views that typically are only offered to the very few brave enough to climb to ridiculous heights. Race to the top, beat your friend's time, explore the various Easter Eggs, avoid the hazards, and find SECRET Locations... the choice of how you play is up to you! The Background As climbers, we originally built this game to explore different locomotion ways that we felt were lacking in other VR climbing experiences. After trialing at a real climbing competition, we decided to push a free demo one-level version on Steam in 2019. After much great feedback, we decided in July 2022 to build a v2 that incorporates your requests for enhancements, new levels, and extra features, welcome to our DLC. Don't worry, we've kept the first level free, but now you have the option to upgrade to our DLC and play 5 additional levels. / If you enjoy the experience let us know by using #ACVR on socials, commenting below, or emailing us at ACVR@MXTreality.com .
