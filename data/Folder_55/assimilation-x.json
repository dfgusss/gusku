Descend down the various levels of the simulation, all the way to the subatomic state, as it gets increasingly mind-bending and twisted beyond reason in order to end this synthetic cruel universe and end the suffering of millions. Stunning Neon-Inspired Level Design. Beautifully designed levels inspired by the neon '80s will trickle away as you descend deeper into the darker twisted levels of the simulation. The fabric of reality will devolve around you. Massive Amounts of Russian Hard Bass The souls of countless Russians in the simulation fuel the hard bass of this synthetic universe. Use The Simulation To Your Advantage. Run, Jump, &amp; Parkour your way through every level as you speed-run the simulation or move controlled &amp; carefully taking in everything as you go while you solve puzzles. A Narrated Story To Grasp Your Attention. A carefully written story narrated by the simulation A.I. caretaker ILA, among others, who will take vasts amount of pleasure in taunting and teasing you as you journey through the simulation. However, her intentions may not be as clear as they seem. A Lore Filled World. Deviating from the seemingly obvious path will be rewarded with characters, recordings, and more all teeming with rich lore and interesting stories that complement the overall narrative beautifully.",
