    "About the game": "It's that time and season again when the absolute test of marksmanship is on display again. It's a contest of skill, it's a contest of the ability to target and take out targets. It's Balloon Fiesta 3D time again. You are armed with a simple dart gun in this fun contest. You will be situated in several fiestas, stages where balloons rise from holes in the floor. You'll have to be vigilant, read the hints, watch the signs if you want to survive this contest. The simple rule here, blast away any balloons you see, make sure none of them floats beyond your reach to the ceiling. Sounds easy right? Except in some fiestas, there are holes all around you and you will have to swing around a lot to shoot balloons. In other fiestas, you have rotating floors and targeting is going to be very difficult. And in some fiestas, balloons are coming from holes located even further away from your position, targeting is going to be quite difficult. Take this hint to survive in this title, try to shoot balloons as they emanate from their holes. Do not focus on just a hole and the balloons proceeding from it. If you do that, other holes will produce balloons that will float beyond your reach before you are aware. Balloon Fiesta 3D is another lightweight title running with minimum memory and hard disk requirements making it suitable for lightweight PCs. It is also designed to be suitable for all ages.",
