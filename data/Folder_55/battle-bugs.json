    "About the game": "Control stink bugs, cockroaches, lightning bugs, ants and more. They are all part of your 22 bug army. Each has its own mobility, strength and weapon characteristics. Use classic military strategy as your insectile troops fight enemy bugs over a kitchen floor strewn with junk food! Fight for dominance, against the clock, or sometimes just to survive. 56 battles, each more complex and challenging, and all with the kind of tongue-in-cheek humour that will keep you buzzing with laughter! Features Use sophisticated strategies based on real military tactics. Simple to learn, but hard to master. 22 different bugs to battle, from ants to flies to bees to stink bugs, all with their own unique strengths, weaknesses and abilities. Unusual pause-to-plan real-time strategy gameplay. Carefully choose your moves, then un-pause time to let the action play out - pausing again at any time to re-issue orders. Humorous military briefings, victory celebrations, funny parodies, and puns. So many puns. Charming animations and high-resolution (for 1994) VGA colour graphics. Single player and two-player modes. Battle Bugs was created in 1994 by Epyx Inc., and designed primarily by Dennis Caswell, legendary creator of such classics as Impossible Mission and Pitstop II .",
