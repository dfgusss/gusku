    "Release date": "Feb 14, 2018",
    "About the game": "Beer! is a collection of frantic minigames where you have only twelve seconds to grab the beer! But it's not just about your reflexes: each screen is a puzzle that may take you numerous tries to figure out. Easy to pick up and difficult to master, this game rewards quick and out-of-the-box thinking. It comes with a cheerful cafe-style soundtrack, and assorted cast of bears and deer. The game includes three sets of ten levels, a secret bonus round, and several cameos. Suitable for all ages; alcohol not included. 'The concept was brilliant: seemingly mindless speed-click game that actually really makes you think about how to solve each puzzle.' 'It's a fun time waster and casual enough to pick it up for a short round (pun intentional).'",
