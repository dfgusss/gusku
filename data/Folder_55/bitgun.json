    "About the game": "BITGUN is a top-down action roguelite with lots of blood and guns. Go on missions and kill hordes of zombies. Guns break quickly, make sure you bring enough ... but not too many because if you die, you'll lose everything. Dodge zombies jumping at you or crawling out of the ground and fight your way towards the zombie boss. Every enemy you encounter is ready to kill you in just a few seconds. Very difficult and satisfying combat you can learn and master! Hordes of zombies to kill - regular zombies, slow zombies, ranged zombies, exploding zombies, zombie spiders, zombie bosses, you name it! A LOT of blood everywhere! Are you lost? Just follow your blood trail! Guns to loot, guns to upgrade, guns to repair! Punishing and challenging gameplay - you lose all your gear when you die, guns have limited durability and break often. Random stats for weapons and enemies. Jumpy AI. Retro hand drawn pixel-art look with cutscenes and comics. 9 regular missions. 2 special missions. Several quests. Steam achievements. Chat with the developer!",
