    "About the game": "In this classic point-and-click adventure anthology you follow the path of Dale Vandermeer, a homicide detective, as he investigates the death of a woman and finds himself drawn into the mysterious world of Rusty Lake. Cube Escape was Rusty Lake's first series of games, introducing the Rusty Lake universe. Heavily inspired by TV series Twin Peaks. All games will be updated, preserved and bundled on Steam for a small price, to survive the end of the Flash Games era. The Cube Escape Collection will contain 9 chapters: Seasons, The Lake, Arles, Harvey's Box, Case 23, The Mill, Birthday, Theatre and The Cave. Thanks for your support! PLEASE NOTE: These games do not contain any new content from their original versions (besides achievements, a new hint system and translations)!",
