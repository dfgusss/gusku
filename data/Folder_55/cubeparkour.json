    "About the game": "Hello there! CubeParkour is a simple and easy to understand game. You are a cube and your mission is to get to the goal that is on a specific location in the level. Each of the 100 levels have some special quirks to them, but the way you can best them is not defined except from physics (gravity for the most part). Some levels can be very demanding. Patience, tenacity and luck are imperative, almost like real life. From my experience with the game: If you get to the goal after 150 attempts. Even if it was pure luck. Uuuuuuh - that feeling. You can color your cube, if you want to. We will donate 20% of our earnings to nature preserving projects - We are also on patreon, if you deem our cause worthy. And that's it. Things you will not find: Character development Hobbits Intricate, thrilling and gut wrenching story Penguins K/D/A Loot Guns The one ring Super heroes Things you will find: A cube Rumble tube Rubber &amp; Ice Darkness Floaty zones Instant gratification The floor is lava Character development",
