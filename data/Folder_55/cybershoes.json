    "About the game": "Cybershoes Let You Walk Your VR Adventure. This is the driver for Cybershoes. It includes a dashboard as well. Cybershoes are a popular foot controller for FPS, open-world, adventure, riddle, and social games. The Cybershoes are strapped directly onto your feet, and as you are seated in a swivel bar stool, you’re ready to begin your VR adventure. The Cybershoes are compatible with many VR games (e.g. Boneworks, No Man's Sky, Skyrim, DOOM, Arizona Sunshine, Fallout, Onward, Pavlov, RecRoom, VRChat ), and function with SteamVR, the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, the Quest via Oculus Link, Virtual Desktop and Oculus store games, Windows Mixed Reality, and Pimax. With the Cybershoes at your feet, all of your moments are controlled by your own physical movement, so you can walk your VR adventure as if you were actually there. The Cybershoes benefits and features include: Advanced Immersion Through Natural Movement – The Cybershoes are able to immerse players in the experience by letting them control their in-game movement by actually walking in place, the player actually feels as if they are their in-game character. Accurate Directional Tracking -- The player’s vision is independent of the walking direction of the Cybershoes, meaning you can fully observe your surroundings while you walk, duck or bend to pick up objects thanks to highly accurate motion trackers in Cybershoes. Activity Tracking – Users can now track their physical activity while using the Cybershoes and determine the distance of their virtual journeys. Reduces motion sickness : While the users’ legs are moving and their head is bouncing in movement that resembles real walking, Cybershoes can significantly reduce motion sickness.",
