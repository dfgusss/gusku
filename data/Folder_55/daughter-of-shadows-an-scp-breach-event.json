    "Release date": "Apr 4, 2016",
    "About the game": "The player assumes the role of a dangerous and powerful girl known as SCP-029. After a facility wide power outage occurs, numerous SCPs breach containment and proceed to wreak havoc throughout the facility. SCP-029 must use her mind-controlling powers to survive and find a way to escape from the facility. We wanted to incorporate some of the SCP favorites like SCP-173 and SCP-106. To that end we opted to set 'Daughter of Shadows' in the same facility as 'SCP: Containment Breach.' Beyond the physical location of the facility and a few SCPs, 'Daughter of Shadows' is designed to be an entirely new experience. Most of the emphasis is on the introduction and discovery of new SCPs. Survive and escape the randomly generated and labyrinthine SCP facility Experience the power of a mind-controlling Keter class SCP and force men to do your bidding Revisit some old “friends” like SCP-173 and SCP-106, and make some new ones Experience more of the SCP universe with a total of 25 unique SCPs Unlimited replayability with different SCPs and layouts in each playthrough Unlock 48 different achievements of varying difficulty Additional SCPs and features may be made available via DLC",
