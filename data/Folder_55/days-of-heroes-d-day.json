    "About the game": "It’s the beginning of June 1944. Five years since the start of World War II, the Third Reich continues their occupation of Europe. Allied forces decide to open a so-called “second front” in Western Europe to turn the tides of war. Operation Overlord – the biggest landing operation in history – is about to start. General Eisenhower sets June 6th as D-Day. Joint forces of American, British, and Canadian troops get ready to land on the Normandy coast. You are among the soldiers about to change the fate of the world. From two unique perspectives, experience the largest landing operation in martial history regarding the forces and means used. Take on the role of an airborne division jumper who descends into enemy territory to destabilize the enemy troops under the cover of night. Alternately, become a soldier beginning their heavy crossing of Omaha beach on D-Day. Complete diversified military missions, from short- and long-range skirmishes with Nazis, by employing anti-aircraft fire, destroying enemy tanks, and breaking through the trenches and escaping from a POW camp. Use over a dozen weapons typical to the World War II period that have been accurately reproduced in terms of appearance and mechanics. Finish the campaign and practice your skills on the shooting range, which offers four different gameplay modes. Once ready, unlock Hardcore Mode, which will take your cleverness, strategic thinking, and will to survive to the extreme. Become a Hero!",
