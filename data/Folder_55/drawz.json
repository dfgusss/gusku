    "About the game": "As a digitalized version of the chalk and black chalkboard that we knew from our old school years, Drawz is an oldskool puzzle game with 45 levels! The simple menu and level screens in the game have made great efforts to feel us like the shapes we draw on the blackboard. On each level you will find the number of balls and blocks changing. In these areas, you will have to score by filling in the drawing areas that vary according to the difficulty level with your own hand drawing. Increasing difficulty at every level you progress is also suitable for younger teens. Drawz can also be played on touch screens. Developer’s note: I’ll be happy to share your ideas about Drawz and also waiting your feedbacks. Have a good games!",
