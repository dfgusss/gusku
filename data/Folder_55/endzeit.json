    "About the game": "Endzeit is an action survival shooter, with a focus on immersion, gunplay and freedom. Players have to cleanse the game world of hundreds of roaming robots (sleepers) while fighting together or against each other. Story: A military project called the 'Super Trooper' was meant to accelerate the outcome of the war and save millions of soldier's lives. They where humanoid fighting robots designed to be cheaply produced in masses, with thick armor plates, a self destructive explosive charge and capable of carrying heavy weapons and ammunitions. After years of massive losses on the enemy side they started to deploy radar trailers in an attempt to disturb the robots communication systems. Being cut off from the master computer, the Super Troopers entered a fail safe state, waiting in place to receive new orders while attacking anything that came too close, not able to distinguish between friend, foe or civilian. Key Features: -Satisfying gunplay -Minimal HUD -Vehicles -Variety of different weapons and tools",
