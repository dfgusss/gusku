    "About the game": "The battle was lost ages ago and now the barren ruins hold nothing but echoes of once great civilization. Amidst the dust, few that remain are still clinging to their existence, far beyond the point where they could be called human. But the hope still lingers. On the outskirts of the forgotten city, a lone soul awakens from millennial slumber. Lost and forgotten, he finds himself in catacombs and now his way lies through the treacherous ruins to the very heart of it. Enoch – Underground is a hardcore action-RPG title set in an ancient city destroyed long time ago. The player takes control of the awakened – one of the few survivors left in the city. Without a goal and without memories he starts his way through the ruins striving to find his place in this hostile world. The gameplay is based on classic action RPGs with such features as complex environments, precise battle system, and generous loot, but makes accessibility a staple of game’s design. The character progression is entirely loot-based, eliminating the need for complex character menus while retaining flexibility and customization options. Each weapon type has unique stats and attack patterns, armor can provide additional protection and sometimes valuable buffs, trinkets and mutagens allow to change character’s abilities, providing an advantage in combat. Encounters require patience and precision but give just enough room for error to get familiar with enemy’s attack patterns and develop a strategy to withstand them. The game is balanced to be hard but fair so that completing the playthrough gives the sense of achievement while the process of doing so does not feel like a chore. Different weapon types, each with unique attack patterns Powerful artifacts that boost player stats or provide new skills Varied environments and enemies Precise, dynamic combat system Deadly environmental traps that you can turn to your advantage Devastating special attacks and skills",
