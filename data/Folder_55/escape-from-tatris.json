    "About the game": "The game was made for parody purposes, we did not pursue the goal of offending anyone or stealing intellectual property. A classic puzzle game inspired by many shooters. You have to put the loot found by the PMC into your backpack as quickly as possible, until you run out of space. The game develops trash collection skills in other games without the risk of losing your 'treasures'. Indescribable atmosphere of fighting and looting. In the game, you can endlessly collect trash without the risk of losing everything or filling up a place in the cache. It's a pity there is no open world. From the development team who made 0 projects included in the release. Unfortunately, there is no juice in our game, but you can just pause the game (innovative innovation) and drink it yourself. The game does not contain mechanics that allow you to spend money in order not to play. In case you are not immediately answered in support of Escape From Tatris, perhaps they are going to eat. If you find bugs in the game, remember, the game is under development. Collect the most points, set records and have fun in Escape from Tatris! Please do not buy our game.",
