Therefore, the game consists of 9 huge areas, each representing one circle of hell. In each area the player has to find a certain number of soul crystals in order to open the portal to the next level and to advance one circle. The game is a uniquely stylized 3d first-person platformer and plays around with the concept of live and death. Each circle consists of 5 different platforming challenges and surprises with breathtaking environments, a surreal world full of beauty, grace and despair, and a couple of small environmental puzzles that blend perfectly into the peaceful yet stunning environments. Will you be able to escape hell? Find it out. Here are some of the features of the game: Fast-paced parkour action An interesting background story 9 unique worlds with 5 challenges Countless traps and difficult jumps Hidden paths and secret achievements The feeling of smooth and fast speed while bouncing through levels Awesome soundtrack",
