You have to press the key to complete the sound. The base game includes over 250 songs, the biggest in terms of volume in the franchise history. From old-time classics to unconventional twists on the existing genre, EZ2ON covers a broad range of musical tastes. ◆ Rhythm-action for everyone EZ2ON is designed to be an accessible rhythm-action game to the core. Anyone can easily adapt, groove to the music, and enjoy the gameplay. Why not give it a shot? Intuitive yet diverse styles of four key modes, 4K · 5K · 6K · 8K, are available. And each key mode provides four different difficulties per song, assisting the players in improving their skills. Does this kind of game feel a bit overwhelming? Or, are you familiar with other rhythm-action games? Start with 'BASIC' mode that everyone can enjoy without being stressed out. Do you want to know how skillful you are? Do you enjoy a more competitive experience? 'STANDARD' mode has much more strict timing requirements. On top of that, your skill is evaluated via Rating system. 'COURSE' mode is also available where you can play a sequence of songs non-stop. Each course is carefully curated and designed by the devs. ◆ Looking for some 'EZ2'? Glad you're in the right place.
