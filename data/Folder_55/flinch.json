You're racing against time and trying to keep your cool. Flinch monitors your behaviors and can detect when you jerk or move suddenly if you get frightened. Eeek! A second player or party can use the keyboard to try to scare the in-game player. Something evil is lurking waiting to strike!!! Monsters will attempt to attack you, but light is you friend. Keep them at bay using torches and lighting candles. Navigate a maze of suspense and last as long as you can! Most importantly, don't flinch!",
