    "About the game": "Fun Machine - A Fruit Machine Simulator from Robot Plums. Each play gives you 50 Credits to score as much as possible, and get to the top of the High Score Table. Just like a real Fruit Machine , you win by lining up 3 of the same symbols on the win-line (from 3 points for 3 cherries, to 50 points for 3 treasure chests. You can also score 2 points for lining up just 2 of the same symbols on reels 1 and 2. Scattered across the 3 reels are 3 different types of Jewel. As these land on the win-line, they help light up the trail (Red = 1 light, Yellow = 2, Green = 3), but the Feature Trail isn't always held between spins. You need to light up all the 'Fun Machine' letters using the Jewels to gain access to the Feature Board . Once you get to the Feature Board, you randomly choose a Feature from the many on the Board, although there are some not-so-good Features on there too, including 'LOSE' in the centre of the Board. Fingers crossed! Once you've chosen a Feature, and presuming you haven't selected one of the bad ones, you will play one of the many games of Skill or Chance, all of which vary in how many goes/spins/turns you get, and how many points are up for grabs. Fun Machine also features regulars like Nudge Pot and Cash Pot , which not only carry over to the next game, but are saved so that they are there the next time you play the game. With these Pots, selecting the Cash Pot from the Feature Board will add whatever is in the Cash Pot to your score, and selecting the Nudge Pot will start the Nudge Feature, where you will be able to nudge the reels down one at a time, until you either run out of nudges, or achieve a win on the win-line. Be careful when nudging, because even with many nudges in the Nudge Pot, it's easy to lose concentration while trying to get the 3 Treasure Chests for the Jackpot, and end up winning 2 points for getting the same symbols on Reels 1 and 2 (Been there, done that!). At the end of your 50 Credits (although you may have had more than 50 credits because Extra Credits are available on the Feature Board), if you have a good enough score, you will be able to enter your name and see your name in lights on the High Score Table. Get the top spot, and earn bragging rights with your friends and family.",
