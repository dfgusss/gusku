    "About the game": "Come celebrate Camp Chuckerwood's 100th year! It's Midsummer Night's Dream meets Friday the 13th, as you work as a camp counselor for the the bloodthirsty, training them to become the next generation of horror icons! The world needs these creatures of the night in order to keep the magic and imagination of the world alive, which is odd, considering these are all slashers and other types of movie monsters. As Bray the Manticore, you enter Camp Chuckerwood, located on the edges of Lake Quiet Waters, wide eyed and ready to change the lives of your campers. What you get is two Fae Lords in the middle of a break-up, a Sasquatch intent on revenge, a giant wasp doing community service, and a werewolf head counselor at the end of her rope. Also, there's another, different werewolf at the end of her rope as well, but we don't want to spoil the entire game for you. Interact with eight fellow summer counselors and up to four budding legends of horror! Survive the summer play, the summer sportsball game, the typical summer camp horror/slasher experience, and summer rivalries! Fun is mandatory. Survival is not.",
