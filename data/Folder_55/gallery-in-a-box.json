    "About the game": "I created a catalogue of 5 artists, by guiding the player through a virtual art gallery. During the experience each work of art is enhanced in some way, but without altering its identity. The experience is about 5 minutes long and is best experienced seated or standing with the audio turned up! *************WHEN YOU RUN IT PRESS THE SPACE BAR TO CALIBRATE YOUR POSITION************* ****To close press ALT+F4**** The artists: 1. Rachel Ara 2. Jacek Ludwig Scarso 3. Ian Chamberlin 4. Nemo Nonnenmacher 5. Scarlet Mueller Let me know what you think! Cheers, Felix",
