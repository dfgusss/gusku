    "About the game": "Tower of Magic is kind of a childhood memory for post-90s/00s, I guess, my earliest exposure to the game was Tower of Mordor, that's why I want to make a Tower of Magic game Adding the now popular Roguelike element, adding randomness to each area based on the reasonably planned route of the Magic Tower game, so what does certainty plus uncertainty equal? ⭐ Five regions, over 150 maps, experience hundreds of gear &amp; skill combinations Plan your route through the area, defeat enemies as harmlessly as possible, defeat the boss, move on to the next area, and pick the area rewards Use different equipment skill sets to defeat different enemies depending on their characteristics! Occasionally, we come across the odd map After passing the level, you can challenge the high difficulty dungeon, the road to become a big man of the Magic Tower ⭐ Eight characters, eleven professions Enjoy the Assassin Attack Stream, Knight Defense Stream, Wizard Spell Stream, Sacrifice Stream, Attack Speed Stream, and many other superb ways to play! Black out the character and experience the character's great power as well as control the great power side effects ⭐Multiple DLCs available during the course of the game Turn on skill tree mode Embark on an endless journey Open the Volcano/Sky City map ...... Start enjoying a trip to the Magic Tower dungeon! Benefits of Steam version vs. Android version. ①6000 souls ②200% in-game soul acquisition ③ Steam Ring [Ex] ④ The Demon King's Treasure DLC direct access",
