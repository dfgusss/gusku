    "Release date": "May 24, 2016",
    "About the game": "The horde of drones has invaded earth. They are taking over cities and factories to use for their own self-replication. Play as Joe or Gem and rise up to fight the horde. This is an 8-bit style platformer comprised of eleven levels. Nine in the campaign and two unlockable levels. The gameplay is meant to be fast and challenging with a focus on destroying the enemy units (drones and tanks). You will have to fight a more challenging boss at the end of each level in the campaign. There are two weapons at Joe and Gem's disposal, a briefcase for bashing, and they can turn any mobile into a weapon which remotely destroys the drones. Each item you are holding = 1 HP so if you have a briefcase and mobile, you can get hit two times before dying. If you get hit once, you lose the mobile, get hit again and lose the briefcase, get hit one more time and you're dead. Genesis of Drones was inspired by the games I grew up on. I hope you will enjoy it!",
