    "About the game": "Isotiles 2 is an isometric puzzle game and the sequel to Isotiles. Like the first game, the main goal of each level is to remove all the blue tiles and then get to the exit tile. The game features all new levels and some new tile types as well for more interesting puzzles. In addition, there is an explorable level map where you enter each level from, and there will also be locks that open up when a certain number of levels are completed. Like the first game, you won't have to complete every level to get to the later ones. The game can be played fully with the mouse, but there are also optional keyboard commands. Move -- WASD or arrow keys Reset -- R Undo -- Z To menu or exit -- Esc",
