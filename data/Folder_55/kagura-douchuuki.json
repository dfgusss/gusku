    "About the game": "We are currently planning an English release of Kagura Douchuuki! Kagura Douchuuki is a roguelike RPG where you control shrine maidens (miko) and battle against monsters. Dungeons are randomly generated, so the map layout, enemies, and items will be completely different with each play-through! Every time your character enters the dungeon, their level will be reset back to level 1*. You must venture further into the depths of the dungeon to gain more useful and powerful items needed to complete your quest! Beautiful and charming characters, five different maps, and a final, ultimate dungeon awaits players in the wonderful tale of Kagura Douchuuki! * In easy mode, the character's level will not be reset.",
