    "About the game": "A visual novel from the talented doujin circle, Canvas+Garden featuring their mascot characters who come to life in this youthful story! Spring break at the school academy. It is a season filled with both expectation and hesitation as I enter my new life as a student at a new school. I, Ogisawa Asaki, have just moved from the quaint surroundings of my hometown to a new place: the town of Hanao Usaka. My new home is my grandmother’s house that also functions as a café. Due to my grandmother’s recent illness and hospitalization, however, she was forced to close the café until further notice. When I heard about my grandmother’s situation from Chisato Komada (a childhood friend who is like an older sister to me), I looked around the desolate café and my heart was filled with a sense of loneliness. It was then I immediately thought: “I want to bring the shop back to life again and show it to grandmother…!!!” We renovated the inside of the shop and gave it a new name. We prepared a new menu and café uniforms and began the hiring process to find new, part-time staff. Right away two girls, Niwasaka Rira and Shionomiya Richer came into the cafe. “Um… would it be ok if we worked here?” An unusually strong breeze blew cherry blossom petals inside the shop and they fluttered and danced around the cafe, myself, and the girls around me. This could only be a premonition of the bittersweet tale that would soon follow… Fully voiced in Japanese (except main character) English, Japanese, and Chinese Language Support CG Gallery Music Gallery Character Designs by Miyasaka Miyu and Miyasaka Nako Two Routes",
