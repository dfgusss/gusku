    "About the game": "MOTHER is a first-person psychological horror game about protecting your children while descending deeper &amp; deeper into madness. You play as Mary, who has just recently lost her husband, and needs to take care of her two children by herself. Suffering from insomnia, you wake up each night and experience strange events. Soon enough you'll find that there are some secrets you can't escape from. Defend your children at all costs. Be careful, because their death is permanent! GAMEPLAY DESCRIPTION Each night, you must go to sleep in order to progress. However, you can't sleep until your daily tasks are finished and your children are asleep. The objective is to survive without letting your children die. Your main actions will be using a phone, using a gun, and interacting with objects in your environment. The game is played with mouse and keyboard, and is published for Windows. It takes around 3 hours to finish. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This is a passion project of mine that I've developed in my personal time while I was studying. Comments, feedback and reviews are greatly appreciated!",
