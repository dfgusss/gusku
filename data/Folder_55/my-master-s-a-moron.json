    "About the game": "'My Master's A Moron' is a 2D turn-based, tile-based roguelike &amp; roguelite dungeon crawler. Explore your way through your Master's basement (that he happens to rent out to monsters) and discover a multitude of enemies, items, spells, armor, upgrades, and more. Explore 3 unique dungeon types. Fight with countless different enemies with their own unique abilities. Try to kill your Master! Increase your power with a variety of permanent upgrades in your home base. Fight 3 bosses each with fun and unique mechanics. Meet interesting characters throughout your gameplay and unlock more upgrades in your base. Try to kill your Master again and again... and again! Collect different items with different utility abilities. Teleport around, shield yourself, swap places with an enemy, put down bear traps, and more. Cast a range of cool spells from calling down meteors of fire, to smiting your enemies to heal you when you hit them. Stack armor up with different stats. Who says you can't wear 10 different helms? All the cool people do! Eat food! Everybody likes food. Underestimate how moronic your Master is... by trying to sabotage him at every point. Strategically use everything you've found in a fun &amp; fast-paced turn-based movement &amp; combat system! Enjoy the sarcastic and murderous dialogues! Be free? Won't you help this tired, grumpy Djinn earn his freedom by getting his Master killed?!",
