    "About the game": "High school is a wild ride. A cesspool of body image and toxicity. A rancid petri dish of raging hormones left unattended and sprouting fungal infections that use the word 'gay' as an insult. And you just started your first day of Freshman year. My Story is a difficult precision platformer with a strong emphasis on narrative, so strong that it's embedded into the blocks you jump on. Jump and dash through friendship, trust, betrayal, and a mildly concerning amount of caffeine. Content Warning: My Story contains themes of suicide, mental illness, and cringey dialogue",
