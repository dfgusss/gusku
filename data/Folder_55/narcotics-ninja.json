    "About the game": "Narcotics Ninja is a fast paced action platformer with an emphasis on physics based platforming and high intensity combat. Traverse a variety of levels set in a cyberpunk style environment in which the player takes on the role of a drug runner, who must navigate their way through rival territories and deal with law enforcement. Once you take on the role of the Runner, you will gain access to his toolkit - A minigun, a tool for both dispatching enemies from a distance and navigating your way through the levels; A katana, an effective weapon at close range for instantly destroying most types of enemies; and the shurikens, a throwable weapon for taking enemies out at range. On top of all of this, the player will be able to use the Overdrive ability when enough enemies have been destroyed, which slows the passage of time and grants explosive ammunition to the minigun for a short while.",
