    "About the game": "Presentation Deep enough for the veteran roleplayer... Humorous enough for the casual gamer! OH! RPG! is a quirky, innovative and colorful adventure by RosePortal Games (of Epic Quest and Whisper of a Rose fame) and released on Steam by RPG veteran Aldorlea Games . The game consists of 8 chapters, each with a different atmosphere, gameplay and protagonist, all contributing to an exciting and fresh experience. Mixing elements of parody and great use of interaction with an enthralling storyline, this game is a quality blend of pure RPG goodness - but with an unique twist! Plot Heroes always win. But what happens to those who don't? The world is coming to an end and the heroes return home after their ludicrous failure, to be with loved ones for whatever's left. Except this time you're not going to play them. Who wants to play failures anyway? In OH! RPG!, traditional roles are reversed. You play the NPCs and help the heroes along the way. See the story from another perspective and embark with a new protagonist in each of the 8 chapters Travel from front to back, from awe-inspiring castles to your remote peasant village, from enemies super strong and big, to end up proudly defeating... pathetic slimes? Enjoy a collection of unique protagonists such as an upbeat Jester, a quickwitted Goblin or even the Hero's own family, as you interact with them in an innovative way Visit 8 chapters, all with a different style and optional content to discover! Features Unique battles using the special skill 'Hero Calls': Harold, Therese, Marsha and Lucius are never in battle, but you can call them and wait until they arrive, and they will perform one powerful move - this is different for each battle depending on where they are in the story End-level ratings based on performance Stage selection to replay levels and improve your ratings in each Global User Rank based on overall end-level results - unlock goodies with higher scores!
