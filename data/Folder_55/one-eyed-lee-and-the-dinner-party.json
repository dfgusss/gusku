    "About the game": "ABOUT THE GAME: Beracus and Lee finally have a lead to more information about a potential cure for Beracus' suffering village. Upon finding the entrance to an apparently abandoned bunker, the two become trapped inside and discover the place is inhabited by a family of hospitable cult members, who also happen to be skeletons. The family mistakes the two for fellow members, and invites them to 'stay for the party' and wait for the 'New World'. Unfortunately, Lee and Beracus don't have that kind of time! They'll similarly meet their deaths down there if they don't escape, and they still have to find their all important cure! Together they must explore and talk to the skeleton family to discover clues, collect items, and try to unravel the tragedies that turned this simple bunker into a tomb. GAME FEATURES: -Point and click your way through a mysterious bunker! -Uncover the horrifying events that happened there... -Meet and greet a family of skeletons and decide if they are friend, or foe! -Get to know, guide, and ultimately judge, your pal One-Eyed Lee! -Casual, easy to pick up puzzles -8 different endings! -3-4 hours for each complete playthrough -Completely original art, story, and soundtrack -Available for Windows, Linux, and Steam OS ABOUT THE CREATOR: DarkChibiShadow finally makes their Steam debut!
