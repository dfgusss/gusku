A dangerous biochemical has been released into the ecosystem, turning every living thing into a bloodthirsty killer. You are holed up in your apartment; for all you know you are the last survivor but your food and water supplies are running low. It's time to take your chance and make your move. You must use your wits and your brain to avoid dangers, solve puzzles, find your girlfriend - if she is still alive - and escape the broken city... Search for items and use them in different scenes. Fight infected zombies to stay alive. Point and click to find objects. Multiple endings Full soundtrack written by David.F.Burrows. Every action you take will have it's consequences. Be aware of trigger effects. Exciting storyline that will keep you searching for the truth. 25th June, 2012 Dear Jenny, I don't know where you are but write you this letter in the hope that you might return home. Water and food supplies are running low and I have to leave Riverlake. I haven't slept in what seems like ages - I try and shut my eyes but I keep hearing strange noises outside. The streets echo with desperate screams and it's too dangerous to be out for long. There are crazy people running around, attacking anyone in sight - it's like they are infected with some sort of virus. I watched one of them stand up not long after he was shot multiple times in the chest. It's surely only a matter of time before the infected come bursting through the door here. None of it makes any sense. I don’t know how this all happened but I do know that I'm not safe here. Where is the military? Are they even around any more? I don't know what's going on and in the city I am totally alone. I am certain you are still out there somewhere, I can feel it. I want you to know that I will wait for you... Do not think that I am leaving you - you are and always will be with me and my love for you will be forever. If you read this I will have made my way out of here. I will wait for you at the gas station just a few miles out of town. I hope I can be there tomorrow evening and I will wait for a week. If you do not show up I will be heading north, to try and find someone - anyone - who might have survived this. Forever yours.
