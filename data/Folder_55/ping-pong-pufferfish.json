    "About the game": "Go through many challenging levels to show everyone your agility and strategic thinking. In order to complete the level, you will need to get into the glass jar with the help of a small cannon. Try to use fewer balls to get a high score. Create your own ways to get into the jar, as the levels can be completed in different ways! HISTORY: The idea for Ping Pong Pufferfish has its origins in Taiwan, where there is one exciting merchant game in the night markets. Passers-by are invited to hit a glass jar with a rubber ball in order to receive winning prizes. But due to the elastic collision, the ball almost always bounces and falls off. FEATURES: Invent your own ways to complete difficult levels. Solve interesting puzzles and unlock many new levels. Upgrade your cannon to shoot more balls. And also shoot different balls. Suitable for people who want to challenge themselves. No death, no panic . Focus only on getting into the glass jar. TIPS: Move the mouse away from the cannon. You can get a better level of fine-tuning. Use the mouse wheel to fine tune the cannon elevation. Click on the cannon to customize it.",
