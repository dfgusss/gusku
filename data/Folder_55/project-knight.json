    "About the game": "I saw that island in my dream... Always the same island... A great castle surrounded by different biomes... One where the rain never end... One where the fog is deadly thick... The one where you can freeze to death... The one where you can lose your soul in a giant maze... The one where hops burn like the lava on the floor... And finally the one where you can fall forever... In my dream i saw that island... I'm now there and there is no turning back... A lonely knight on a deadly island... Farewell... This game is a short real time combat collectathon with a cartoony looks in the style of zelda mixed with dark souls where you have to collect golden coins to progress through 6 unique biomes ( worlds )... This game have a life time of approximately 2 hours... Hope you guys have fun! We strongly recommend to play the game with a controller due to the frequent use of the camera. It is possible to play with the keyboard but it is not recommended. To rotate the camera from left to right with the keyboard use the ( Q and E keys ), from down to up use the ( F and R keys )... To zoom and unzoom the camera use the ( C and V keys ) and finally to reset the camera use the ( K key )... The game as been made entirely with the Smile Game Builder engine and as not been exported to Unity to customize it in any way! So this game is an example of what you can do with the SGB engine without any knowledge of programmation whatsoever! Keep in mind when playing that this engine is made to create turn by turn JRPG and not real time combat action!",
