    "About the game": "Pythagoria is a brain-teasing number puzzle game. The puzzle is simple to explain: find the missing value, which is denoted by a question mark highlighted in color. The only mathematics you need to know to get started is that the area of a rectangle is the length multiplied by the width. Only basic math knowledge is required to understand and solve the puzzles. Here’s what makes the puzzle hard: you are not allowed to use fractions in the solutions. All area puzzles can be solved using only whole numbers. Pythagoria is fun, brain-teasing puzzle game made for all ages. Solve the area puzzles from easier ones to harder ones, and remember that some of problems need kind of inspiration to solve. Features: - 60 Unique Puzzles - 5 Steam Achievements and Steam Trading Cards - Freehand drawing on the puzzles - Calm BGM Music",
