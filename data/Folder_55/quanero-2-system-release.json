    "About the game": "In our first VR project (Quanero VR) we’ve combined time manipulation with a VR-Story. You were able to slow down time, reverse it or bring it to a halt. Quanero 2 offers a similar experience, but a much bigger world for you to explore. Observe and connect the dots, to get to the bottom of it all! Background Information The work on 'Quanero 2 - System Release' stopped in 2018. All participants finished University and went to work in different jobs in different countries. Sadly Q2 never got finished. The project was too ambitious for a small inexperienced team. Some game mechanics were flawed the begin with and there was no cohesive logic behind it. We decided to strip Q2 of it's main gameplay mechanics and release a version of the game that resembles the first episode of Quanero. We still really hope you like it, have fun with it and can recognize the potential of VR storytelling. So go ahead and try it - you might like them choppy animations!",
