    "About the game": "RIP is an all-out war simulation on the ground, in the air or at sea. With 4 different Soldier classes and their specific weapons, you can fight as your heart desires and let the enemy bleed out in the dust. Show no mercy after all only the winners write the history books.RIP (Rest in Pieces) is an ongoing capture war like you would encounter in real life (we hope not !) were teams and soldier that score high for their country contribute to the conquering of the world visualized by a nation map, it's a long and stressful war only the bravest and most patriotic people will carry their country to victory, do you have it in you? What a wonderful time to be alive. Now, where's my gun?",
