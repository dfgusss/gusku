The universe is lonely, open and unforgiving. You're drifting, in a big, empty and silent space. Searching for a new home. You know a few coordinates to some random locations; but this is the only information you got. RymdResa is a challenging and evolving space adventure, based on randomness, with RPG elements. Abstract story elements and art are expressed throughout a lonesome and calm journey in space. Travel through a mysterious cosmos, deep and beyond. Discover the solitude of space!

Original Soundtrack Every ship has a custom soundtrack enhancing the world around it. Two musicians: Tom Croke and Pat Jacobs created the soundtrack with their vision of the game. Voiced Story A poetic voice log from the pilot describing a great loss, thoughts and feelings. Abstract fragments discussing the past, present and future. Nonviolent We didn't want to create yet another space-shooter, with laser-beams and exploding aliens. In RymdResa the gameplay is peaceful, passive and relaxing.",
