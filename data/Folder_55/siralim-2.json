    "About the game": "Siralim 2 is an old-school monster-catching RPG. Summon and customize hundreds of creatures to fight for you as you battle your way through endless dungeons. Find rare treasure and use it to upgrade your castle, empower your creatures, craft powerful artifacts, learn new spells, and much more. Every dungeon in Siralim 2 is randomly generated. This means that you'll never visit the same dungeon twice! Each dungeon also contains randomly generated quests and events, so there will always be fresh content for you to explore. Capture and summon over 600 unique creatures to fight for you. Each creature has its own, unique traits which greatly affect their performance in battle. Siralim 2 also features a breeding system! You can breed 2 creatures together and they'll lay an egg. The creature that hatches from the egg will inherit attributes from its parents. Breeding is the best way to unlock new creatures and to increase the strength of your party. Your creatures can equip powerful items called 'Spell Gems'. Spell Gems allow their owners to cast the spell associated with the gem. Each gem also has randomly generated properties, changing the way they function. One Fireball gem might cost Health instead of Mana, while another Fireball gem might be cast automatically after its owner attacks an enemy. There are over 300 different spells in the game, and each gem can have any 3 of 23 different properties. The possibilities are endless! Your creatures can equip artifacts which affect their stats, grant them new traits, and much more. With the help of the blacksmith and enchanter, you can forge, re-forge, brand, enchant, and disenchant your creatures' artifacts to suit their needs. Artifacts can have hundreds of possible properties, similar to how equipment works in games like Diablo . With over 800 different crafting materials to find, there are a lot of options available to you! But items aren't the only things you'll be crafting in Siralim 2. You can also turn your favorite creature into a 'Nether Creature', allowing you to augment it with powerful items that no normal creature can use. Add new rooms, unlock new creatures, and entice citizens to live in your castle by purchasing upgrades for it. As the ruler of Siralim, it falls on you to decide when to improve your castle. Siralim 2 is mean to be played forever. There is no level cap, nor are there any limits of any kind. The content becomes increasingly more difficult as you progress, so there's always a challenge waiting just around the corner no matter how long you play. The amount of content available to you is absolutely staggering - but don't worry; it's all introduced at a steady pace so as to not become too overwhelming. Some of our players have clocked in thousands of hours, and they still haven't seen all the game has to offer! Summon over 600 unique creatures to fight for you. Each creature has its own unique abilities. Breed your creatures to make them lay eggs. The offspring inherits attributes from its parents! Use your creatures to fight your way through randomly generated dungeons and complete randomized quests. Equip your creatures with spells. Spells can be found with randomly generated properties that change the way they behave in battle. Craft and customize equipment for your creatures with the help of over 800 different crafting materials. Upgrade your castle to unlock new rooms, NPCs, quests, and more! Tons of side content - gamble with the dwarves, fight in the battle arena, study in the library, cook a meal, entertain the riddle dwarves, and much more. An endless adventure - there are no level caps, no inventory space limits, and no true end to the game. Difficulty scales as high as you want. Siralim 2 is available for Steam on PC, Mac, and Linux. It is also available for Android, iOS, Playstation 4, and Playstation Vita. Players can use our cross-platform cloud saving feature to play the same save files across multiple different devices and operating systems (with the exceptions of PS4 and Vita)! Note: you do not need to play the first Siralim game in order to enjoy Siralim 2. They are two very different games!",
