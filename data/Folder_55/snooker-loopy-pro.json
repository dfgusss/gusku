    "About the game": "Put your expert break building skills to the test and become the World Number 1! This is 3 games in 1 ... Loopy Snooker, Loopy US Pool and Loopy UK Pool ... Yes, you read that right, 3 games in 1. The game contains fantastic graphics and sounds. Be careful not to make any mistakes ... the professor is soon to tell you! Use the free-ball wisely. A free-ball is awarded after each 50 points scored in Snooker, 200 in US Pool and 100 in UK Pool. You don't need to use the free-ball until you feel you could become trapped with no ball on. When this happens, tap the White ball to the right and then position the cue ball where you need it ... to ensure a continued break. Don't forget to clean the White, as in all games, that cue ball can get mighty dirty. Game play is simple ... use the hands to move the cue and then tap the thumb to hit the white. For Loopy Snooker ... Pot a Red, then a Colour, and repeat (the points awarded for each ball are the same has in real snooker). For Loopy Pool ... The rules have been modified slightly ... (US version) Pot a Spot, then a Stripe, and repeat ... (UK version) Pot a Red, then a Yellow, and repeat. You can change the baize too ... tap the colour pallet until a colour you like appears. If you're impatient, you can switch off the Professor animation ... tap the mini-prof. If the Snooker Loopy music isn't to your taste ... just switch it off by tapping on the music symbol.",
