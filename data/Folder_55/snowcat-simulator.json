    "About the game": "Everybody knows the giant vehicles preparing the white tracks for skier. No slope is too steep and no snowbank too huge. As driver of such a monster, it’s your job to prepare the runs in a giant ski area. Everyday crowds of people arrive at the peak of the mountain, ready to ski down perfectly prepared trails – and it’s up to you to make their wish come true. In order to fulfill this duty, the player must handle snowcats in various sizes. In addition to the ski runs, you must use high volume snow blowers to keep the roads to the ski area clear as well. It’s not an easy job. Strong winds and heavy snowfall exacerbates conditions on the slopes. There is only one way to get the job done - enter the snowcat. So start the engine and get this monster moving. By day or by night, it does not matter, the runs must be prepped before the first skiers arrive. Lower the shield of the snowcat and get ready to smooth &amp; groom the slopes. Features Multiplayer via LAN Fantastic Winter-Landscape with rundowns and ski-tracks Animated skiers and ski-lifts Dynamic snow system Weather effects Choose from a variety of huge snowcat models Keep the roads clear with the high volume snow blowers",
