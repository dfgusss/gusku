In this game the main objective is to run an energy business, you have to set up the solar panels, charging stations and the portal for the customers to come through. The challenge comes from having to keep up with ever increasing payments. How quickly do you invest, build up the solar panels, focus on gaining portals, but what if you spend too much too soon.. The main mode involves building the business to keep up with the payments, however time trial gives you 5 minutes to make as much money as you possibly can. The game is aimed to be a small and fill little time gaps, an average session can last 15 minutes depending on ability, but naturally the 5 minute time challenge mode lasts 5 minutes.",
