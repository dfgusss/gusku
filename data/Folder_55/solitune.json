    "About the game": "Being a shepherd is a strong symbol of escapism. It's no easy job, but there are some moments where you just want to leave your old life behind, to dream yourself among sheep. Break all your human bonds. Question yourself. Finally contribute and do real work with your hands. Get back to nature. SOLITUNE is about this moment where you just have enough and start a new path. Move from space to space and help out others. Every room has a unique song by Ludwig Hanisch!",
