    "Release date": "Oct 21, 2021",
    "About the game": "On the western coast stretches the Empire, the last known shard of human civilization. Occasionally, a person with the talent for magic is born there. Hunted and persecuted, such people are confined to the Sanctuaries for the Corrupted. Under the watchful eye of the Inquisition, the mages are made to work for the benefit of the state. Across the Great River from the Empire begin the Wild Lands. Once civilized, they are now roamed by predators, ghosts and demons. Dismal Marshes, Elderwood, Deceiving Plains: these lands are home to sentient non-human tribes. There is little contact and no sympathy between the Empire and these dwellers of the Wild Lands. At the feet of the Blue Mountains, in the north of the Wild Lands, rests the Spire of Sorcery. For centuries this sentient citadel slumbered, yet now it is awakened by a dark threat coming from the east. The Spire sounds an ancient Call, summoning all mages to join its cause. Answering its bidding, dozens of mages attempt to reach the Spire, attracted by the promise of a new life with the citadel. But only three succeed in crossing the Great River… SPELLCASTING WITH ORIGINAL TOKEN MECHANICS At the heart of the game is the original system of tokens that stack, convert and combine – binding together the effects of spellcasting, alchemic potions and environments, as well as character traits and their special powers. EXPLORE THE WORLD, DISCOVER AND EXPERIMENT The world of Rund is dark and full of dangers: each chapter features new biomes and new opponents. Discover new locations and new resources. Uncover new recipes when cooking food and concocting alchemy, procure new equipment. EXPERIENCE THE STORY, MAKE MEANINGFUL CHOICES Complete the journey that takes the mages from the Empire and into the Distorted Lands. Encounter different tribes and fractions, unlock side quests, make meaningful choices that affect the way that the campaign plays. MANAGE YOUR PARTY, EXPAND YOUR BASE Assemble your initial party based on stats, personal traits and specialisation of each mage. Upgrade their spellbooks, influence their mood, modify their looks. Find new party members. Expand the Spire with new rooms that unlock new mechanics. ABOUT THE DEVELOPER Spire of Sorcery is created by Charlie Oscar . This is our team’s second big release. Earlier, we shipped the native digital board game Gremlins, Inc. . Working together for the last seven years, we aim to create original games that reward players with new experiences! HOW IS THE GAME UPDATED? We update the game every month with quality-of-life improvements, and once every two months with new chapters and new mechanics. In this way, you’ll regularly have new challenges to try and mechanics to sample – all the way towards the full release. HOW LONG WILL THE GAME REMAIN IN EARLY ACCESS? We’re looking to reach version 1.0 before the end of 2022. We're hell-bent on shipping new content and new mechanics as fast as we can, and improving the balance and the interface based on the feedback that we receive.",
