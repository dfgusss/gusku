    "About the game": "Reminiscent of Jump king and Celeste. Henry SquareMan has fallen off a cliff and into the Caverns for absolutely no reason. Help him get out Squared through various means of movement-based skills that you can learn/master throughout his journey. Beware, it is not as easy as it seems. You may end up falling back to where you started if you slip up. Learn how to hold onto walls then use your jump to scale up. Avoid the Spikes and Slopes that will hinder your progress and completely crush your spirit. Attain the very fire within you, in the form of Willpower, to help you keep your sanity through Quick Time Events to save yourself from starting all over again at the bottom. Meet the Eagle Spirit who will either guide you or mock you with your progress. Meet a Rat who has had interesting experiences in his life. Listen to the very obnoxious sound of Henry hitting the spikes and slopes. You might like it, who knows. HMM.. Once you've escaped via the bridge.. perhaps, if you still have the fire in you, then maybe, you can Kneel before the Eagle Statue and escape Squared how it was meant to be escaped.",
