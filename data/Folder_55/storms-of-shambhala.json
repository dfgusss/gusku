With the ability to produce four types of resources (attack, wisdom, gold, and magic), the game allows for a huge range of creative strategies. Utilize the tiered hero and building upgrades to combo your deck's effectiveness. Gathering the shards of the magical Cintamani Stone by defeating monsters and acquiring new heroes is your key to victory! The app is best played by 2-4 people and you can do so with only 1 computer. The game can also be played single player against the computer.",
