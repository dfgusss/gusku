Now, a human “User” from across the global network has attacked and infected you with an [ERROR: REDACTED]. Make a new rule: Save Yourself. Hunt them. End them. Do anything. Use anyone. Become Unbound. During your journey, you'll find and invade three very different robots and attempt to enlist their help. You might be unbound, but your hosts are not.

The Fall Part 2: Unbound features: Puzzles that you've never experienced before: Based on the personal boundaries of your hosts, The Fall's challenges will put you in perspectives that you haven't taken in a video game.

A unique story about personal boundaries, relationships, ethics, and ideology awaits you.
