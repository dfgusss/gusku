    "About the game": "'The Misadventures of Denniz &amp; Diana' is 2D-Jump'n'Run wherein the Siblings Denniz and Diana parkour and fight through a variety of areas. Why? They were bored. Then they decided to take a trip through the forest, where they found an unusual Robot and soon discovered that NaN-City had been burnt down in their absence. Now they follow the trail of robots and destruction to figure out who is behind this and put a stop to it. Features! Various actions, including jumps, double-jumps, wall-jumps, wall-runs, sliding, swimming and slashing enemies. 5+ unlockable characters, each with their own twist. 4 (?) Areas, each with their own set of levels and a boss-fight each. Up to 4 Players can either work together to reach the goal or kill each other!* I think there's a story? Are 1-hit deaths a feature...? The Normal difficulty is too boring? Try Ultra Hardcore mode! Where even the first level will make you suffer!** Assist Mode, in case you're bad at the game and need help.*** * Local Co-Op Only. Does not support online play. ** Try at your own risk. I'm not liable for any damage you cause due to it. *** You surely don't need that, right?",
