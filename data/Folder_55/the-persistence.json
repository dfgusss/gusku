    "About the game": "The Persistence challenges you, a clone of security officer Zimri Eder, to survive aboard a doomed deep space colony starship, overrun with horrific and murderous aberrations. You are the last survivor. Your mission? Restore functionality to the ship and somehow make your way back to Earth. The Persistence Enhanced brings improved lighting, particle effects and further UX &amp; UI refinements along with DXR RayTracing implementation for supported graphics cards &amp; NVIDIA® DLSS. For VR owners please take note Motion controls are not supported. Navigate an ever-changing labyrinth A malfunction in the ship’s macrostructure means the layout of the decks will shift and change configuration periodically. Each and every expedition into The Persistence will be disorienting and different. Use darkness and cover Avoid being overwhelmed by the ship’s deadly new inhabitants. Move stealthily, strike from the shadows and deflect any onslaught of counter attacks with your personal shield. Explore, unlock and upgrade Harvest DNA material to improve health, toughness and defensive capabilities and loot materials &amp; schematics for weapon upgrades and suit customizations with perks. Death is just the beginning If Zimri dies, her consciousness is uploaded into a new cloned body, ready to try again with any upgraded stats, suits &amp; weapon schematics kept for the next attempt.
