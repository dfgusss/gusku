    "About the game": "After accidentally joining a cult, and quickly realizing their mistake, one cultist resolves to find a way out before they-to become another one of the countless victims of The Stronghold. There are a lot of locked doors between you and the nearest exit. Fortunately, most of them can be opened with good old-fashioned brain power. Push blocks, manipulate sentrymen, redirect boulders, and do whatever else may be necessary to keep moving forward. The Stronghold isn't a safe place. With dart traps, loads of sawblades, and more spikes than any building should reasonably have, it's nothing short of a miracle that there are any cultists left. Pay close attention to your surroundings to spot these traps, and you may make it out fully intact. Some doors can't be opened with critical thinking alone. These ones require special keys held by the Higher-Ups. While it may seem straight-forward, getting these keys will be no easy task; But, it's the only way you'll have any chance of making it out of here alive. With nothing but your wits and your trusty dagger, can you survive long enough to find a way out? Or will you be The Stronghold's next victim?",
