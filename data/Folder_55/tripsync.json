    "About the game": "You're given a computer capable of simulating thousands of unique dialog driven interactions between different NPC's on miniature tabletop world. The characters within these worlds are thrown into an environment of the users choice and given different identities which affects the narrative of the story. Simply connect a uniquely themed game cartridge to the computers input slot and click play to begin. Using neural networks, the stories begin with a vague initial plot which is then used as the pretext to the NPC interactions. The NPC's perceive your voice as their God. You're also able to purchase unlimited gameplay usage if you enjoy the game and want more.",
