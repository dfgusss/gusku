    "Release date": "Nov 15, 2021",
    "About the game": "You find yourself in a mysterious town with a strong urge to take a leak, but peeing on the ground is not a possibility. Toilets clog fast, Urge-powered vehicles eject fumes, so be careful, because when the Urge rush once comes, it is very hard to get back from it. Main features: The Urge is a need which you have to satisfy in local toilets, plastic bottles or other enclosed containers. Not achieving that will have consequences. The yellow fog shows the amount of Urge dust in the air. Causing more crazy junkies to crawl out even faster, speeding up your Urge fill, etc. Chop down trees to build yourself a base or just look around for plywood to barricade one of the abandoned houses. Lay down traps to keep you safe inside. Use a variety of makeshift or found weapons, melee weapons and throwables against horrific junkies desperate for every drop of Urlid. Drive vehicles hidden around the town. Powered with gasoline or modified, that run on Urlid. Explore and build during the day. Defend your base at night. Search for supplies and use them for crafting.",
