    "About the game": "An undead lord is terrorizing the countryside and every hunter in the realm is clamoring to be the first to stake'm! Play as two hunters who band together in their quest to defeat the new evil first! This is a cozy 90s JRPG style game where finding topics to banter about is a key to survival and trading stories of past battles gets you new and powerful skills. It's a lot of jokes, think a LucasArts Adventure teamed up with a Final Fantasy clone. Turn based combat, trading games, dungeon puzzles (e.g. box pushing) and lot of be people to talk to and banter topics to collect. There are options in the game to make combat easy and to give hints for the puzzles. You can turn them on and off anytime. This game was made in a few weeks for my DnD group and now it's out here for anyone who might enjoy it!
