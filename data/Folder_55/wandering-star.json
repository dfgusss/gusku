    "About the game": "You are a team of researchers going to explore a planet for possible colonization. Unexpected storms have crashed your ship and you are now stranded on the planet's surface. Pick your class from 4, each with their own skills and abilities. Search out for parts to help repair the ship and escape this planet. There is an uneasy feeling you are not alone. A survival game where you have to go around on the planet and mine resources to find parts scattered inside them. Once you find a part, bring it back to the ship to help repair and get off the planet. The longer you take, the harder it will become as the alien locals don't seem to enjoy your visit. Build up your defenses around the ship long enough to hold out the attacks while you find parts to get off the planet. Each character you can pick from has their own abilities and skills to help out with your play style. Do you think you can hold out and get off the planet?
