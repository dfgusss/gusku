    "About the game": "Protect your BRAINS! Zombie Scrapper is a twin-stick shooter that drops you right into the zombie apocalypse! You will battle hordes of zombies in destructible environments; not just your regular undead horde, but you'll have to outmaneuver fast zombies, out muscle big beefcake zombies, and make exploding zombies go boom! All while scavenging whatever scrap you can get your hands on to unlock a truly powerful arsenal of weapons, to keep your brains where they belong! EPIC CAMPAIGN From solely trying to survive to stumbling your way into a secret facility and escaping it. There is a lot to experience in the 36 zombie-infested levels that you are thrown into. SURVIVE FOREVER If barely surviving the zombie apocalypse didn't leave a satisfying taste in your mouth. Test your survival skills and earned arsenal in 12 endless horde levels to see how long you can really survive. OVERCOME THE HORDE No one ever survived without learning some new tricks! Train yourself with unique skills that will improve your movement speed, strength, and resourcefulness to hope that you can live another day. GEAR UP Take the fight to the zombies by unlocking 36 new takes on classic zombie fighting weaponry like fire axes, samurai swords, shotguns, and rifles. Collect enough scrap and the zombies won't know what hit them with weapons like the flame thrower, rocket launcher, and mini-gun. 100% Master the game by completing all 14 achievements that will show off that you aren't someone to mess with once the dead walk this earth. KILL IN STYLE No one ever said you need to look like a scrub while fighting zombies. Customize your appearance with 12 different hats that range from super silly to outright rad.",
