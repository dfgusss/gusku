Sinners will have to contemplate the horrors in order to get out of this ill-fated place. You are not going to play for the best person. All his life he was a real monster. Since childhood, the character has stolen money from his weak classmates. In his student years he committed crimes, for which he was not always been punished. Even the girl left him, because he did not trust her, and therefore he went on treason, which is why they later parted.
