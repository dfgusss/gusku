    "About the game": "“2017” is an excellent VR Co-op Survival game, in which players from all over the world gather together in teams to try and hold back the zombie hordes and prevent the outbreak from spreading any further. You won't miss it! The only way to survive, is through good teamwork. Rescue your teammates when down to get them back into the fight, deal with any zombies outside their field of vision, mend broken windows and doors whilst they are busy shooting, etc. Explore the game map carefully to discover useful items or warning signs like, petrol canisters, working intercom systems, a laptop lying on a counter still with some charge or the warning cry outside of ravens startled by something moving. Blasting out its lethal .45 bullets to blow zombie heads apart, the M1911, pistol has been doing its close quarter killing since before the second World War. Strafe them with the powerful AS (Avtomat Spetsialnij) Val assault rifle to slow the zombie tide threatening to engulf you. Use the telescopic sights of the former Soviet Union SVD (Snayperskaya Vinyovka Dragunov) sniper rifle to kill safely from distance. Detonate the Mk2 or M26 hand grenades to blow apart mass ranks of zombies or explode a petrol barrel to rain fiery death upon them. With the supply boxes found around the game maps, survival players can randomly obtain medical supplies, ammunition packs or a variety of weapons. Each opening of the supply box costs coins, which are earned through killing zombies. Executing a headshot brings an additional coin bonus to the player. Multiplayer game “2017”is a multiplayer FPS which supports up to 4 player Co-op in game. Although multiplayer is not a mandatory requirement, we strongly recommend to you the benefits of joining a survival team to support each other, provide overwatch, medical care and maximize your chances of survival through safety in numbers. Global Survivors Ranking We provide a standard ranking system in game. Invite your friends to join with you to shoot apart the zombie plague and see how high you can rank amongst all the survivors across what is left of the world. Caution! Before first starting the game, make sure there is enough cleared space surrounding you, with no furniture or any other items around, which may cause injury whilst wearing the headset. Ensure all motion controllers are fully charged.",
