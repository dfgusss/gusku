    "About the game": "Aimi is a short, atmospheric horror game initially created for the IGMC 2018 but which has since been expanded upon and improved. This game is heavily story-driven, with horror taking a backseat to a more in touch and emotional story and with gameplay being made up of puzzles in between longer cutscenes. An initial playthrough of Aimi could be completed in about 1 hour. However, there are multiple different endings that can extend gameplay. Additionally, Aimi was developed as a sort of therapy game by a 16-year-old kid (me!) so do keep that in mind. While Aimi contains only a few optional jumpscares, there is a lot of cartoon blood and gore and extensive swearing. The game explores themes of mental illness and suicide in a thoughtful manner. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Almost every random crash, increase in lag, or other error can be fixed entirely with a simple game restart. If you encounter an error that isn't fixed after a restart, please message me in one of the appropriate forums.",
