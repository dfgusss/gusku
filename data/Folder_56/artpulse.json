Spawn and combine shapes, colors, and freehand painting to sync them seamlessly into the background music. You don’t need to be an experienced artist or musician to make cool stuff, but you can just create and let the game elevate it! Each shape and color emits a different sound, which will sync with the background song that the player chooses. Having no rules allows you to do whatever you want to. Fly around spawning shapes or create a tree in the colors of a rainbow. Features 6 base songs (for now!) to create a soundscape on A toolkit full of unique visuals and sound effects A color wheel to select different tunes Customizable cinematic, endless and time-limited modes Free flying movement In development More base songs Customization possibilities Submit your own music to be included in ArtPulse Join our Discord server here:",
