    "About the game": "'Block' is the main puzzle element, and many places also need to test the player's certain operations and reactions. The player controls the movement of the square by the up, down, left and right keys, and the space controls the jump. And use the number keys 1, 2, 3, 4 above to switch between different colors and use different capabilities. Overall similar to the I wanna fa trap with a skill version. At present, the game is still in the semi-finished stage, and later will improve the game's art materials, music sound effects, and add game effects. If you have any good suggestions for the game, you can send an email to my email address. I will adopt good ideas and opinions. The final form of the game hopes to launch an edit mode, allowing players to freely design levels for other players to play（By the way,thanks my friend Mr.Cui for his help about some interesting idea and the movie）",
