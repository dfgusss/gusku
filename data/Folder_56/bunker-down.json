    "About the game": "Through the window of your bunker you stare into the wasteland beyond yearning for the day you might return. Someone appears, looking into their eyes you see desperation, tiredness and despair. Will you let them join you inside or will you leave them outside to die. In Bunker Down you need to speak to people on the outside of your bunker and decide if you will let them join you in safety. You only have a limited amount of space so you can't save everyone. Try and get the best outcome for the people you let in and for the world as whole will you be able to rebuild society or will all of humanity perish... The choice is yours. You have to balance the morality of your decisions with having the skills required to be able to rebuild. This is a short (5 min runs) but replayable game where you will meet a large cast of characters and try and get the best (or worst) of 10+ endings. - Difficult game designed to really make you think about your choices in order to get the best ending - Easy to pick up and play (only a mouse is required) - Bleak story (but sometimes humorous) - Varied and interesting characters",
