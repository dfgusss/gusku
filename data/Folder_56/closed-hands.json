    "About the game": "CLOSED HANDS is a groundbreaking work of interactive fiction by PASSENGER, directed by Dan Hett. The game follows the deep intertwined stories of five people thrown together by their involvement in a fictional terror attack. This sprawling story plays out through a combination of traditional interactive text, as well as explorable computer interfaces, conversations, IM's, phonecalls and more. CLOSED HANDS is a fragmented and complex narrative, playable in any order, that tells the story of the lead-up and aftermath of the attack: some stories go forward in time, some backwards, and some both. Players can choose to follow a single narrative arc, or jump between perspectives to get the full picture of everything that happens to the city, and it's inhabitants. Game features: A rich, deep work of interactive fiction - 130,000+ words across almost 150 scenes written by Dan Hett, Dan Whitehead, Sharan Dhaliwal and Umar Ditta Five distinct intertwining character arcs, and dozens of additional scenes to fill out the full story. Follow a single character, or move between them to understand the full picture. Nine possible endings to the game, with non-linear progression to get there. Discover everything by experimenting with key character decisions. Features a dynamic ambient soundtrack by Ciaran McAuley (RUMA) that reacts to tension and events within the game as it unfolds Game theme music composed and performed by Paul Wolinski (65daysofstatic, No Man's Sky) STEAM EDITION exclusive features: Full audio developer's commentary throughout: learn about the context, writing, sound, and production behind this project scene-by-scene Full soundtrack included in the download: a curated ambient selection of layered tracks by Ciaran McAuley, and the original and remixed Closed Hands theme by Paul Wolinski (65daysofstatic, No Man's Sky) An ebook version of the game's story (epub/PDF) with the sequence and scenes chosen by the writing team. Experience the game's interactive prose as a traditional novel. Access to a library of original artwork, sketches, and example Ink scripting files",
