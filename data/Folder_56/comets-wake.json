    "About the game": "Comets Wake[\\b] is a first-person action game with procedurally generated worlds and lots of loot. A formerly peaceful realm has now been turned violent by the arrival of the mysterious Red Comet. It is up to you to destroy the minions of the Red Comet and save the remaining peaceful inhabitants. But you won’t have to do it alone, one of the young golems has escaped and is helping you find your way and rescue his buddies. The Red Comet has given its minions unnatural powers, so be careful! Enemies will try to punch you, make the ground beneath you explode, shoot lasers at you and more. Use your weapons and powers to fight back, like with a staff that shoots fireballs. The expansive worlds of floating islands have many different biomes and points of interest to explore. Warm up and heal next to fires, or relax next to a waterfall. Generate custom worlds and share the seeds with friends. Choose the size of the world, the difficulty, the level type, and more. You’ll have to find your arsenal from across the realm. Stock up on a variety of different guns, bows, swords, maces, hammers, axes, shields, throwing knives, and mage staffs. Cast spells and use the weapons’ special abilities to make your sword giant, blow up a wave of enemies with a fireball, or engage the bow's rapid fire. Discover weapons in chests all over the realm, or buy them at purchase stations. There are so many options to choose from, so find what works best for you! Fight your way to the Red Comet and defeat it once and for all!",
