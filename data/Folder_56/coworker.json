    "About the game": "Your job is to produce grenades and mines , give them to the NPC coworker , who puts it in a box , and then you have to sell it by dropping it down the hatch. From the money you can upgrade your equipment. Turret speed Ammo capacity and refill speed batteries capacity and charge speed flamethrower... You need to set up automated turrets to protect you from the zombies so you can keep working. Turrets need battery and ammo . They don't work if they are knocked over . Battery chargers and the ammo box refiller are on the right side. If the turrets are not enough, feel free to use the flamethrower but keep in mind, that it can overheat. There are few automated ' cannons ' which launch anything you can put in them, but don't trust them with your life! If nothing else works, just grab something and throw it at the zombies! Somtimes a random crate comes at the middle, hopefully it will have something useful in it, like a new turret or battery... The next one comes sooner if you sell a lot of things with a high value. Up to 6 players can play The goal of the game is to stay alive as long as you can and have fun",
