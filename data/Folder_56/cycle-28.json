    "About the game": "Cycle 28 is a 2D space shooter in the classic arcade style that keeps you pushing for a high score. The controls are simple. The action is fast-paced. Intense dogfights lead to epic, screen-filling bosses. As Olivia Bergen – a flight lieutenant that has become separated from her fleet – you're stuck in Cycle 27. You live it over, and over, and over again. And if that wasn’t bad enough, every time you drop from warp they are waiting for you. You don’t know who they are or what they want. You just know you’re the only thing between them and home. So you get better, faster, stronger. Maybe one of these Cycles you’ll figure it out. Until then, you can only keep dying. Key Features Fast-paced combat — Power slide your way between more bullets than any lesser pilot could handle. Nothing feels better than using your ship’s gun to propel you through enemy-infested space as you grip the trigger ever tighter. Upgrades — Beat your personal high score in a run to unlock upgrades. With 45 possible configurations, customise your ship and master new tactics to live just a little longer. Evolving story — Uncover the secrets of why you’re stuck in Cycle, why they’re hell-bent on destroying everything you love, and just who they really are. Epic original score —A powerfully atmospheric mix of modern orchestral and retro electronic sounds by Jordan Rees. (Composer of trailer music for The Mummy [Universal Pictures], Mother [Paramount Pictures], The Defenders [Marvel Studios]). Cycle 28 won’t be easy. It won’t be quick. But that’s okay. You’re not going anywhere.",
