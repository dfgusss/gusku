    "About the game": "Venture into a forbidden cursed city in the hopes of rescuing your sister! It's set up in a rogue-like manner, where you enter the forbidden city of Atlantris, and if you are nearing death, you get teleported out by your sorcerer friend. You get to keep all of your experience and items, but have to start from the beginning every time you die! There are more than fifteen 'levels' and the player can expect to beat the game in around 3 hours if they're good. The battles are turn based and feature a neat sliding bar that you have to press at the right time to execute attacks. Beyond that there are random item drops from the enemies, and many skills to be learned. There's also a hidden character.",
