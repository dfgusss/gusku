    "About the game": "You are the last hope of a once proud race against the unstoppable Elvish tide. A difficult top down, fast paced game about wetting your whistle and trying to save your people the only way you know how. Killing elves. You wake up after getting a little too enthusiastic the night before an important battle and must pull yourself together dodging your less hungover enemies until you get yourself together. Featuring 40 levels of increasing difficulty with a focus on tight movement and strategic play, dodge and weave your way to your next drink until you are able to put up a bit more of a fight.",
