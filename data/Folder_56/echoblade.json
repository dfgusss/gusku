    "About the game": "EchoBlade is a puzzle-combat dungeon explorer. You find yourself blind and trapped inside an expansive tower labyrinth. Shrouded in total darkness you must navigate your way to freedom using only sound as your guide. See the world in ultrasonic: every footstep, every metal clank of armor, or swing of blade illuminates your path. Stride with care to avoid pressure plates that spring a variety of traps. Equip your sword blade or let loose crossbow bolts when encountering the armored crusader knights who lurk the dark dungeon hallways. Explore the perilous tower. Each level is built with varying mechanics: patrolling prison guards, uncover hidden switches that open secret doors, and solving puzzles with platforming elements. Venture forth and find your way to freedom.",
