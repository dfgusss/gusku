    "About the game": "End Reach is a roguelike top-down shooter inspired by the brutal gore of Hotline Miami and the heart pounding action of Nuclear Throne. Story While exploring ancient mine shafts, our protagonist slips down a tunnel during an earthquake, finding himself in an unusual cave inhabited by a hostile population. Wielding a pistol meant for cave spiders, take the reins of our protagonist and shoot your way out. But hurry! The aftershock of the quake just unleashed a rapid of lava barreling towards you. Gameplay This game puts you in a cave with aliens that want to kill you. While shooting anything that moves, find weapons and items in loot rooms, defeat bosses and of course; get to the End Reach.",
