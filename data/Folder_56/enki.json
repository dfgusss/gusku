    "About the game": "ENKI is a repeatable horror experience about escaping, featuring multiple endings that will ensure you that every playthrough will always be slightly different from the previous one, whether you as a player succeeded in escaping or not. Find your way to freedom through occult symbolism, mysteries and discoverable secrets. For success is not guaranteed. Locked up in a dark cellar the player only has a short time to figure out what has happened and how to escape from the clutches of a dangerous serial killer. By finding items and solving puzzles the player can escape, but because of the smart randomization this will prove a challenge every time. Your most likely ending is a horrible and painful death. But should you be able to find a way to escape, you will be granted one of the many different endings depending on how many secrets you managed to unlock while escaping. Also, there may be more than just the most obvious way out… While exploring and finding your way out, you will uncover more information about the serial killer holding you. Ancient occult magic and mysteries will be revealed to you, and you will discover that there is far more at stake than just your life…",
