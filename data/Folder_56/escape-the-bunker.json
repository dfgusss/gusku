It features half a dozen different interconnected rooms, with various puzzles to solve and a small bit of suspense towards the end. There are no “jump scares”, and nobody is trying to kill you. It’s a problem-solving game, in which you use your reasoning skills to find ways of opening doors, unlocking locks and using a variety of items to move forwards through the game and eventually Escape the Bunker. Play times vary from 40 minutes to just over an hour, depending on how familiar you are with this genre of game. Features: full room scale experience push-to-walk movement (no teleporting) half a dozen rooms dozens of items puzzles all make logical sense professional voice acting (used sparingly)",
