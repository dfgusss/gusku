    "About the game": "The kickboxing fights are here once again and it's time to prove your mettle, show them who's boss in this kickboxing title. Don't think that this is just a walk in the park, these guys you're up against are ruthless, fast and worse, they're killers. This is going to be one of the roughest of challenges you can come across and if you can make it here, odds are you'd make it anywhere else. So watch yourself, be smart, intuitive, reflexive and knock these guys out, if you can. Rules, only the one rule, knock your opponent out till he can't move again. No formal technical knockouts, if you or your opponent don't get up before the referee countdown, that's when the match is won or lost. There's no three knockouts to define a winner in this title, once you or your opponent can get back up, the fight continues. Fighting Spree is designed with minimal hardware requirements allowing it to run on the lightest of PCs, is ideal for any PC.",
