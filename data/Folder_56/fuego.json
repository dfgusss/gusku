    "About the game": "Fuego! Fuego is an online Mexican standoff game between two opposing players and their teams of gun toting animal-banditos. The game starts in the standoff where players position and orient their banditos one at a time, in double blind turns. During the standoff players are trying to unravel the impending shootout while identifying strategic linchpins and outsmarting their opponent. After all the banditos have been placed, the shootout ensues and the players watch the consequences of their actions. You shoot a bank, you get the gold. You shoot a bandito, you steal the gold. Just make sure that when the dust settles, your gang walks away with the bigger haul. Even if that means losing a few friends along the way. Game Modes Online Multiplayer Play against random opponents or arrange matches with friends Collect new animal banditos and accumulate gold Single Player / Offline Single Player Puzzle Mode - Solve 60 Mexican standoff puzzles AI - Practice your skills against an AI opponent Press / Awards 'Indie Game Showcase' - Boston Festival of Indie Games, 9 September, 2015 'Indie Prize Showcase' - Casual Connect, 11 August, 2015 'PAXEast2015 Indie MEGABOOTH Showcase' - Indiecade, 6 March, 2015 'Best of IXC Game Tasting' - Indiecade, 9 October, 2014 'Quick and elegant fun.' - Alice O'Connor, Rock Paper Shotgun 'Just a super addicting game.
