There will be random items of resources in the battlefields. The player can defeat all opponents to win the game but can not be resurrected after being defeated. Skills: the surrounding islands produce supplies and synthetic materials, and players could avoid disputes and accumulate more resources. The central island produces more advanced armor and weapons.
