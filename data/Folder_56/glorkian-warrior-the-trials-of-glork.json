    "About the game": "BECOME A GLORKIAN WARRIOR! Visit awesome asteroids! Blast strange invaders! Glorkian Warrior: The Trials of Glork is a collaboration between Eisner Award winning cartoonist James Kochalka and indie game studio Pixeljam, makers of DINO RUN and POTATOMAN SEEKS THE TROOF. It's a goofy mashup of Galaga-style shoot-em-up, simple platforming action, and Saturday morning cartoon. Help Glorkian Warrior and his trusty Super Backpack fight against an endless onslaught of alien creatures, and be prepared for anything... the Magic Robot appears when you least expect it, and might shower you with exploding basketballs... or kittens... or cakes! Collect energy crackers and power up an awesome arsenal of double lasers, triple lasers, rockets, fireballs, tennis balls &amp; more while the invaders hypnotize you with their mesmerizing attack patterns. Perhaps you may even uncover the legendary Flarf Gun and save the world. You will have so much fun trying and dying, again and again.... but no matter how miserable your performance, each play session will add to your progress and unlock new features to keep your fingers and fun zone fully engaged! FEATURING: ◊ Art &amp; story by James Kochalka, First Cartoonist Laureate for the state of Vermont! ◊ Procedurally generated invader flight patterns and formations, with many landscapes to explore ◊ Endearing characters and all-ages humor ◊ Based on Kochalka's graphic novel “The Glorkian Warrior Delivers a Pizza' ◊ YES! Can you reach the rank of Glorkian General or will you forever stay a Soft-Boned Space Cadet? GLORK!",
