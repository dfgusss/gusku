    "About the game": "Break into the new apeX of 2D action! Luminous Avenger iX 2 takes the series' original speedy and stylish 2D action gameplay to the next level as Copen rips through enemies with his new 'Break-Shift' form. His new destructive capabilities makes the high-speed action more satisfying than ever! INTI CREATES is proud to present new apeX of cutting-edge 2D action with Luminous Avenger iX 2! ●2D action that breaks new ground! With his new spinning blade weapon, the Razor Wheel, Copen rips through any enemy standing in his way as he traverses an enormous tower. A wide variety of stages with powerful boss characters lurking in them await him. Copen earns a new EX Weapon for his arsenal whenever he defeats a boss. He uses these weapons to target enemies' weak points to bring them down faster; a key strategy to clearing stages and ascending the tower quickly. Copen's Bullit Dash that allows him to fly freely through the air has also been powered up! Super-stylish maneuvers reward those who master the Bullit Dash's high-speed capabilities! ●Tear through your enemies at break-neck speed! Copen takes on all challenges by changing seamlessly between his two forms: the power-focused 'Break-Shift' and the speed-enhanced 'Bullit-Shift.' Crush your enemies in Break-Shift to bank points and activate Overdrive! In Overdrive, Copen can stay in Bullit-Shift mode longer, allowing him to zip through the air at high speed. ●The 'Muse of Hope' Lola is lovelier than ever! Her songs really light up the stage! When Copen's HP hits 0, Lola can transform and activate her Anthem skill to bring Copen back to life using the power of song. She brings that recovery power to the frontlines in Luminous Avenger iX 2 with her newest and cutest form yet: Healing Mode! This powerful new ability heals Copen to full HP at any time, anywhere, and as often as he likes...with no cost! Build up over 1000 Kudos points and Lola will really heat up the battle with her song! ●An intense standalone story! Luminous Avenger iX 2 is set in a parallel world where a dystopic story unfolds in a ruined desert wasteland where only robots exist. Characters both familiar and new come together for this exciting story, featuring English voiceover for the very first time in the entire Gunvolt series!
