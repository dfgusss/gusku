The in-game world spans from the tribes of Sushen and Fuyu, on the bank of the Black River in the East, to the land of Kangju and Dayuan on the West of the lofty Pamirs. Two hundred cities, large and small, represent more than thirty countries, cultures and tribes at the time.

Many of them are digitally crafted for the first time, and brings a window for the player to glance at the eastern weaponry and culture from more than two millennia ago.

The player can join the force of a general, follow his commands, garrison at the border and fight in the battles of Monan as to experience of career of a veteran soldier of the Han Empire. The player can also lead a sizable force for one’s own, to stand back on a high rock and issue commands to the formations in the battle ground. With accumulated victories, the player may ascend along military ranks and eventually make to the imperial commander-in-chief. If one wishes, the player can also take down and rule a city for oneself, establish workshops and train one’s new troops, to compete for hegemony among the great emperors and khans. More, and lot more, is to be explored in Han Xiongnu Wars.",
