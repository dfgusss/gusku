    "About the game": "Helix Brawl In a race for supremacy, the government seeks to achieve global invincibility through total military power. Seen as ‘expendable resources’ civilians convicted of even minor crimes have been forcibly ‘volunteered’ into a program designed to make the ultimate soldiers. Through genetic splicing and the introduction of animal attributes, they hope to create perfect living weapons which are completely adaptable in battle. Play as Knox , an innocent man who's been forcibly entered into this program who now wants revenge for what hes become. He’s prepared to go through the entire chain of command, regardless of the moral compromises necessary, just so he can take up his ‘complaints’ with the head of this operation in person. Not to mention, leave a wake of destruction behind him! Single-player Beat em' Up Fun Helix Brawl is a single-player beat em' up action game. Make your way enemy by enemy, beating up bosses and unlocking new powers as you go. Each boss you defeat gives you a new range of powers to brawl with. Each level is all or nothing! So figure out your ability's ins-and-outs and manage that health bar to make it to the end of each!",
