Kaiju listens to your system audio to drive its visualizations in real time. This means music and video streaming services, games, movies and even human voices from VOIP all work to power the effects; it hears what you hear. Alternatively, your microphone can be used to make your voice and the ambience of the room drive the system. Kaiju does not record any audio or require special permissions. It makes use of Windows' audio APIs commonly used for noise cancellation. Key Features Real time 2D and 3D visualizations Works with streaming services, VOIP, games and more...
