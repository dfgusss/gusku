    "About the game": "Can you survive in the city of Trenn? In this fantasy themed, turn-based city simulation game, players will need to use their wits to see it through to the end! Your citizens will look to your leadership when successful, or they may abandon the town when you make massive mistakes. The choice is yours. Your main objective: to build a prosperous town. To achieve this, you must recruit villagers and create a thriving city as you contend with world events like monster attacks and refugees, market upswings (or recessions), and trade deals with neighboring towns. Choose from various businesses such as: hotels, stables, and weapon makers! Each of these contributes a different purpose to Trenn and over time: will help you grow your empire. Kalling Kingdom incorporates a simulated marketplace for players to take advantage of. Understanding just the right time to invest and sell could drastically alter the events to come. Organization, a keen eye, and a little risk could lead to big results when it comes to funding your town. Do you have what it takes to lead?",
