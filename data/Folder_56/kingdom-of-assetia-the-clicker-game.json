    "About the game": "In Kingdom of Assetia: The Clicker Game, your task is to restore the village of Anywhere - a former premier adventuring hub - to its former glory after it got hit by a major flood. As the mayor, you will have to rebuild the village from scratch. As only a single house has been left unharmed, you'll have to start there. Upgrade the building by clicking a lot to unlock more investment opportunities and upgrades. Your income will also continue to flow while you aren't playing. After a while of clicking the second part - idle resource production - will open up, which will greatly accelerate upgrading the buildings to the maximum level and serve as an extension to the clicker gameplay. Features hybrid between idle/clicker game and resource production pretty decent 3D graphics using free assets only (see below) lovely music a bunch of Steam Achievements to unlock Liner Notes The entire game - except for most of the code - has been deliberately created using free assets from the Unity Asset Store and other free sources. As I am a single developer and not an artist I had to use store assets anyway but to challenge myself I used only assets that were offered for free. During the Early Access period this rule has been partially - and deliberately - broken by using some paid assets I already owned anyway, although this only affects code. A full list of used assets is included with the game.",
