Travel through the world of Eterra’s past and face dark empires, wrathful gods and untouched wilds – to find a way to save time itself from The Void. Key Features 15 Mastery Classes Begin your adventure as a base class which can then specialize into one of three Mastery Classes. When specializing into a certain Mastery you will be able to access new skills and specialize your playstyle! 100+ Skill Trees Every active skill has its own augment tree that can completely change how the skill functions. Transform your skeletons into archers, your lightning blast into chain lightning, or make your serpent strike summon snakes to fight alongside you! Hunt Rare &amp; Powerful Loot Fill your arsenal with magic items you craft to perfection, change the rules of your build with powerful unique and set items, and always have that next upgrade just on the horizon with Last Epoch's randomized loot system. Time Travel The world of Eterra is home to many factions and secrets. Travel to different points in time to change the world's fate, and fight to set it onto a new path.
