    "About the game": "Set in the future, when Corporations have turned to space to mine resources for Earth, we find Eli (YOU, our player), a rogue inventor and scientist who has changed the face of mining technologies in The Verse. Driven by developing a technological beacon of hope and restoring his legacy, Eli struggles to keep his space station together in the face of explosive experiments and keep it safe from Corporate hackers and attacks at every turn. Along the way, he attracts the attention of Corporate Raiders and factions that will steal his technology if he lets them, if he doesn’t….his death is an acceptable alternative. When his back is against the wall, Eli (voiced by Sam McMurray) finds himself aided by SARA (voiced by Julie Ann Emery), a highly illegal and sentient AI and the station’s most recent addition. Developed by Eli’s oldest and most brilliant friend, Dr Janice Barnes, SARA is both a gift and a refugee, As you play, WATCH OUT, Eli has made some high-profile enemies along the way. And this technology CANNOT fall into the wrong hands. Good luck, and may The Verse be with you. Story development by Julie Ann Emery (TV’s Better Call Saul, Preacher) Lead gameplay development by Christian Moe (Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering) Play with Science Experience an episodic game following Eli, a deep-space moon mining mastermind working on the next big thing. LithoBreak combines fun gameplay, advanced science concepts, and a deep Sci-Fi verse. Chemistry and Materials Every material gathered starts off as a combination of real crystal compounds. When utilized directly, the amount of each compound determines the final material properties. Otherwise, the base compounds are utilized directly in material processes, such as separating Silicon metal from Silicon Oxide through a reduction process. Orbital Mechanics Everything in-game, including the station itself, is part of an orbital mechanics simulation. As the station orbits the moon, the moons, planets and stars ‘move’ as well. Materials needing to be transferred from site to site will also utilize this mechanic to determine movement and travel times. Engineering Processes Every material processing technology is based upon scientific principles and real process technologies. This includes sifting ceramic powder by density, maintaining elemental conservation, and ensuring a thermitic reaction processes are properly ‘energetic’. Realistic Surroundings The station was designed with engineering oversight, giving the space the feeling that someday, this could be real . Explore a storied space station filled with the background of Eli and the greater verse Mine materials with unique elemental makeups and engineering properties Process and refine materials using processes based upon properties and chemistry Produce parts for mining equipment, with quality based upon material properties All parts wear out over time Move parts and materials around with spacecraft following orbital mechanics",
