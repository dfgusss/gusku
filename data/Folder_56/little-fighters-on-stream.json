    "About the game": "Little Fighters on Stream is a compilation of mini games in which you can play directly with the Twitch chat on your stream using commands. It features a growing selection of accion, skill and memorization mini-games in which you'll have to run, hit, throw and more with your Twitch chat. The chat can play using commands that are specified in the lobby of each mini game, while the streamer executes the game and transmits it, showing to the chat with a little transmission delay, his situation within the game. Mini-games, each of them with specific rules, rhythm and funny interactions. 4 very varied mini-games (soon a new game) for you to play with your stream chat (we're always adding new games) Fun design of characters, locations and environments. Items, in case you need more action and frenzy. A sound design that will make you frantic. Little Fighters on Stream is a game designed for interaction and fun. The minigames that we have finished are: Struggle : Is a wrestling game where players will fight a battle with the other participants. Where it Gone? : Will test your memory and speed to remember tiles. Juegardo : It is a competition where participants must throw the hoop. Explosive Paint : The streamer draws a secret word and the chat must guess it or everything will explode. Escape: The Killer Swuid : |soon| The chat must reach the goal, however if you move in the red light, you will die. All mini games are designed with transmission delay in mind. This won't be a problem because all the mini games have a comfortable response time. Try it and you'll see it.",
