    "About the game": "You come from a long line of adventurers Your mother, an adventurer herself, was murdered by Orcs as they ransacked your town Many villagers died, and even more were captured. Until they are free, your town is but a shadow of its old self. Worse yet, the Savage Orc that leads them is getting stronger and building an army In ten days your town will be overrun Are you a bad enough dude to save them? Marburgh is a text based, dungeon crawler in the style of Legend of Red Dragon, Usurper and Exiltilus. You play three members of an adventuring family who's town was attacked by Monsters. This is my first released game and is very much a work in progress. I will be adding a ton to it as I go. I will also take an incorporate as much feedback as possible.",
