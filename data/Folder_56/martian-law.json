    "About the game": "Mars is under attack! An unknown enemy is dropping bombs on the peaceful red planet. It is up to you to fight off the onslaught so the innocent can escape in this stylized shooter from Linclo Games. Run (umm...slide), jump and blast your way to freedom in the arcade-inspired goodness that is Martian Law. Save Mars! FEATURES Old school, 1980s-inspired arcade shooter. Original hand-drawn 2D art. Classic 8-directional aiming. Full controller support. Infinite replay value, beat your high score. GAMEPLAY Shoot bombs and avoid explosions, allowing the innocent Martians to escape to their underground bunker. Difficulty increases over time as more bombs fall from above. Use power-ups to stay alive as long as you can. Unlock levels as you save more innocents. Responsive twin stick controls on gamepad (recommended) or use keyboard and mouse. DEVELOPER NOTES Please note that Martian Law is a small game. It is not a massive, content-heavy experience. Our goal was to create a fun, addicting, score-chaser arcade game. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. Your satisfaction and feedback are very important to us. Thank you for your support!",
