    "About the game": "Mazed and Bemused is a maze game, but it is also a puzzle game. Players direct an avatar through a series of mazes. Each maze differs in size, theme, and difficulty. As they maneuver the maze, players search for clues to a puzzle. Each puzzle goes along with the theme of the associated maze. Each puzzle also differs in type and complexity. The clues could lead to a four digit combination that will be needed to exit the maze. A few of the puzzles are easy, but some are down-right difficult. This game was meant to be both entertaining and challenging.",
