    "About the game": "Mindless monsters roam the depths of the Undercity - a hostile, sprawling, interconnected, semi-open-world environment. Nakawak (a skeleton comprised of an odd assortment of bones) is unique. He has had an awakening. He has found a sense of self. Alone in a hostile world filled with monstrous beings, Nakawak knows his purpose: Defeat the Three Beasts and the Seal will fail, opening the way to the surface and freedom . . . Explore! Power Up! Escape! NAKAWAK is a retro game displaced in time. Features: Fully exploreable, semi-open-world environment! A simple in-game map that is great for course correcting without spoiling the adventure and surprises! A dark, minimalist storyline told through few words and memorable set pieces! Expanded content to extend playtime! Simple, GameBoy style chiptune soundtrack! Nearly 20 upgrades and powerups to procure! A broad and wild bestiary of creatures to exterminate! Three huge bosses to battle, each more challenging than the last! Crawl through tight, winding tunnels with NAKAWAK's quadruped form!",
