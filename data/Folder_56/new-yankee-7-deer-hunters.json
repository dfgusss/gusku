    "About the game": "Pursue a snow-white deer through an enchanted forest and discover a magical mystery in the days of King Arthur! When the legendary ruler summons Sir John and Mary to complete another quest for him, they reluctantly leave their modern-day ranch and prepare for another sword-swinging, magic-casting adventure. But nothing they have experienced has prepared them for what they will face as they track a strange creature who's on a pressing quest of its own! To keep up with the fleet-footed deer, the player must work quickly to gather and produce resources, repair bridges and buildings, remove obstacles, and complete quests for characters that range from wildly wicked to crazily comical. There's never a dull moment as the player races against the clock to complete challenging levels, unlock bonuses, and earn achievements. For players who want a relaxed experience, an untimed mode is available that will take them on the same incredible journey. Answer the call of a king and begin the hunt today! Key features: • An adventurous, fun-filled story! • Vibrant worlds and captivating characters! • Simple but challenging gameplay! • Three magical mini-games! • An untimed mode for kids and casual players!",
