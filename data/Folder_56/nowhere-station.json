    "About the game": "As a Station flies into a mysterious nebula, most of robots go insane - they unite into cults worshiping Perfection, or unknown God, or Great Toaster, whatever. The less sense it makes - the better. Some robots however were on maintaince, so they stayed normal. You take control of one of such machines and try to take down these robo-cults before they ruin the Station and get us all vanished for good. You can only move from wall to wall , so plan your maneuvers while shooting mad cans. Find the equipment to shoot big bad ball of whatever kills the enemies, or just keeps you a few seconds longer in your struggle.",
