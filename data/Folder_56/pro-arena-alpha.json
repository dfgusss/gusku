    "Name": "Pro Arena Alpha",
    "Release date": "Nov 15, 2021",
    "About the game": "Due to a organization of personal attacks that was launched against our name, and our own attempt as the Developers to make a soft launch to build a playerbase from zero, thus making us vulnerable to such a thing due to a lack of budget to create a strong presence via upfront marketing, we decided to shut down this store page. We will be re-releasing this Arena FPS in the near future. It should be noted that despite the apparent negative reviews which straight out lied about things that anyone who actually played the game could acknowledge weren't true, these messages were sent to discredit our name from those who had a vendetta against us from things completely outside the realm of our game itself. We actually had several FPS Professionals send us direct emails with extremely positive reviews about our core engine mechanics, claiming Synergy as a incredible Arena Shooter saying things precisely like, 'Great job! This game is better than Halo: Infinite, Apex Legends, Battlefield 2042, Overwatch, and pretty much everything else out there! We look forward to the full release'. We extend our thanks to those who did show their support and gratitude for our movement to revive a strong presence of Arena FPS in the market again. We will return soon!",
