You are dead and you have no body parts. No eyes. No ears. Not even legs. Step 2 You have a very limited amount of life force. You can only go so far and jump so high. Before you die collect as much gold as possible. Step 3 Use the gold that you collected and buy your body parts back. When you buy eyes you get color vision. When you get your ears you can hear. If you want to run further you buy a longer health meter. SIDE NOTE: There are no microtransactions or IAP! Step 4 As you upgrade your corpse you can get further and further.
