    "About the game": "Welcome, Commander, to our Universe! Two hundred years after the colonial wars from Sirius Online , both factions have determined themselves to start exploring for newer, better options to colonize the universe. Earth and, in conclusion the Terran Forces have exploring the outer rims of the galactic arm, trying to find artifacts of other species to be used in the war efforts, with the Colonies seek contact towards the core of the galaxy. Time upon time both have clashed upon each other, but only the invention of the Jumpgate-Technology made this recent expansion possible. Now you can be an independent pilot under the banner of one of these factions and seek out the treasures the universe has to offer yourself! Connect your Game with your twitch.tv stream, and play Sirius: Age of the free Agents with your Viewers! They can send you help or make your life harder - it is their decision, and might even help you uncover your true potential. Any Event Calamity can be new and have game-changing effects on you or your adversaries. The Twitch integration is optional and Sirius: Age of the Free Agents does not require a twitch.tv account to play. Sirius: Age of the Free Agents is more like a fast paced late 90s Shooter. Dive headfirst into combat, shoot what moves and hope you will survive. Play in your own pace and embrace the wild and unbound combat in the local Star Cluster! Save freighters from pirates, engage in the massive battlefields where the factions clash or just drift around and search for the riches beyond. Your playstyle defines the pace. The Age of the Free Agents always progresses with time and you will get more and more of a Storyline, delivered in Episodic Updates. These are fully voice acted and may contain tasks, easy and hard. Get to know a cast of diverse and colorful characters, from the charismatic Film Noir-inspired space cowboy Kyle Burnert, to the former terran POW and now Admiral Karen Gull. Released Storylines: Follow the trail of your faction leaders, discovering an strange new stargate appearing. Uncover the mystery of a strange unknown force, which can disable jump capable ships in one quick shot, and get to know the cast of characters. Upcoming Storylines: To be announced.",
