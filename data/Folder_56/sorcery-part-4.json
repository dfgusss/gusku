A bold step away from the confines of the source material, and a coherent and completely novel experience.' - Rock Paper Shotgun 'Sorcery! 3 is unlike anything you’ve ever played. Its mix of puzzle-solving, combat, and choose-your-own-adventure stylings have created a unique form of entertainment that I cannot wait to get back into' - Pocket Tactics, 5/5 '[One] of 2015’s best iPhone games', TIME magazine 'This dragon-centric chapter of Sorcery! 3 does a fantastic job of keeping things dynamic and interesting, and better yet, its new puzzle-like aspect gives it the kind of magical, surprise-filled, combat-related fun fantasy fans live for.' - Examiner, 5/5 THE STORY The Crown of Kings has been stolen by the Archmage, and he intends to use it to decimate the Old World. You have been sent, alone, to break into the Citadel of Mampang and get it back. Armed with only a sword, a book of spells, and your wits, you must make your way through the mountains, into the Fortress, through the city within and finally locate the Archmage himself. If you are discovered, it will mean certain death - but sometimes even death can be overcome... From the creators of TIME's Game of the Year 2014, '80 Days', comes the final instalment in the acclaimed Steve Jackson's Sorcery! series. An interactive story told through thousands of choices, all of which are remembered, where no two adventures are the same. Part 4 can be played on its own as a complete stand-alone adventure, or players can load their games from Part 3 to continue the narrative where they left off. Adapted and expanded from the million-selling gamebook series by legendary game designer Steve Jackson, co-founder of Lionhead Studios (with Peter Molyneux) and co-creator of Fighting Fantasy and Games Workshop (with Ian Livingstone). Using inkle's unique inklewriter technology, the story is written in real-time, built around your choices and actions.
