    "About the game": "Soul Valley is a survival, text-reading, treasure hunting, story rich, walking simulator game. Your character, Abigail, comes this valley after her mother gives her a photograh of this place before she dies. She wants you to find something piece by piece. With each piece, you solve puzzles and find out the truth about your father. Main gameplay is focused on treasure hunting. You try to find pieces from the maps your mother left in the valley. Every map leads you to a piece of a puzzle and a note from your mother. Another part of the gameplay is survival. You try to not starve or die from thirst. You loot wood pieces to light a fire, you boil your water, you scavenge abandoned sheds for food or eat local flora.",
