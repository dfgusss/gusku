He is incredibly skilled in close quarters combat, robust, violent, and has a variety of physical attacks to crush any resistance. A water type overlord, Terbang is equipped with gravity emitters that allow her to float. While the fastest overlord, her attacks are not as strong as her brothers. She uses projectiles to attack and is able to charge her attack to create a massive power attack. One of the strongest overlords, Phemus does not travel at high speeds, but due to his four arms is able to deal massive damage at close range. A hulking walking armour with two massive arms and tentacle-like protuberances as hair, he has a devastating spin attack which can be incredibly dangerous combined with a boost at the right time.
