    "About the game": "Space Rescue is made for the BOOOM , a GameJam holded by GCORES. About This Game The precious Energy Spinels've been stolen! Players will navigate a tiny spaceship to slip into the puzzle where the Energy Spinels hidden. They have to glide up and down, avoiding a series of obstrucles, and eventually carry the Spinels back to their mother planet. As a casual puz-act, 《Space Rescue》isn't complicated to handle, just control '←'+'→' with switching several skills Spinels given to. To be worthy of attention, navigating a spaceship is not similar to driving a car——you might lose the sense of direction! Come and get the Energy Spinels back ~ Words From the Developers Thank you all for your support of our game. This work was born from a Game Jam we participated in after work, due to the limited level, the game itself has many shortcomings. However, with the advice of some friends, we decided to put this game on Steam for free so that more players can play our game. We are currently working on a puzzle game 'Line Time' in our spare time, which is expected to be available on Steam later. (You can search this game in Itch.io) However, due to the limited time of developers and development, the progress is very slow at the moment, and we hope that the subsequent development can be successfully completed. Finally, thank you again for liking and supporting our game ~",
