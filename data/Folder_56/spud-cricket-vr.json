    "About the game": "Born from 2 mates drinking beers, watching cricket, and believing they could do better than the overpaid Aussie spuds currently doing the rounds in world cricket, Spud Cricket VR is a Virtual Reality cricket game for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Play 5,10 OR 20 overs against a mate, 1 innings at a time. Simple fun, slog it hard, casual cricket game. You will love smacking the bowler over the fence as you try to be the next Davey Warner! But you wont. Your a spud. Might get a game for Australia though... Features include: - Single or local multiplayer modes - 3 types of matches - 5, 10 or 20 over match. - 3 difficulty levels. - Use of the HTC Vive hand controller for realistic batting action. - Bat either left or right handed. - The bat has a sweet spot. Time those shots for the runs. Haptic feedback will tell the story. - AI fielders that adjust to your big shots. - Not all batters were born equal. As you go down the batting list, so does the skill of your batters. - Customisable line, length and speed for the bowler player in local multiplayer - Suprise your friend batting with a sudden slower delivery or a yorker. - Double up with fielding customisation in local multiplayer - dont just bowl it different, plan your fielding setup as well and entice the batter into the big hit, only to get caught. - In game crowd noise and reaction to shots, wickets and other moments. - Scoreboards both in game and for the desktop with detailed batter information. - Multiple views for Batter and bowler. - Action replays! You can repeatedly watch the big 6 you just smashed off your friends bowling! - Money for nothing and your runs for free? Hit the hovering target for free runs!",
