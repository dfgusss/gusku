    "About the game": "TankDestruction is a fast-paced multiplayer action game. Equip the abilities you wish to use, and join the battle on large-scale maps with up to 20 other players! To win, capture the towers controlled by the enemy team - but be careful, as they are protected by powerful AI-controlled turrets which have to be destroyed first. Spend too long destroying them, and enemy tiger tanks will start to swarm all over you - they enjoy derping around, but they'll destroy you all the same! When duelling other players, you rely on your speed to survive, so try not to crash into a tree! You'll look a bit silly (and a bit helpless) if you do. TankDestruction is free to play. For those who wish to support the game, there is an option to purchase a premium account which provides cosmetic bonuses only , such as being able to equip different skins. Controls: Use WASD to move. Left click to fire the main gun - this is your long-range weapon. Right click to fire the machine guns - these guns are only effective at short range. Use the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 buttons to activate your special abilities. Hold the W key if your tank is stuck upside-down. Protips: Destroy two or more turrets before attacking the tower. Driving faster will allow you to dodge bullets. Your bullets will automatically lock onto the closest target near the centre of your screen.",
