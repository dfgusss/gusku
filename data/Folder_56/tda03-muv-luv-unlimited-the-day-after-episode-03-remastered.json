    "About the game": "Lieutenant Tatsunami Hibiki has done the impossible. Just when war between the remaining countries on Earth seemed inevitable, he risked life and limb to secure a truce — and succeeded. A peace conference is scheduled to take place in Seattle, and for the first time in months, it seems there might be a light at the end of the tunnel for the warring nations of humanity. But as the good Lieutenant would soon discover, it was too early to claim victory. France — now relocated to Canada and suffering from widespread famine — has been plotting all along against Japan and the United States. With control over the world's remaining nuclear arsenal, the French are now ready and willing to impose peace by force — on their own terms. And if that weren't bad enough, the BETA have built a Hive on the Western Hemisphere, which is growing with terrifying speed! Facing threats from both our fellow man and the alien invaders, can Hibiki succeed in bringing the world together in a final effort against our true enemy before it’s too late?",
