    "About the game": "BRAZILIAN PROJECT! Why isn't a game in development free? As this is a project of only 1 person, taking care of the entire process of creating the game, all the money raised from the sale of the game will be converted into resources for the game, such as sprite-type images, animations, tiles, sounds and music . Your contribution will help a lot even if the amount is small. Thanks to all lovers of the INDIE, MMORPG category and who sponsor Brazilian games. Become a sponsor and help me invest more and more in improvements, ideas and make the game more and more complete! As my idea is to make a game other than Pay 2 Win, I will not profit from the game's transactions, I will invest in improvements. I'm counting on you! : heart: Join Us! Become a sponsor [/] The Celtos is the rebellion of angels and demons that formed a strong rift, allowing the passage between the three worlds, which are in constant war against humans on earth. Humans received an energy released from the two kingdoms, acquiring supernatural powers, forming some heroes, and others ... no, you decide which side you are on. Your objective is to survive in this war, always seeking wisdom, to face the two kingdoms and restore the peace that had existed. The Celtos brings you the nostalgia of being able to venture into a world with your friends, where you will encounter beings from all existing mythologies. You can choose from classes of magic, body-to-body and distance. Our focus is to do something fair, without pay to win, which today is widely used in multiplayer games. We are influenced by Ragnarok, Tibia, Mu, Zelda style games. Frequent updates will come bringing more and more news and gameplay. In it you will find: Quests / Daily System; Class System; PvP and Groups System; Friendship System; Night / Day System; Boss system; Item Rarity System; And also, every basic MMORPG system. So, will you come with us for this great adventure and be part of our history?",
