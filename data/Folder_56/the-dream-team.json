    "About the game": "The people of reality are falling into permanent slumber, never being able to wake up. With the help of the Dream Witch Poppy, Fruit, Rob, and Blue will enter the Dream Realm, a space where all dreams converge. There they will enter the dreams of their friends and try to wake them up from the inside. Join our heroes as they save many familiar faces within the Dream Realm. Return to reality to spend time with friends, record content, and gear up for your next adventure! The more people you save, the more you can weaken the gate at the end of the Dream Realm to get inside and strike down whoever or whatever is putting people into permanent sleep.",
