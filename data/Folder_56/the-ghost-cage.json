    "About the game": "Isabel's just moved into a new home, but it turns out it's haunted by a ghost! Should she be afraid? Or should she try to be nice to the ghost and befriend it? Or maybe she could even turn the tables on it and drive it out of the house! The outcome of this short and light-hearted adventure game depends on the items you find and the choices you make. Multiple endings - which may be happy, sad, heartwarming, or amusing - available. Playtime About 20-30 minutes for one playthrough. Notes This is not a horror game, though it was made for the horror-themed Spooktober Spooktacular Game Jam (where it won 1st place). The game has a ghost and a couple of allusions to death. The idea of a ghost whose reaction to you depends on how you treat it and a couple scenes in this game were loosely inspired by The Canterville Ghost by Oscar Wilde.",
