You have been selected to accompany an ambassador to the city of Roche Divine in the Sunlight Alliance. While he pursues trade deals in the high court, your job is to hunt down a Broadsheet Killer who is wreaking havoc in the Low City. A choose your own adventure novel in which your choices and actions can lead you to glorious victory...or ignoble defeat. Explore an original story with three challenging game difficulties, unlock hidden lore to better understand the world you enter, and enjoy the artwork you discover in the gallery. This independently produced novel features a dark soundtrack (with optional atmospherics) by Cryo Chamber, as well as over 40 unique page images to unlock.
