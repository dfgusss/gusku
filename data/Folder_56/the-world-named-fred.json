    "About the game": "In this first-person action-adventure game you play from behind the eyes of Leet Nym, who, at the request of a cat calling itself Mr. Snuggles, embarks on a quest to save an obscenely magical world named Fred. The game features: A 3D world populated by a variety of mythical creatures (chupacabras, vampires, zombies, hippies, et cetera). Slapsticky sword combat. Comic book style interactive conversations that tell a story strong enough to bind together all the crazy. A highly polished, minimalist interface.",
