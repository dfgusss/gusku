    "About the game": "It's Cyber Warfare... Turn-Based Strategy Style ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue is an educational game-based cybersecurity simulator designed for those with genuine interest in cybersecurity . Learn and practice cybersecurity concepts &amp; strategy, play as the red team (hackers) or the blue team (defenders), single player or online vs. a colleague. NOTE : ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue is not designed to be a “game” meant strictly for entertainment. It is a game-based (or gamified) cybersecurity simulator designed for educational purposes. Therefore, it might be very challenging for some people, and common “gameplay” or 'quality of life' features might also be absent or different than one might expect from a standard gaming experience. Learn and Practice Real-World Cybersecurity Concepts and Strategy! ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue was created by experienced, professional (ethical) 'hackers' and penetration testers and is designed to help you learn real-world cybersecurity methods and strategies! Learn how hackers think, operate, and attack systems by playing the part of the red team (no prior skills necessary)! Play the part of the blue team and learn about real cybersecurity controls, technology, methods, and strategies! Sharpen your cybersecurity knowledge and skills by seeing the 'big picture', how everything works together in a broader strategy. ( HINT : This is a challenging game/simulation. So, if you are a beginner, be sure to check out the game guide and reference the in-game wiki! We have purposefully left out a lot of 'hand holding' that the typical 'gamer' might expect.) GAME GUIDE: -Red-vs-Blue-Guide-1.10.pdf Game Play ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue is a turn-based strategy game played much like popular global domination board games. Rather than a world map, the 'game board' consists of a computer network, which players compete for control over. No technical skill is required to play. Instead of simulated computer terminals and computer code, players choose and commit actions using the action menu, similar to a skill tree used in many other computer and console games. NOTE: ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue does not simulate command line skills and techniques. This is a 'point-and-click' style simulation. It is designed to help players learn and exercise cybersecurity concepts and strategies. The simulation is very detailed, but not technical. By the Community... For the Community Every single member of the development team for this game actually comes from the cybersecurity (or INFOSEC) community. Most of us work, or have worked, for years as cybersecurity professionals, and we all remain active members of the community. Developers Clint Bodungen and Aaron Shbeeb are authors of the book, Hacking Exposed: Industrial Control Systems . ThreatGEN: Red vs. Blue was developed and tested as a result of the feedback from more than 300 beta testers in the cybersecurity community. Our goal is to continue to make regular updates based on continued feedback, making this truly a game by the community, for the community.
