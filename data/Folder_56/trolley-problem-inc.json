    "About the game": "There is a runaway trolley careering down the railway tracks. On the tracks are five people unable to move. You are next to a lever. If you pull this lever the trolley will switch to a different set of tracks. However, you notice that there is a person on the other track. Watch the situation play out and five people die. Choose to pull the lever and only one person gets killed - but by you. What will you do? And that’s just for starters. Trolley Problem, Inc. is a darkly comedic narrative game based on real world philosophical papers, in which you are asked to make a series of impossible choices from two awful answers. Wrestle with your moral compass, decide the fate of millions – and then see how your choices compare to the rest of the world. * A tightly-wound, two-hour narrative experience. * Questions are based on genuine philosophical papers, complete with references. * It’s you vs The Narrator as every decision you make is challenged. * Compare your choices with other players. * Full Twitch integration - let your audience help guide your decisions Trolley Problem, Inc. is a brilliant, challenging, uncomfortable, comedic game from Samuel Read-Graves, the executive producer of Gang Beasts. What will you do?",
