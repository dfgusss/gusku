    "About the game": "You crash on a small island, where you need to get your first food and build shelter. Beware, there are many dangers on the islands. Build, explore, and survive. The world of the game is quite vast. A few islands surrounding the beginning, including those that are extremely unfriendly to you, but with some benefits that you will not find on others. Not every plant and every animal is positive towards you. Your statistics are growing by practice. The more often we cut a tree, the faster we cut it. The more often we receive injuries, the more we become resistant to them over time. Animals and 'Others' also have such a possibility. Keep this in mind and be careful of decisions.",
