    "About the game": "Story After the invention and uncontrolled use of nuclear weapons at the end of World War II, humanity almost destroyed itself in endless conflicts. Dust eclipsed the sun, and global warming caused all the glaciers to melt. The remnants of the scarred land turned the ocean into a muddy slush, in which the evolutionary process began under the influence of radiation. In the poisonous water, a parasite appeared that mutated almost all living things. But there were people who managed to survive in this nightmare and adapt. In the vast expanses of the Black Ocean, they built many platforms where they worked and survived. What used to be used for war has become a bulwark of life. Ships and submarines became the main travel arteries. The main character of the game — the last survivor on his platform, he is seriously ill, but decides to leave his station, and go on a submarine to other platforms, along the way trying to help other survivors and find the way to salvation and healing.
