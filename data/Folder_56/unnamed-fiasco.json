    "About the game": "An epic battle between an old lady with a moustache and a lucha libre baby fighter is about to unfold. Unnamed Fiasco is a competitive local multiplayer game where your mistakes can actually help you. Every time your character dies during a match, a new clone is created to help you by repeating your past lives movements and actions. Hit piñatas to collect power-ups and face the minute madness that completely changes the match flow. Fight on top of an old Mayan temple, a crowded bullring, a laboratory with deadly lasers and more. Face your friends on intense couch multiplayer matches or go solo on tons of action-puzzle challenges with online leaderboards. Key Features 2-4 players local multiplayer: Play locally with up to 4 players on various multiplayer modes. Multiplayer modes: Face your friends on the multiplayer modes that include Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Dog Tag, Treasure Hunt and Police Chase. Multiplayer maps: Play on 24 multiplayer maps across six different map themes, including Temple, Bullring, Laboratory, Daycare and more. Singleplayer challenges: Face more than 40 singleplayer challenges that will require both skill, fast-thinking and puzzle-solving. Let your past lives help you: Everytime you die, a clone is created to help you by repeating you past lives movements and actions. Plan ahead and use it in your advantage. Collect items to increase your winning changes: Weapon jammers, jetpacks, mines, golden guns, shields and many more items are available to help you face your opponents. It's time for a minute madness: To add some spice, minute madness randomly enables match modifiers such as low/high gravity, inverted controls, grenade rain, noir/pixelated/blurry vision, and more. This can greatly change the matches' pacing and turn the battle in your advantage (or against you!). An unique character roster: Play as an old lady with a moustache, a raging bull, a lucha-libre baby fighter, a hipster robot or a charming bull fighter.",
