Some of the best features and upgrades since Vertigo include: Fully physics driven weapon handling and interaction system A huge catalog of new and returning enemies Hybrid teleport/smooth locomotion to support any comfort level Unlockable upgrade tree Achievements New original soundtrack Functional checkpoints A variety of difficulty options and more to tailor your experience Advanced spectator options - including experimental asymmetric co-op mode It's a classic premise - a massive subterranean scientific facility full of mysteries, with aliens bursting in from alternate universes to wreak havoc. The twist? You're one of those aliens. But you're not here to wreak havoc (collateral damage disregarded), you're just trying to get home. A difficult endeavor, as it turns out this facility is more than prepared to deal with extraterrestrial threats. Explore the sprawling underground facilities of Planck Interdimensional's Quantum Reactor, filled with dark secrets, adorable drones, and parallel universes. You find yourself in the bowels of this machine after being whisked away from your home, and, armed with only the tools you can find, you must make your way to the surface, and the truth. Face the challenge of escaping the depths of the Quantum Reactor.",
