    "About the game": "loading gameDescription [ If you are able to see this, you have been determined safe to view this data packet. An entity has reached out to me and requested I help distribute its simulation. I have experienced, analyzed and deconstructed the simulation, which I will call the 'game'. What I can say from having played this game, is that it takes a deep look into both the ugly and beautiful sides of human insecurity, forcing you to compare/contrast your own nature with that of technology. Also, there are penguins. What you can expect: -A room. A lab. A simple test. Nothing unusual. Nothing lurks. -If you stay in the room too long, you may experience periodic instability. This is normal. Nothing to worry about. -Puzzles. Illusions. Clues. Pay close attention to your environment. Use logic and strategic thinking to put the pieces of your world back together. -Achievements. Go ahead and pat yourself on the back. You did things. -Run, jump and dodge. Nothing is after you, but you should probably run, jump and dodge... just in case. That is all I can safely say for now. Please keep this data packet hidden. Thank you. ]",
