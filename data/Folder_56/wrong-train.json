    "Release date": "Jan 5, 2022",
    "About the game": "Have you ever had such a thing that you forgot yourself from fatigue and got into the wrong transport that you need? What if you got on the wrong train that you were waiting for and fell asleep, and woke up to find that there are no people around anywhere else, and the train itself is endless? Will you be able to return home? Wrong train is a hardcore psychological thriller from the first person in which you have to try to return to your world from the place you got to. Key Features: 1) The train is really endless! 2) Items on the train have random generation. 3) Items and monsters at stations also have random generation. 4) You are limited in time at the stops, and the light at the stations is only from your flashlight. The minimum time to complete the game is about 60 minutes. But it all depends on how you distribute the resources found. Warning: Epileptic seizures associated with increased sensitivity to light are possible. Some people may experience seizures when exposed to flashes of light and flashing images that appear in video games. People who have not experienced such attacks before may not be aware of their illness.",
