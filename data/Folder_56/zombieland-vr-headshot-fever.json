    "About the game": "** VR Game of the Year finalist at the 2021 TIGA Awards ** ** VR Game of the Year finalist at the 2021 VR Awards ** ** Winner of 'Best Small Studio 2021' at the 2021 TIGA Awards ** The award-winning ‘Zombieland VR: Headshot Fever’ is an arcade light gun racing shooter built for VR. Headshot combos slow the clock, meaning the most precise shooter is the fastest. This gives you more time to rack up combos, get faster times and claw your way to the top of the leaderboards with awesome weapons, powerful upgrades and head-popping, clock-stopping, zombie-killing arcade action! Taking inspiration from games outside of shooters such as Trackmania, a course takes no longer than a minute, but it will hold your attention for hours as you shave your time, millisecond by millisecond, until you get close to perfection. It's score-chasing heaven!
