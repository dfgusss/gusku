    "Name": "A tractor",
    "Release date": "Aug 15, 2018",
    "About the game": "An old-fashioned, semi-serious, social-economic simulation and galactic world construction game combining trading, vehicles, mini-games and blowing things up, which also gives the dedicated few the opportunity to make their own games within the wider universe. In its basic form, your goal is to live a long life and get rich. Starting from a persistent game-world that evolves while you're not playing, and then outwards into other places where what you need to do varies depending on what other players are doing and what has been built in the past. Often things unfold slowly over the course of many weeks and months - not a game to play in a single long session, instead you'd visit occasionally, exploring the universe and collecting money you've earned while you were offline.",
