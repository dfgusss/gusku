If not you can always hit the reset button and try again and again. There is no reason to be worried this is a place for fun and learning before a few deaths had occurred in and around the property. You play as a night security guard trying to survive in this hunted building until the bell rings in the morning. You only have access to Cameras and a flashlight. You will need to listen for the monsters walking around in the night. You can go to the doors to hear if someone is outside your door you have to close it before it gets in. You have Dolly, her imaginary haunted friends the Jester &amp; more. They all want a piece of you.",
