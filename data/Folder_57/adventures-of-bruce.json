    "Release date": "Nov 23, 2020",
    "About the game": "This is a fantasy-themed match 3 / jigsaw puzzle mashup. Players that like match 3 blast games, may appreciate a different take on match 3. You are not merely collecting, but also attempting to solve for a pretty pattern. It has input accessibility and difficulty settings which can make the experience not only accessible, but therapeutic (the easiest setting). This game can be played with keyboard only, or game-pad only (2 button mode supported), or of course with touch or mouse. Breaking up the levels is a story about Bruce and his lacklustre adventures. It also has a built-in traditional match 3 level designer and a non-random one.",
