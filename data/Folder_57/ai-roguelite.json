    "About the game": "ATTENTION: This game requires a high-end NVIDIA GPU (does not work with AMD); please check the system requirements before buying. If you do not have an NVIDIA GPU, you can try the smallest model (125M) using the CPU, but it will be more like a fever dream than a cohesive story. Introducing AI Roguelite, the world's first text-based RPG where every location, NPC, enemy, item, and crafting recipe is generated completely from scratch by artificial intelligence. Describe your starting universe (e.g. 'underwater city'), and the AI will figure out the rest. AI-generated entities: What weapons might you find in an underwater city? Which enemies might you find? Where else can you go from there? All these questions are answered by the GPT technology running on your GPU, so you can explore a truly infinite world. AI-generated crafting recipes: What item could you make if combining a wooden stick with a rock? What about a computer chip with a zombie brain? The AI decides which item should be produced, based on the names of the ingredients. AI-generated combat: What happens when you try to attack a 'terminator robot' with a 'raw salmon'? There are no traditional item stats. Instead, whether an attack is successful depends entirely on its AI-generated name and description. The AI then generates a plausible set of events following what happens when you use it as a weapon against the enemy. Finally, the AI is fed its own story, from which it tries to figure out whether the enemy was killed, injured, or unharmed. AI-generated illustrations: Every entity gets an illustration generated by VQGAN-CLIP technology running on your GPU. Each image takes 30-60 seconds to complete, but the game can still be played while they're being generated.",
