    "About the game": "Rewrite history and rule Ancient Egypt in this retro-inspired city-building game. You have to construct prospering cities alongside The Nile. Evolve households to higher levels by providing them goods and services. Design and beautify complex cities. Defend your empire from invading armies. A small shortage of goods or an overlooked district might bring your city to ruins. Features: Walker system: Instead of an area of effect, the base of the game is focused on the so-called walker system. The majority of the buildings have to be connected with roads, over which your people will move. You will have to design city districts so that all the buildings receive goods and services in time. Service walkers will provide goods and services to houses. Delivery walkers will retrieve resources from storage and deliver them to producers. Military units that you can move freely around the map. The paths of road walkers can be controlled by placing roadblocks or setting their custom paths manually. Housing: The heart of the city are the people. Evolve your households by providing them with goods and services. The better living conditions, the more people can be housed. Currently, there are 15 housing levels. Elite Housing: Elite class does not work, but they are an important part of your empire. Satisfying them will be harder as they want more luxurious items and an appealing area to live in. Currently, there are 5 elite housing levels. Resources and goods: Currently, there are 25 goods available, which can be harvested, mined, bought, or produced. Often you will have to use all of those methods, as not all maps provide you with everything you need from the beginning. The Nile: The Nile floods once a year, during that time it is not possible to grow crops and any structures that were placed over floodplains will be destroyed. (except for roads and farms) Services: In addition to providing your people with goods, you will also have to provide them with access to religious facilities, doctors, courthouses, entertainment, and others. Risks: You will have to make sure that all the buildings are well maintained. If they are not, they could collapse or set on fire. Additionally, people can get sick. If that happens, their houses will be burned to prevent the disease from spreading. Make sure there are enough apothecaries in your city. Trade: Buy and sell resources and goods through land or water trade. Without a solid economy, your city will not survive. Taxes: Your people have to be paid, military upkeep is expensive. Tax your people for the extra income. Religion: Worship ancient deities and enjoy the benefits that they provide. You can choose worshipped god once per map and each one has a different effect. Choose wisely! Beautification: You can decorate your city with gardens, statues, pillars, and more. Desirability: The elite wants to live in an appealing place. You will have to beautify their surrounding for them to evolve. Monuments: Construct obelisks, mastabas, stone/limestone/smooth pyramids. Each monument requires different resources to be created. You will have to harvest the resources yourself or if your location does not provide them, import. Pyramids come in various sizes. The bigger ones will need more resources and time to be finished. Military: Build walls, towers, and gates. Produce or import weapons. Recruit and control legions. Defend your city from invaders. Workforce management: You can prioritize which industries will receive workers first. If there are not enough people in your city it might happen that for example architects won't have enough workers. And a city without architects will soon stop being a city. Overview system: You can view current levels of risks or services provided by using the overview system. This will help you spot parts of the city that need to be worked on and prevent disasters from happening. Kingdom requests: You will have to fulfill kingdom requests on time. If you will not do it, your reputation will suffer. Music: Enjoy nearly an hour of Egyptian styled music composed with love specifically for this game. There are 17 tracks to listen to. Map Editor: Create custom maps and share them on Steam Workshop. The map editor is evolving with the game and more features are being added. There is an official Steam Guide on using the Map Editor. Modding: Tweak settings of units and buildings or add new ones to the game. Access and modify files easily. Are you skilled enough to rule Ancient Egypt?
