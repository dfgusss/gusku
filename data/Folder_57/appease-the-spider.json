    "About the game": "You play an introverted paranoid block-head, having just installed cameras all throughout your home because of the gub'ment. You can monitor these cameras regardless of where you are with a handy dandy digital pad that you carry at all times. This preparation ends up helping you in ways you never expected, as you dart from room to room, checking the cameras to make sure that the coast is clear between areas. You desperately run throughout the house, picking up whatever items HE asked for without question. Suddenly you hear the sound of a ghost roaring from behind... you run, open the door to your bedroom and hide beneath the bed... Checking your cameras, you notice that you shook the ghost and it is now in the room next door. You take a deep breath to calm your nerves and crawl out from the bed to try again.",
