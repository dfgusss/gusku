    "About the game": "Made on a budget of 0 dollars, Ball Bounce Maze is an independent game made by an amateur developer. Simply put, it is a randomized physics-based puzzle game. The objective is to use bouncers to make the ball hit the target while avoiding the obstacles, walls, ceiling, or floor. Easy? No! Having different ways to score makes this game as long or short as you want it. Shortest time. Longest time. Most bounces. There are a billion playing fields, but you can spend all night on just one trying to get a better score in just one category. Post a video of your result and compare it to others’ results. Show your work, or no one will believe you. Place and rotate the bouncers: To bounce the ball: To avoid the obstacles: To eventually hit the target at the bottom after bouncing around a lot. Young kids just like to watch the ball bounce around. Older kids and adults go for best scores.",
