    "About the game": "Peppe : Now that we shared so many memories, how about a little kiss? Secretary : Nice try. But you need to go now before I regret helping you! This is Peppe making is way through Italian politics. Later he will try and repay his boss’s secretary with 'bunga bunga' services. He is: •Lazy •A hood •A Mama’s boy •Pretty dumb •A loser. His goals: •Does he want to save the world from the Martians? Well, no. He is for peace, man. And interstellar wars are way too dangerous. •Perhaps he prefers rescuing a damsel from a gorilla? No. That sounds like a lot of work. •Really sure that he doesn't want to rescue a beautiful damsel with long, blinking, eyelashes? Definitely not. Gorillas tend to get annoyed when you do that. And she's probably a pain in the ass. •Then, maybe, he will help the dark side of the Force to prevail? Neither. He can't breathe that hard. Not even on the phone. All in all, he just wants to please his mama. Will he eventually please her? Will he be successful? Will he prove he is not just a bum, full of promises but weak in character as Mama says all the time? Well... that, my friend, kind of depends on you. Born in the twisted mind of the Fazz Brothers, Belpaese: Homecoming is the first chapter of an old style, irony-oriented, trick-driven, Point &amp; Click Graphic Adventure. If you: •Are one of these old CGA geeks mourning the golden era of videogames. •Think of yourself as a brilliant example of the sparkling new generation of problem solvers (how cheeky). •Are not scared by lateral thinking, actually excited about parading your imagination and your ability to live through tough times. If all the above points, or even just one of them, applies to you, then, my travel companion, this is your game. Have a Great Adventure! Vote for Peppe! Technical Specifications: •2D Point and Click Graphic Adventure Game. •Playable in English and Italian. •Graphic Adventure Game with more than 2 characters, but less than 1000. •Graphic Adventure Game with day and night locations. •4 hours game (on average).",
