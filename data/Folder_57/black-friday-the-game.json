    "About the game": "Black Friday sales are book-size topic. Some of us love them, some hate. If u hate a climate of crowded shopping center or you just want to feel the thrill of sales you don't need to get up from your PC. Just relax, sit down comfortable and play Black Friday: The Game! Game Features: Procedural and endless level generation Different enemies with different behaviours Roguelike style Large variety of rooms Controller support Ketchup is your weapon! Like on the real Sale - In Black Friday: The Game you need to be real man Like Julius Cesar, you need to Veni Vidi Vici. You need to go to the shop (All in all you don't, we did it for you) - Veni. Then you should localize product that you want to buy - Vidi. Then run to it (be quick buddy!) and take it to the cash desk. When cash goes green you win - its Vici! Now repeat and repeat until you get run out of money (don't worry in this game you are really, really rich) or until you die.. Wait! What?! Did you said ' die '? Yes i do. It's like in the real life, if you want something very much, there are always people that want you to fail.     You The truly man on the truly hunt - That's you!     Mean Granny She is not so fast and strong, but she has a handbag (The most deadly handbag on the planet - trust me). She even don't want all that goodies, but she don't want you to get them.     Shopping Scooter Guy His big, he is bad, but the most important he is a pacifist. He won't hurt you. Tip: Disturbing isn't hurting.     Muscle Man He is yours worst nightmare. He is bigger and stronger than you, but fortunately he doesn't have a bag.     Babushka Here comes the Babushka. She looks very similar to typical granny, but its only camouflage. Babushka and her bag are way more powerful.     'Lady' It's really difficult to run on the high heels, so she won't catch you. Her bag is too expensive to using it as a weapon. But her dog is such a different story...",
