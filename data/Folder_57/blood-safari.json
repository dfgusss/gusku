    "About the game": "Blood Safari is a fast paced 3rd person shooter in which you will gain no levels, no unlocks, no permanent account upgrades... You just drop in and start slaughtering. Wave after wave of insane safari animals want you dead. Compete with your friends for the high score and just have a good time. Metal music is blasting in the background and animal parts and bodies are flying everywhere. Play with up to 3 friends via LAN or Online via Steam. This game does not pretend to be anything other than mindless (sometimes buggy) fun. It will continue to be added to and improved as time goes on. Blood Safari will have more levels and different animals to kill in those levels. There will never be paid DLC for this game. As I release more content, it will be available to everyone who purchases the game.",
