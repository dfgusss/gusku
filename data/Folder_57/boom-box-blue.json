    "About the game": "Boom Box Blue is a frenzied skill-based physics game. This is what you get if you merge Tetris with physics and throw some bombs into the mix! Play as the hero box and avoid and clear out the constant flow of mean boxes with your bombs, while collecting stars and powerups to level up and upgrade your abilities and compete on the leaderboard. Different kinds of mean boxes are constantly falling from the sky and you have to constantly avoid them while at the same time strategically dropping bombs to best clear up the build up of boxes stacking up on the bottom. Between rounds you can upgrade your abilities to have a better chance of surviving the next round. Different level effects will also come into the mix with events like blowing winds that will push the boxes around or a blackout that will prevent your vision for a time. Collect powerups to do things like slowing down time or shrink your box to have a better chance of survival.",
