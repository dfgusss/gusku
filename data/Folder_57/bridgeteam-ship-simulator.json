    "About the game": "BridgeTeam: Ship Simulator Sail the open ocean or test your skills in docking at busy harbours. Use the radar to show trails and prevent collisions. Bridge Team: Ship Simulator is a ship simulator built from the ground up, and aiming to build on the legacy of the previous ship simulator series (note: we are not affiliated with the previous ship sim devs in any way). Instead of a user manual, we've decided to make a video on basic simulator operations. You can find the link at the bottom of this description. Bridge Team contains: - Highly realistic ships - A fully functioning RADAR with True &amp; Relevant Motion Trails. - Planned features coming soon: EBL, VRM, and Parallel Index lines. - Basic conning screen - Basic autopilot system - NMEA support via TCP/IP protocol - connect to real world ECDIS and other NMEA equipment - NMEA currently supports $GPRMC format. We plan to add other formats too. We can also satisfy any NMEA formats by request. - NMEA currently is via TCP/IP only. - Ocean system with bow and stern wakes - AI ships - Realistic wind/tide effects - Accurate simulation models - ... and much more!
