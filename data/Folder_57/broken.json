    "About the game": "We are not alone, the truth is here... About This Game Broken is an adventure puzzle game that will see you unravel a dark mystery. Storyline Inspired by classic sci-fi literature, film, tv and modern events. Broken interweaves these elements into a compelling and original storyline. The story will introduce you to an unknown force, one far greater than anything we have ever known. You'll understand what they want and why you are being involved. Learn how your arrival was no accident and discover the truths about the meaning of life. The question is... Are you ready to hear the truth? Are you ready to decide the future of mankind? The power will be in your hands! Gameplay Broken is an interactive story, it doesn't hand-hold the player. Like all good sci-fi, you'll interpret the story in your own way, visual clues and set scenes will show you what you need to know without narrating or explaining your experience There's a limited GUI so that you can focus on the story. The only interruption to your visuals will be a reticle when you highlight an object that can be interacted with. There are items to collect throughout the game, again you are not told what they do or when to use them, you must figure that out for yourself. You always have a camera on you to capture your discoveries, from the beauty of the island to the strange and paranormal! You can't die, but you can fail some challenges, if you fail, you'll simply reset at the challenge entry point. Environment Broken's game environment is built with glorious High Definition assets, making the island look and feel realistic, the perfect setting for some sci-fi adventure. From gold beaches, lush forest, underground bunkers to spacecraft the island host a variety of different areas to explore. Lore is scattered across the island waiting to be discovered and interpreted, all of which gives you further insight and understandings of what this island is really about. VR - Coming Soon As part of the beta, VR will soon be unlocked! Step into the island using your VR device, explore the gorgeous visuals and experience the wonders of the island and all the paranormal activity",
