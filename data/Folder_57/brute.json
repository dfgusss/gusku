    "About the game": "Brute is a challenging arcade game with a minimalist aesthetic. It's a game about planning, timing and discovery featuring an atmospheric soundtrack and sounds made from analog synthesizers. Getting through the 25 main stages is a challenge, finishing all 50 is harder but completing all 100 levels will be a true test of skill. For the ultimately insane there's also par times for each level that take into account speed, fuel usage and objects shot. Brute is a game which does not explain itself, encouraging the player to poke at it to see how things react and behave. Game Features: 50 hand crafted levels + 50 'Secret' levels Lots of things to shoot A strange menu with hidden levels and modes Intuitive controls - all you need is a mouse! Lots of music! This is the first game by sound designer Michael Manning (Signal From Tölva, Rogue System, MirrorMoon EP) featuring graphic design and music contributions from Tyler Barber.",
