    "About the game": "ClownZ Update is now available! Clownfield 2042 is an FPS where you take a role of unique soldier, equipped with enough arsenal to fight anyone ahead and win the front. After 2022 crypto-crash caused by NFT's, majority of nations collapsed and a union of 'No-Clowns' has been formed. You are one of them, arm up and get ready for war. ALL OUT CLOWNFARE MULTIPLAYER The next generation of fan favorites All Out Clownfare is here. Experience the most intense fight against real players and highly skilled artificial intelligence with a big variety of arsenal and gorgeous maps. Choose a side or be a lone wolf, the choice is yours. Currently available in 4 game modes (DM, TDM, Domination &amp; Gun Game) with 11 maps, three factions (US, Russia and No-Clowns) and 6 skins per faction. HOVERCRAFT ZONE Why play the game like its meant to be played when you can hop into hovercraft and slay all your enemies? Disrupt the game physics, break the rules of gameplay and enjoy the broken and unoptimized experience ever. CLOWNFIELD GATEWAY Ever dreamed about a gateway where you can be just by yourself? Look no further, our classic gateway mode is making to Clownfield 2042! Set the single player experience to whatever you want it to be, turn the mediocre weather on with ultra-4k-high-poly-big-boom-over-realistc Tornado. Trust me, you (won't) be disappointed. CLOWNFIELD'S FEATURES All Out Clownfare Multiplayer Broken Hovercrafts Scoreboard Voice Chat Text Chat Loadout System OP Shotgun Ear Piercing Flashbangs And much more!
