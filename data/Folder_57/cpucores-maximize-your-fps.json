    "Name": "CPUCores :: Maximize Your FPS",
    "Release date": "Jul 6, 2015",
    "About the game": "CPUCores is a cutting-edge Windows based software built by gamers, specifically for gamers, with 1 thing in mind: INCREASE YOUR FPS! CPUCores does this by micromanaging your Windows OS and non-essential applications to delivery maximum CPU to your game! 1) DIRECT STEAM INTEGRATION CPUCores automatically detects all of your Steam games. 2) OS OPTIMIZATION To start, CPUCores will isolate your entire OS to your first core. Secondly, CPUCores examines and constrains key Windows services that are not essential and known to hog CPU resources. Third, CPUCores examines and isolate key Windows processes to ensure a perfect balance of CPU savings without starving key Windows processes. 3) GAME OPTIMIZATION CPUCores will isolate and dedicate processing cores to be exclusively used by your game. CPUCores will allow game-specific hyper-thread disabling/enabling. 4) BACKGROUND / NON-GAME OPTIMIZATIONS CPUCores examines what non-OS and non-game operations your PC is running. It will do things such as constrain non-game programs to your first processing core. 5) EXTRAS Ability to 'START RANDOM GAME' with 1 button click! Fully supporting VR games! Support for non-Steam games Support for general, non-game applications like video editing, graphic design and more! Convenient game sorting options makes large Steam libraries manageable Incredible community surrounding the software! Direct contact with the developer for suggestions on feature updates! The impact of how CPUCores will help with FPS depends on essentially 2 things: #1 Your PC Hardware #2 The game itself Here are some benchmarks we've recently seen from our test system: ARMA III - 17.5% FPS Increase! Team Fortress 2 - 58% FPS Increase! TombRaider - 6.3% FPS Increase Left4Dead2 - 14% FPS Increase The CPUCores application identifies dozens of Windows programs, background processes, and non-gaming applications, and immediately controls and isolates them to a subsection of your total CPU resources. CPUCores will then free up a block of CPU resources and dedicated it specifically for a game. You can then launch a Steam game, or any game/program, directly via the CPUCores application. This enables CPUCores to control the processor usage for that game/program and ensure it has dedicated usage to processing cores. Your game no longer has to share resources with the OS / other applications. SCREENSHOTS",
