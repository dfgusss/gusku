    "About the game": "Dark Deception: Monsters &amp; Mortals is a multiplayer horror game where players take on the role of monsters and mortals from the Dark Deception universe (and others) and battle each other in nightmarish mazes. Some mazes will look familiar to Dark Deception fans, but many will be completely new! Monsters &amp; Mortals has multiple gameplay modes to play with your friends: 1. Maze Escape: (3 v 1) Three mortals must collect the required number of shards to summon the portal &amp; escape, while a monster seeks to stop or kill them before the time expires. 2. Shard Mayhem: Monsters only mode. 4 players compete against one another in a free for all to collect the most shards in the time limit provided. Shards spawn in waves and can be stolen from other players by attacking or killing them. 3. Soul Collection: 4 Mortals compete for shards in order to save their own soul. At the end of each shard wave, Malak will come for the player with the fewest shards and take their soul. They will become a monster and must hunt down the remaining mortal survivors. In the end, only one mortal will win the right to keep their soul. Here are some of the key features of Monsters &amp; Mortals: - Unique mazes inspired by &amp; taken from the hit game, Dark Deception. - Powerful ultimate abilities unique to each character. - Turn the tables with trap &amp; boss activations.
