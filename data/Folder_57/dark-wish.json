    "About the game": "Dark Wish is an adventure game set in a harsh desert. Explore 'The Dust', a strange and unusual place filled with dangerous animals, bandits, and wanderers who pass on by. A linear but playful and unique story unfolds as you work towards your goal. But will you make it out of the wilderness before you lose all sanity? This game contains some strong language, with themes of violence and visual blood effects. Key Features Exploration with story elements: Follow your main quest to escape the desert, but stop to meet unique and weird friends on the way. Turn based combat system: 'Beyond-turn' based, a twist to blend time between some actions and allows free movement. Character building and inventory system: There are many character builds to try out with RPG mechanics, perks to choose from, and hundreds of items to find. Unique Sound Track: Over two-and-a-half hours of original composed and produced 'synthtronica' music created just for Dark Wish.",
