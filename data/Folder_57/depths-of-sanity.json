As he plunges into the ocean, he has no idea that what he’ll uncover will not only threaten the lives of his crew, but his own sanity. Deep, Involving Storyline: Discover the fate of each crew member of The Baroness and uncover the mystery of the signal coming from the ocean floor. Massive Interconnected World: Explore beautiful coral reefs, sunken wrecks, underground magma lairs and much more in your journey to the darkest depths of the ocean. Search, Scavenge, Stay Alive: Danger comes from every angle. Unlock a wide variety of weapons to help you battle monstrous bosses, survive tense set-pieces, and uncover secrets that expand the story and your chances of survival. Danger from Every Angle: With full 360 degree movement, there are no double jumps or wall runs to help you under the ocean. Use a wide range of unique tools to uncover your environment, including tow lines that help you pull through heavy currents, and a sonar system that helps you navigate through pitch black darkness.",
