They also seem to have a keen eye for shiny things! Dog Clicker is a mix between a clicker game, and a gacha game. Earn tokens by clicking on the dog, or earn gems by completing certain tasks and/or quests! Tokens can be used to buy yourself upgrades or even unique store dogs, upgrades can help provide you a better income for your shiny new token collection. Gems can be used to roll for a gacha dog. Gacha dogs are special dogs that can only be obtained through the random chance of gacha, ranging from common rarity all the way up to legendary rarity. With each rarity provides greater rewards, and possibly even gems. After obtaining dogs, each dog provides you a unique amount of tokens per second or gems per minute. Each dog can only be obtained once.",
