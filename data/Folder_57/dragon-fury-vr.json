    "About the game": "Please be aware this is not a completed game: 1. Currently some part of this game is not affected by time rewind spell, like melee weapons, the HP of units. 2. In this version items in your inventory are sepearated from items outside, so in the current version you cannot store melee weapons in it. Remember where you dropped it. 3. Still some bugs, sometimes enemy can only be attacked by a tower. 4. In the current version there are 4 type of enemies and 3 scenes for survival mode, the forest and desert chapter might feel kind of dry, there will be more enemy and story in future updates, I am working on making the dragon boss work with time magic, he likely will be available in 1.2 5. Enemy attack is not driven by physics yet, likely will change in 1.2 Welcome to “Dragon Fury VR”! This is a first-person VR tower defense game. Your mission: Protect the Dragon Egg and try not to die. Arrow to the knee The destroyed dragon world needs a savior, and your arrival brings new hope to the dragon. Swarming enemies threaten the life of the dragon egg. Keep them away from the egg at all costs! Both the bows and the arrows in 'Dragon Fury VR' are easy to use. Release it from the capsule Shoot a capsule arrow to the ground to build a tower. There will be more tower upgrades added in later versions of the game. Time is in your hands It is said the powerful staff in your inventory was forged by an ancient wizard who enchanted it, imbuing it with his own soul. It has the power to bend space, and even time. Did you make a mistake? Rewind time and use the opportunity to change the future! Or, just freeze the time and give your enemies a good beating. (More magic will be added in future updates) Steel True, blade straight You can choose a melee weapon to confront the enemy. Sharp weapons are easier to use, but not the only option. A blunt weapon can do more damage if you have the strength and stamina. What weapon you use is situation-dependent! (Combat will be more realistic or possibly in a fluid and physics-driven way in future updates.) I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made Different types of enemies think, approach, and attack in different ways. Find the best way to defeat them! (More types of enemies to be added in future updates)",
