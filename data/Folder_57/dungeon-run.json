    "About the game": "I wanted to see how much RPG elements can I add into a running platform game. Lol It looks like quiet a lot. The game has randomized map generation to keep the running exciting. We can collect coins and potions and keys on the map or even break crates and barrels and open chest with keys for even more rewards. Player is equipped with a sword and magic to devastate multiple monsters at once. But watch out fireballs are limited you need to pick up magic potions to replenish your stock! Killed monsters will give you XP witch will be essential later. If you fall behind or touch a trap you lose a life. Collect health potions to keep you running. The speed of running is increasing over time and monsters getting tougher so to keep up you can level up your skills using XP and coins at the shrines and traders. Skills are sword damage, magic damage and running speed. All this while you never stop running! You can play with your friend as local multiplayer is supported up to two players. Keyboard and Gamepads are supported.",
