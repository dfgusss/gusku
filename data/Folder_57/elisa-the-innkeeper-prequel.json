    "About the game": "'If I married all those who said they want me, now I would have so many of those husbands. All men who stay at this inn immediately fall in love with me...' Elisa Our visual novel introduces the story of Elisa, a beautiful owner of an inn, struggling with the amorous proposal of honorable Knights, high born Princes and rich Merchants. It will be the Player to decide Elisa's fate and his/her choices may even influence her destiny for the better or the worse. The Player is -not- the protagonist of this story, however. His/Her judgements affect every character and their actions, like a god that watches everything from above. For this reason, every decision is a tough choice to make. Your choice will change the story forever! Our Prequel summarizes about 20% of our complete story and features 3 main story branches. The choices you make take account for the possibility of gaining special items; It's up to you to dicover them and when to use them. This allows you to influence the outcome of the story in a positive or negative way in specific situations, deciding how the story unfolds. Of course all of those features will play a much more important role once our story will be available in the future. The Prequel is just our first step! Hope you enjoy it!",
