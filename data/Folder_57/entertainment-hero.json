    "About the game": "The first game by Windzen, an independent developer based in Texas. -=-=-=- Battle at the Center of the CPU! Investing in a Direx OS Computer paid off! Entertainment Hero is warned by his new computer of a sinister force approaching his peaceful home of Fami-City. This force is bigger than Hero, stronger, brighter and faster . It's up to Hero to train through four levels before this oncoming force blasts through his walls! Join Entertainment Hero and Direx on a journey to conquer stage after stage as they become the best they can be in the hopes of overcoming this incredible competition! Battle your way through Crash Land, Air Land, and six other themed stages as you near the end of your test. Summon the power of the Hero Blaster as you face the awesome power of Direx's ultimate creation! -=-=-=- Eight Stages of Run and Gun Action Leading to the Final Boss! Choose Different Paths on Different Play Throughs! Search for the Secrets Hidden in the Different Lands! -=-=-=- Windzen is a two-man team, with brothers Nathan and Jeremy Hathcock. We want to give others the same gift that developers from across the world have given us. Everything in Entertainment Hero is drawn by hand and the sound effects made from scratch. It's a little rough around the edges but it was a learning process and a labor of love. We hope you enjoy it! Entertainment Hero is powered by Unity and made possible with Corgi Engine, an awesome creation by More Mountains. More information about More Mountains and Corgi Engine can be found at their website here: / Corgi Engine is a fantastic Unity asset for building games, especially for those like us here at Windzen with little or no programming experience. If you've always wanted to build games but don't know where to start Corgi Engine is the way to go!",
