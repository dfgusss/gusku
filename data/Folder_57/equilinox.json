    "About the game": "Equilinox is a relaxing nature game which allows you to create and nurture your very own diverse ecosystem of plants and animals. Sit back, start growing, and watch your world blossom and evolve in front of you! Create You can start creating your ecosystems by placing plants and animals into your world. Having a variety of plants and trees will make the terrain more fertile and allow wildlife to flourish, while animals will begin to earn you points which can be used to purchase various in-game resources. Nurture Every animal and plant has its own life-cycle, unique behaviors and requirements, so you need to ensure that each species is satisfied with its environment, has enough resources, and that the ecosystems are balanced. Healthy, happy animals will live longer, breed more, and earn you more points. Evolve The points you earn can also be used to genetically modify your species, allowing you to manipulate the traits and behaviors of your species for various benefits. You can also evolve your current wildlife to unlock more exotic plants, trees and creatures. Progress There are multiple in-game tasks that can be completed to gain rewards such as extra diversity points or new content. Some tasks can be repeated, making it possible to farm certain plants and animals to receive a regular income of diversity points. Get Creative! Equilinox also has a fully sandbox mode where you can place as many plants and animals as you like, plus you can genetically modify them to your heart's content! Create swarms of super fast pink wolves, high bouncing rainbow sheep, pixel art made from colored mushrooms, beautiful low-poly scenes, or anything else that you can think of. The possibilities are endless!",
