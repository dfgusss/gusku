    "About the game": "Welcome to hell! Who would have thought that a nuclear weapon is dangerous ... Do you know what to start over? From the very beginning... A few minutes after the start of a nuclear war, the entire planet was covered with a huge wave of resonating atomic energy, which wiped almost all living things from her face. From the land that we knew there were only stones, sand and debris ... All the liquid on the planet has turned into alcohol. The only plants that remained and were able to more or less adapt to the new atmosphere were the mutated cacti, the last safe drinking liquid remained in them. Those few who miraculously survived were lucky enough to call it that, because now they have to hide from deadly sandstorms and crowds of zombies ... Many of them would rather die than for days to dig in the trash in the hope of finding something edible there or something else that will prolong their 'life' «This is a creative discussion on the threat of nuclear weapons. Its production, storage, use and disposal. And also about nuclear terrorism.» 'In this project I tried to convey the most filled emptiness of the post-apocalyptic world, and also to remind that there is always a way out, whatever the circumstances, it is important to remember that once there was only emptiness, but now there is everything. It doesn't matter what you build from, it matters what you build. You can be anyone, you can change this world. John Smoke (Alexander Badrak) ' First Day is a game in mixed genres with a predominant strategy genre, in the game you have to revive a civilization destroyed by a nuclear apocalypse, or, well, or what is generally possible to revive after a nuclear apocalypse.
