There’s a whole wide world waiting just outside those factory doors… you must remain positive! GAMEPLAY Flux8 is a puzzle platformer, based around the polarity of magnets and how they react to opposite and similar forces. You play as two magnets named Newt and Tess. Navigate the factory floor, attracting and repelling at will to avoid your untimely demise. Each level tests your understanding of magnetic forces to navigate and dodge the deadly working environment as you head for freedom. Collect floppy discs throughout your escape to customize Newt and Tess with a range of fashionable accessories. Solve challenging magnet based puzzles! Customize your magnet!
