    "About the game": "Gemlands is a love-letter to that golden era of Playstation 1 and Nintendo 64 3D platformers, in a 1st person metroidvania-lite package! The evil Dimensional Witch has started turning residents of Gemlands into critters and animals; it's up to you to talk to the locals, acquire new tools, and progress your way up the central tower and through the mini-pocket worlds that the Witch has created. Each 'zone' of the game is essentially a small, mini-biome with its own NPCs, and gems and items to collect, which you can keep track of by bringing up a handy menu anytime for those completionists out there. Local legends also tell of the Secret Isles which can only be accessed by the best adventurers, and provides a higher challenge as well as even more gems to collect! Note: As mentioned, this game is shorter and will take only a few hours to 100% complete",
