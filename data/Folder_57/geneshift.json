    "About the game": "SUPPORTER'S EDITION IS INCLUDED NOTE: If you buy Geneshift now you'll get the Supporter's Edition DLC included for free. You don't need to buy them both. This is a special promotion to thank people who support the game during early access. The DLC gives cosmetics, challenges, singleplayer and more. KEY FEATURES IN GENESHIFT Singleplayer Survival Fight against increasingly deadly enemies as you loot and level up your mutant powers. Complete missions, discover skill points, and strategically spend your cash on advanced weapons, perks and vehicles. With a mix of battle royale and roguelite mechanics, looting is essential, death is permanent, and you'll need to master your skills if you want to survive. Battle Royale Turbo (Multiplayer) The circle is shrinking - fast! Play in a series of turbo-fast, back to back rounds where each round lasts only 5 minutes. No waiting around, just pure refined non-stop action. Grab your loot, hop into a car and floor it to the final showdown! Over 30 Tactical Skills Unlock special abilities like Invisibility, Bouncing Bullets, Fire Balls, and Teleportation. Create skill builds with crazy combos and counters, and grow your mutant stronger as you play. Insane Vehicle Action Ride with allies to do drive-by shootings, detonate car bombs, and fire homing missiles. Secret Base Building Place hidden chemicals to gain secret benefits, like selling weapons and spying on enemies. Singleplayer Bot Matches Play against intelligent, life-like bots on various difficulty levels. While playing offline you can still complete challenges, level up, unlock new items, and compete on leaderboards. Daily Leaderboards Compete on daily leaderboards and receive bonus rewards for finishing near the top. Over 100 Challenges Earn bonus XP by completing challenges, like mid-air knife attacks and vehicle jumps. Constant Development I've worked on Geneshift for 10 years now, listen to ideas in Discord every day, and often update based on community feedback! Join the fun at discord.gg/geneshift",
