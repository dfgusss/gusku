    "About the game": "This is a very strange story about a little robot that wakes in a very strange place with a very strange purpose. Everything that surrounds him is really dangerous. He doesn't know why, but something inside is telling him that he should overcome all these traps... But why is he doing this? He doesn't understand what is going on until he gets in a bar. Now he is not a robot anymore... So the basic concept is: The First type of gameplay (platformer) - our hero is locked in the body of a robot and he has to go through all puzzle chambers. Occasionally, he will awaken in his real body. And this is... The second type of gameplay (adventure/visual novel) - here our hero will interact with other characters. Let's call it a storytelling part of the game. - Over 1000 of High-Quality 3DCG images; - Hot girls are waiting! - Intriguing story; - A lot of humor; - Smooth and animations; - 4-5 Hours of gameplay; - More than 50 achievements ; - A lot of minigames and other cool stuff! Controls You can control the character using these keyboard keys: A - Move left; D - Move right; Left Mouse Button - use your pulse (dash); Right Mouse Button - Camera control; ESC - menu . The visual novel/adventure aspect of the game is controlled by the mouse. P.S. If minigames are too hard for you, just skip them using ESC .",
