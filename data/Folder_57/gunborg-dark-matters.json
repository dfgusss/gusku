    "About the game": "Gunborg: Dark Matters is an arcade-style, twin-stick shooter with smooth gameplay and a slick 80s synthwave soundtrack. The game takes place aboard a giant spaceship filled with a variety of traps, hazards, aliens and robots. Do you have what it takes to face constant threats while staying on your feet in the heat of combat? Can you keep your cool when chaos is descending upon you? Move with the keyboard and aim with the mouse, or play Gunborg: Dark Matters as a twin-stick shooter using your gamepad. The unique control scheme allows for platforming and 360° aiming at the same time. Armed with a fierce energy blade, a powerful shield and a jetpack, you will have to traverse the many traps and hazards scattered throughout the ship and destroy any foe that stands in your way. Run, jump, and wall slide your way through a variety of levels, each with their own challenges. Level the playing field by using the weapons of your fallen enemies while deflecting and blocking enemy attacks with your shield. Create a combat chain by killing enemies in quick succession and become infused with dark energy that causes weapons to become more powerful and shoot differently. Collect the many info-bots scattered throughout the ship to unlock additional content, including levels and a hardcore difficulty setting. - Skill-based Gameplay: Use your skills to build a combat chain and accumulate as many points as possible. - Full Gamepad Support: Play with your preferred controls, Gunborg can be played either with a keyboard and mouse or controller of your choice. - Wield a Variety of Weapons: Equip and use the many different and unique weapons of your enemies. - Use a Powerful Shield to Deflect Enemy Attacks: Use your shield to deflect enemy attacks back at them or as a means of surfing an otherwise impassable runway of spikes. - Become Infused with Dark Energy: Maximize your combat chain to become infused with dark energy making weapons more powerful and shoot in new ways. - Super-Fast and Addictive Respawn Cycle: Don’t be slowed down by death. Gunborg's super-fast respawn cycle puts you straight back into the action with fair and well-placed checkpoints. - Collect Info-bots: Unlock bonus levels and the Hardcore difficulty setting by collecting Info-Bots. - Survival Mode: Finish the game to unlock a new mode where you will fight hordes of enemies.",
