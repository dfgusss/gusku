    "About the game": "Hell Loop is a platformer tower defense game, unlike any other tower defense game you know. You are not defending anything valuable. You are torturing sinners who are continually marching, one by one in a long streak, trying to evade their punishment. Select from a random subset of available traps - get each game a different choice! Place traps carefully across the level - you can do it in pause mode or in real-time Watch the bloodshed and upgrade traps Manage your resources of blood - upgrades and placing traps cost blood, kills earns blood Take into account the passive modifiers for the game - they can be both positive and negative! Tower defense meets platformer - a unique combo with a pinch of good old Lemmings vibe (only the Lemmings were cute, our humans are not). Hand-crafted levels with unique challenges. After all who says that hell is only fire and lava. A sinner can very well be tortured in acid or put to work in mines! Select wisely when given the option, as new traps will not come every level. Be aware of game-changing modifiers. Calculate with your blood, every drop of it is important. Killing human grants you a few extra drops. Don't forget to upgrade your traps! No one said being the hell manager is easy.' Steam achievements &amp; leaderboard!",
