    "About the game": "Hogvalord is a combination of action RPG and farming simulation game that takes place in a fantasy medieval world. You play as Lucas, a retired royal servant whose dream is to start a hog farm business in his homeland. But heavy labour isn't the only obstacle that blocks your way to the dreamy future. With many monsters plus an unidentified fishy force that always eager to have both you and your hog's meat in their stomach, what can you do to survive in a harsh world without superpower or magical skill? Give up? Figh back? Run away? The answer is waiting for you in Hogvalord. KEY FEATURES Story-oriented gameplay : farming is not just for a living, farming is a part of the story. Figure out what has been threatening the peace of your homeland as the story progresses. Beware of choices, it can lead to a dreadful ending. Gathering : wander dangerous forests, collect resouces to build your farm. Design your own farm : build your farm however you like, be it a maze, a home or simply a dump. Just a small reminder, your farm is also your warzone 😄 Raise your hogs manually : provide them food, water or... weird potion. If they're happy, they can give birth to little piggy once in a lifetime. Hog evolution : 'piggy is what piggy eats', the food affect the hog's shape. Raise different type of hogs and evolve them into different mythical creatures. Yes, mythical creatures, maybe they aren't that useless after all. Combat : fight and defend the farm like a real medieval peasant. No magic, no superpower, time to work out some muscles and brain cells 😉 Growing crops : grow you own organic veggies to feed the hogs. No need to wait for the morning market anymore. Visual : top-down cute 3D graphics plus 2D beautiful hand painted character portraits &amp; illustrations.",
