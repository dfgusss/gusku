'Every time I look at the ocean, I realize that one day my soul will return there.' GAME FEATURES Interact with customers and mix cocktails in mini-games. Or send them away so you could once again wipe down wineglasses and gaze upon the sea beyond the window... And, of course, try to learn the secret of the curse. Go on dates and learn more about the world around you. After all, the sea is just outside your window, and is there any place more romantic than a seaside tavern? You can expect: Four endings. Morin's journey can turn out to be quite different, and it's all up to you! Explore the world of Into the Waves for 35 minutes or 2 hours. Animated sprites Original soundtrack that creates a magical atmosphere Small details that add to the bigger picture",
