    "About the game": "Invaders From Dimension X! is a solitaire game depicting battles between the crack 124th Galactic Marine Raider Battalion (nicknamed “The Old Reprobates”) of the Unified Space Alliance Defense Force and the invading “pods” of a mysterious alien race, commonly known as the Kay’otz. The Kay'otz come from another dimension of space and do not behave in a way humans can comprehend. Only with perseverance and skillful strategy - and yes, some good fortune - will you be able to eventually discover the plans and tactics of these mysterious beings. Adapted from the Board Game designed by Hermann Luttmann and published by Tiny Battle Publishing . Tiny Battle Publishing is the brainchild of Mark H. Walker focusing on small footprint games (usually 88 counters, 1-2 game maps, 8-16 pages of rules). Working with talented designers, new and established, such as Hermann Luttmann, Brian Train, Gottardo Zancani, and Mark himself, Tiny Battle releases affordable games on a wide variety of subjects: historical, sci-fi, you name it. A one player tactical strategy game Two Battle scenarios and one Campaign scenario Play as the Marines against the Kay'otz Marine units have different weapons and roles Two Maps No two games the same",
