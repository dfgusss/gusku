    "About the game": "Jelly blocks is a squishy match-3 game you create matches by bouncing and smooshing blocks together. The bouncy soft pieces pile up, creating a unique play field that you stack your pieces on. Think of it as squishy Tetris. The game has a chill paced zen-mode that goes infinitely long as long as you don't fill the board too full. The other mode, challenge mode, starts going faster as you match pieces and has a timer you have to constantly increase by matching pieces.",
