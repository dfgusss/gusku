Do you want to explore the world on foot or drive one of the available vehicles? Do you prefer to search for junk or look for hidden treasures? Is renovation your thing? Or maybe you're more of a heavy machinery kind of guy? Would you rather sell enormous amounts of small items or try something more ambitious, like repairing a vintage car? Whatever you choose, and as long as it is junk-related, we got you covered. As an owner, you must remember the following: - Process metal using machines. This will help you get rich quickly. - Help yourself with vehicles.
