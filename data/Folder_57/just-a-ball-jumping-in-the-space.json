Follow our friend, get to know her story and how she got there! Lose your sanity jumping through dozens and dozens of cosmos (Be careful not to fall!) and most importantly: Enjoy the journey, because life is short. In this game the challenge is to climb the highest possible by the space to beat it, remember to be careful so you dont fall and lose your progress. Here you will find 40 different levels with new mechanics along the game. It is worth mentioning the story points, pay attention in the details about the game so you can understand a little bit more about our main character.",
