    "About the game": "Kenomaze is a 2D RPG Maze game where you play through several different mazes based on my crazy mind, you can solve them alone. Definitely not based on any RPG Maker game called Omori, as that would get me in legal trouble, so we're certainly not doing that. You have to solve different mazes with your friends in a normal world but the longer you stay with your friends...you will find out the truth why the world looks weird sometimes and you will also find out what you did long time ago... In the Story Mode (Singleplayer) You have to complete a lot of Mazes in the Kenomaze Tower with your friends. In the Tower there are different mazes and also monsters you have to fight with your friends on your side. In every maze there are also hidden easter eggs that you can find to unlock Achievements so explore everything and dont rush through mazes without checking everything out! Features: Mazes Story RPG Milk",
