Local and online cross-platform multiplayer Gather friends and/or challenge complete strangers no matter what platforms they choose to play on. 8 player madness Whether you have friends around or not, you can always fill the match with customizable and challenging AI opponents. Extremely easy to learn Choose a classic controller or go for our intuitive keyboard and mouse controls. Ridiculous amount of game modes Brawl in a battle royale, capture the Grail, push the payload, hunt for souls, become the Minion Master and much much more. Wacky weaponry Arm your knight with weapons from the middle age such as the noble bow, the exotic boomerang or the sneaky proximity mines.
