    "About the game": "Krakatoa is a single player Action-Adventure/Survival Horror game. Attempt to find your son and escape Siren Head. Listen closely to get an advantage in surviving an onslaught of attacks. Photo-realistic environments integrated with 3D audio bring the experience to life. Succeed in escaping and you'll live to see another day, but you can't run forever. I look forward to any feedback as this is my first game and I'm still learning the process. It will be very helpful toward improving Krakatoa and any games I make in the future. Thank you for checking it out!",
