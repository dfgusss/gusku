    "About the game": "Welcome to Lone Archer. Lone Archer is a casual action VR Game. Defeat endless waves of incoming enemies, all of whom wish for nothing more than your utter destruction. Gather Power-ups to boost your score and heal your wounds. So far, there are 4 unique environments, each with a different enemy challenge. 22 Different enemies. The Village Will see you battling the Orc horde. The Cave Is filled with the most vile ghouls, each ready to rip you apart with their bare claws. The Temple Erupts with the skeletal remains of its former inhabitants. The Crossroads Is the place where all 3 of these worlds collide. See how far you can get! As a solo indie game developer, this game represents roughly the last 6 months of evenings and weekends, but it isn't intended to end there. I hope all who try out this game look at it as a work in progress and provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement. I look forward to adding more content based on your feedback.",
