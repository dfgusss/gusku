    "About the game": "Mini Hockey VR is a virtual reality game that sets you in a small basement with one AI Goalie. You have a goalie glove in your left hand, a stick and blocker in your right hand, and pads that are set on the ground where you should be. Try to score on the computer goalie, but beware, he will charge and shoot the puck back at any time! Always be ready to face a shot and keep it out of your net. Free updates to this game will happen to allow the game to grow. Any suggestions to the game will be accepted and read by me, the developer. Have fun and score some goals!",
