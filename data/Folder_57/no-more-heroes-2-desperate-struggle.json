    "About the game": "Travis Touchdown here. It's been three years since I clawed my way to #1 in the United Assassins Association. I thought it'd be fine to take it easy for a while after that, but it looks like I rested on my laurels a little too long. I found myself sliding down the ranks all the way to #51, and to make things worse, some other assassin—Skelter Helter—comes out and starts nagging my head off about me killing his brother or something. So yeah, a real pain in the you-know-what. Fueled by a thirst for vengeance (and a bit of good old-fashioned greed), I whipped out my beam katana once more and plunged headfirst into one helluva desperate struggle. Experience the frenetic hack-and-slash gameplay of the sequel to No More Heroes in glorious HD! With more characters to play as and even more foes to stand in your way, there's never a dull moment in the world of No More Heroes 2: Desperate Struggle . Featuring three playable characters, the ability to dual-wield beam katanas, and even bigger baddies to battle, this sexy sequel is a wild ride with more to love than ever before. Kick back, grab a slice, and get ready to dive into a mind-melting drama the likes of which you've never seen! Features Dual-wield beam katanas as Travis Touchdown to dial the hack-and-slash insanity up to 11! More baddies than ever before to go toe-to-toe with! Jump through combat as the agile Shinobu or leave foes in the dust as Travis' brother, Henry. Experience a blast from the past by playing 8-bit minigames to earn money and power up!",
