    "About the game": "“ All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. ” In Orwell's Animal Farm, the animals have fought off their exploitative human masters. Now they're in charge. In this text-based choice-driven narrative game you can assign their tasks, manage their resources, choose their laws, and direct their propaganda. Determine which of the animals will make sacrifices and which will be 'more equal than others.' George Orwell's 1945 novella was a scathing critique of totalitarianism in the early days of the Soviet Union. Since then, it has spoken to people of many ideologies in countries around the world. It offers a powerful awareness of how power can be abused – and of how generation after generation seeks a more just and equal society, where the many do not suffer at the hands of the few. Orwell's Animal Farm brings the familiar characters and situations to the medium of a game, and to the context of 2020. Depending on how you play, you may encounter situations very close to those in the book, or others influenced by events Orwell never lived to see. Play it to explore a classic tale from inside. Play it to try your hand at running the farm – or because you dream of spreading Animalism across the world. Play it because you've always wanted to oversee a construction project by a herd of cows. Play it because Boxer deserved better.",
