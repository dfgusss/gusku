    "About the game": "Play PostZ in VR and get immersed in zombie survival arcade fun! Designed exclusively for VR, PostZ takes you straight to the action, with fun gunplay and increasingly challenging zombies. The game is easy to get into yet hard to master. Story mode includes five beautiful and immersive locations, with difficulty levels from Casual mode to a very challenging headshots only Expert mode. With laser and red dot sights, shooting is responsive and accurate. There is no aim assist, which adds a rewarding sense of accomplishment as the player improves their shooting skills. For dark locations, just touch the visor to turn night vision on and off. Improve your best score with each play session and advance your place on the Global Leaderboards. How far can you go? Features Get straight to the action with quick access, easy to pick up and hard to master gameplay. Dangerous zombies - if a zombie gets to you, then you're out. Headshots - A headshot will always stop a zombie. Shots to the body will also eventually stop them, just not in Expert Mode. Headshot Streaks - Consecutive headshots give an increasingly large bonus point reward. A headshot streak resets on a missed shot or a hit to the body resetting the bonus point reward. To achieve the highest possible scores, keep headshot streaks going for as long as possible. 360 degree gameplay- zombies are moving in from every angle so scan your surroundings to find your next target before it finds you! Story Mode - play through five locations with one chance to complete the waves in each location. Develop your skills to win achievements and get to the top of the leaderboards. Controls Point the weapon downrange and shoot. Reload by pointing the gun down. Night vision can be toggled on and off by bringing your controller up to the side of the headset. Sometimes you have to fight to survive, even if your gun acts like the dinner bell for other zombies nearby. When battling the dead, situational awareness is key, so watch your back! Have fun, stay safe and watch out for zombies!",
