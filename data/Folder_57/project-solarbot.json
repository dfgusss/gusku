    "About the game": "In short: Project SolarBot is a Metroidvania! You'll visit the freely explorable planet E.R.S. as a SolarBot. Recover long forgotten technologies and upgrades to unlock new abilities and save your home! But keep your solar meter constantly in mind. Avoid dark places and stay in the light to avoid surprising shutdowns. As the last salvation of a civilization you'll be sent on the mission to gather as much information and data as possible in order to prevent the decline of your homeland. Maybe you'll find a new home for your creators? E.R.S. is a planet full of different landscapes and complex cave systems. Often times you'll reach dead ends, whose overcoming will cost more than mere force of arms. Always think of your energy supply while researching though. If the 'SU' drops to 0, it means Game Over! Look for light sources and solar tanks to keep your systems up and running. --- Watch out, Speedrunners! --- With the built-in timer function you'll have your current time always displayed on screen. But watch out: in this game, sprinting costs valuable energy. So what do you prefer? Weak and fast or slow and strong? Will you find the route that'll lead you to that one run? --- The influence and inspiration--- This one is obvious: It's Super Metroid through and through. And I tried to reflect that in every pixel and every note played, without transforming into an uninspired copy.",
