    "About the game": "Take control of Experimental Tactics Unit #02 and help them defeat the rogue Unit #01 in this fast-paced game of tug-of-war. Mine for resources and use them to rapidly build up your army. Deploy various support structures along your way to aid you in your fight. Collect parts from wrecked units and use them against your opponents. Quickly change unit composition to adapt to the enemy's tactics and overwhelm them. The game puts an emphasis on terrain verticality and gives you direct 3rd person control of your units, allowing you to easily navigate caves and tunnels, scale walls and ceilings, and blast enemy units off of cliffs and into bottomless pits. Be mindful though, the AI can use all the same tricks. Playing using a controller is recommended. Other features Instant unit construction; no build times Casualized micro - easily switch selected unit types Tanks, AA and bombers follow a rock-paper-scissors model Multi-core optimized pathfinding Supports arbitrary framerates and resolutions Discord Feel free to visit the Discord to discuss features, balancing and (Deck) compatibility.",
