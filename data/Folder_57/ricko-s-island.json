    "About the game": "Ricko's Island is a collectathon platformer with controls that are actually fun. Travel between 10 islands, master the movement controls, complete platforming challenges, and possess enemies. If you are a fan of mastering movement controls in platformers, this is the game for you! Introduction Ricko now has to leave his Island in the goal of finding out the cause of the chaos and fix it. He's got a special core helping him, one of it's kind - it allows him to perform new moves and possess other enemies to use their unique abilities. Possess enemies such as Vinemaster to use his grapple vines, Rockbolt to roll around and jump to high places, and many more! Travel between Islands with plenty of places to explore and platforming challenges to master. Movement The most important thing about a platformer is the movement, so we made sure Ricko's movement is fun, satisfying, and progresses throughout the game. Only 3 keys used (and WASD) to perform over 10 moves and each enemy has it's own new moves! The game was made for casual and hardcore gamers in mind. You can also buy new abilities and upgrades in the shop, such as Sprint, Air Jump, and more! Islands To be able to travel between Islands you will need to collect cores that are everywhere, though some are harder to find or reach than others. From grass to acid, every Island is unique! There are 10 Islands for you to explore and found secrets in, good luck finding all of those cores! About Tbjbu2 The Developer This is my first game inspired by Super Mario Odyssey! Although I was just starting out and many things could've been done better, I still believe it is very fun and I have fully played and enjoyed it myself multiple times!",
