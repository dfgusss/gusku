    "About the game": "SkyTime - Save your family after a horrible accident. SkyTime was publicly chosen to be the number 1 game and has found love from all the people that have played it. SkyTime is a 3D platformer in which you slow time, dodge bullets, destroy turrets and overcome obstacles! If you ever played SUPERHOT or Clustertruck, this game combines them both! In SkyTime you are a scientist who lost their family in an avalanche, and are trying to get them back. You create a time machine, but are missing one key component - the reactor core to power it. You steal one from the evil private military company Mortech, and are now being chased. Can you outrun them?",
