    "About the game": "In Skyward your objective is to survive as long as you can while collecting coins to achieve a High Score. Avoid taking damage from the Missiles and Mines as you have limited Health that can only be recovered with Health Drops. Challenge your skills in this unique arcade style strategy game. Make your airship rise by pressing the space bar, then wait for gravity to pull you back down. Develop your timing and accuracy, with increasing difficulty from random object generation the longer you play. See how long you can stay in the sky! A first project by Indie Australian game developer, Paracosmic Illusions.
