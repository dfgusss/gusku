    "About the game": "The milky way galaxy has become a warzone. A space empire called 'The Sheyertonian Empire' has been stealing resources from The Valeratonac Empire. The Sheyertonians will take as much resources from the Valeratonac at any cost. Even if that cost is the lives of many. You are part of the Valeratonac. Your mission is to find and take down their most powerful ships so their main bases can be taken down. Space Survival is a 3D PC shoote'm up game with large maps and various levels to complete. The short single-player campaign is continuous with cut-scenes explaining the story as you play. You can save your progress. Your saved games begin at the beginning of each level. There is a page clearly explaining the controls and there is the option to change game graphics qualities to match your computer's graphical capabilities. Read the manual included on the Steam game page for game-play instructions. Game Manual: 1- Follow the instructions in the game to complete the game. 2- Use Up Arrow Key/W to move forward and Down Arrow Key/S to reverse/move back. 3- Use your mouse to look around. 4- Shoot the enemies with your weapon using Middle Mouse Button to aim and Left Mouse Button to shoot. 5- Travel at galactic speed using Num 1 (on your numberpad) or Q (on your keyboard) to get to where you want quicker than regular speed . 6- Your ship has a cloak which you can use to sneak past enemies. Activate your cloak using the i key. If you attack an enemy ship while cloaked they will eventually track down where your fire is coming from and they will attack you. 7- Life support is how many hours oxygen will be generated on your ship. If you run out of life support you will die. Galactic speed charge is how charged your galactic drive is to travel at galactic speed. 8- Docking stations can be used to resupply on life support or recharge your galactic drive for travelling at galactic speed. Hold the E key or Right Control key and fly to the docking station to enter it. 9- Use the R key to repair your ship if damaged. 10- Use F6 to save your progress and F7 to load your last save. You can also pause and use the menu to save your progress and load your last save. 11- If you start a new game it will override any other saved games. 12- Saved games start at the beginning of the level.
