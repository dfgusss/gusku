    "About the game": "SQUIDS FROM SPACE is an 8v8, team-based tactical PvP top-down shooter where the Earth is under attack from a race of sinister aliens -- The Squids! Taking place in a retro 1950's setting, the people of Earth must unite and fight back, pitting human weapons of war against the Squids' bizarre technology in a battle for the future of the planet! Join Our Community! We have a Discord Community that anyone is welcome to join! Get instant interaction with the creators of SQUIDS FROM SPACE. Ask questions, voice concerns, share your ideas, and share your creative content (videos, streams, art, etc) with others. FEATURES Play as a human and defend Earth, or play as a Squid and conquer it! Default Team sizes are 8v8! Engage in chaotic fire-fights in a light-hearted and colorful universe. Different game modes with multiple maps! Battles last 10~15 minutes, making it easy to play as much or as little as you want. As a human, blast your foes with shotguns, rocket launchers, grenades or bundles of dynamite! As a Squid, disintegrate your enemies with deadly rays, or pilot a massive Crawler Tank! Out-strategize your opponents by collecting resources and unlocking better weapons for your team. Blow up cars, gas stations, oil barrels, and plenty of other things as you wage war across the map. AI bots with different personalities automatically fill empty team slots. Plenty of support-style weapons to choose from, for those who are teamwork-inclined!",
