The background story of 'Stalker' is that a teenager encounters various events on the road following a young girl. The teenager (player) can selectively interact and give repairs / help due to these events. How the teenager (player) choose will lead to different ending. You may meet a patient with heart disease, but in order not to lose the girl, you ignore his heart attack and doesn't provide help; you may also encounter a falling cat. Even if the cat will not die, you still hugged her in time because of her cuteness; you may pass by a residential area on a stormy day. Trash cans are all overturned, and you choose to fix them for a better world. The game can be played many times to achieve different achievements and unlock various CGs.",
