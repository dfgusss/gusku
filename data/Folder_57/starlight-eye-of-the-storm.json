The Full Release shall comprise of the following modes you can play: Campaign Mode - A storytelling modular mission-based play style where you can choose which missions to fly first. Each main mission consists of 3 short segments that must be completed in order to complete the mission as a whole. There'll be 7 main missions and 8 side missions. Side missions offer a slightly different flavour and can yield different types of bounty. Weapon shop can be accessed anytime as well. Arcade Mode - A no-frills 10-stage play style where the Weapon Shop is accessed once upon a stage's completion. An abridged version of the whole story without the storytelling elements; all action!

Experiment different builds, different upgrades and see how much it can change the dynamics of the game. Steam Remote Play recommended! DRIFT MODE Drift (auto-pivot mode) around your enemies with style as they may challenge you to a dogfight duel! Can be upgraded later to intelligently focus on the most important or current target while ignoring non-essential targets. WEAPONS Each playable ship has a different set of emplacements (up to 3) that can be installed with different types of weapons. WEAPON SHOP!

The Council of Foresight has since chosen you and 2 of your top ace pilot friends for the mission to re-establish contact with the Council on Mars. Your ships will therefore deliver the top secret communication data via the massive wormhole and to the orbit of Mars where the local government forces will be waiting. You'll be supported tacitly by allies of the UNC through sales of secret weapons to your team. Since your mission is under absolute secrecy, you'll be attacked by ALL forces. As enemy ships (pirates) began pouring forth and your immediate mission is to protect the UNC Headquarters Space Station that is still currently under construction from attack. Henceforth, the Starlight: Eye of The Storm saga begins....",
