    "About the game": "It's still early in Meowshore, but cats are already crowding the roofs of buildings. They'll be fine as long as they don't see other cats of the same breed. Use little kittens as notes, to mark the possibilities of each space (kittens are 100% cute and don't fight with each other). Play 24 puzzles (each representing a time of day) and try to reach the sunrise again. Like traditional sudoku, each puzzle has only one solution. Whether you are an experienced Sudoku player, or someone who has never played Sudoku before, we got you covered! Sudokats Supports Tilt Five Level up your game night with tabletop holograms! The Tilt Five™ holographic gaming system transforms tabletop and video games into 3D vibrant holographic environments. Using the Tilt Five™ augmented reality (AR) glasses, Gameboard, and Wand controller, you can immerse yourself in experiences like never before. Visit Tilt Five's website to find out how to bring Sudokats alive on your tabletop! Playing Sudokats with Tilt Five glasses creates a new level of immersion in Meowshore. Notice the city sounds dynamically changing as you move around the board. View the puzzle from different angles, trying to see the cats' patterns in a much more intuitive way than using the traditional commands to rotate the scenery.",
