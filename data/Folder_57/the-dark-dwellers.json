    "About the game": "THE DARK DWELLERS is a side-scrolling action game taking place in an ancient and forgotten underground city. You will play as The Mortali, a nameless man cast into this dark pit as an abducted child, forced to grow up around death and misery. Explore the darkness, grow stronger, fight hordes of nightmarish enemies, face off against powerful bosses and unravel the supernatural mysteries of The Maddening Curse. Along your adventure you will meet many new friends and enemies, whose personalities spring to life with the addition of a large cast of professional voice-actors. As a child born into the tribe of the Mortali, you may use your natural affinity for Blood Magic to devastate your foes. Weave these magical abilities together with multiple different melee weapons to become an unstoppable force. Purchase new abilities and earn the weapons of your fallen enemies to increase your arsenal. In this decrepit underground city, death is not permanent. The trapped prisoners whom call this place home live a life of endless torture and pain, and are maddened by constantly killing and being killed. Cast into the pit as sinners and criminals, will The Dark Dwellers find a permanent end to this torment? Or will they simply succumb to The Maddening Curse, and wander the darkness for eternity?",
