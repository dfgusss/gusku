    "About the game": "Surrounded by a strange forest, you come across a large, peculiar metal cylinder in the middle of a murky marsh. It has slimy, rusty ladder rungs along one side. You don't know why it looks slightly familiar, but somehow you are sure that you need to find a way to get across the marsh and investigate what's down below. As you discover old crusty machines, tunnel entrances, a radio shack, and a handful of strangers, you begin to piece together the history of the experiment that had long gone amok. The Epsilon Outcome is a point-and-click adventure game with amnesia, disappearances, strange men in gray hazmat suits, and 8-bit graphics. This project is the developer's culmination of years of art, music, writing and programming, and is new for 2021 (apart from minor preleases). This game's for you if: you're in to retro games, science fiction, or mysteries indie/grassroots stories, art and music are your interest you like to solve puzzles on your own or with a friend. Works with Steam Remote Play Together! Features: Interact with characters and solve puzzles LucasArts-style dialog, simplified Sierra-style interface A world of 39 screens Original 14-song soundtrack Online hint guide if you're in a pickle While the game features audio design, the game can be completed without sound.",
