Add manual mode, can be played as a SLG game. ======================== == The Author's Statement == ======================== This game was created by me in April 2020, after I returned to Wuhan.China to work alone, I was bored at home after get off work and decided to code it. The game code was developed by me during the first month of get off work and weekends. Because it's my first time to use the Unity, and I usually use C++ language, It cost lots of time to learn C# and Unity without pointers. At the most difficult time, it takes nearly a weekend to solve one problem. Such as camera, coordinate system, generation Unity object by code and so on. After 1 month I completed the code, and then I started draw ui, It took a week and I still not finish to drawing a pixel character that I was satisfied with, So I asked someone to help with the drawing, Then June to July passed, My’s company started to work overtime on 995 and single and double breaks, More workload than usual came to me, So I focus on work, the development of the game basically stopped, and at the same time synchronization of other art resources. Until August, after the company’s heavy work eased, the art resources were still not finished, I asked the guy and he said wait for a few days always. So I decide to do it by myself. By looking for Unity’s resources, I can barely find the most suitable resources to use ourselves and adjust and then code development. In addition, i get my child back home in Wuhan, and my personal available time was shorter. Until now, in October, all the art and music resources were finally developed. In line with the beginning and the end, although I am not satisfied with the art of this game, But still release the game, it was giving an explanation to myself. ============= == In the end == ============= This is not a beautiful game, but I hope this game can make you to think it is an interesting game. This studio is my temporary name. All the members of the studio are actually only me alone. I like development, and I like to develop games. I know that the art resources of this game is really bad. I will change it if i can get or made the handsome resources. Many ideas have not yet been realized. This version is currently the first version, I will continue to update new content. The locale file can be modified for other languages by customize. You can email me if you hane any questions.",
