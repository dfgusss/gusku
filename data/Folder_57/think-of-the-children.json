    "About the game": "Little Bobby’s dead, the BBQ is on fire, Jen’s eating poisonous berries and the birthday cake still needs icing. It’s just another wonderful day out with the kids in Think of the Children, a frantic parenting simulator for up to four players. Hauled before the court for bad parenting and endangering the lives of your children, the Prosecutors present a series of events as evidence that will either condemn or exonerate you: a birthday party at the park, a day at the zoo, a camping trip, an unexpected visit to the Australian Outback and more. Each of these locations proves to be far more dangerous than they sound, and even the tamest of environments are filled with deadly hazards. Run solo, or team up with other parents to play through each trip in flashback to prove your parenting skills-and your innocence-to the judge, and avoid going to jail. Multi-tasking mayhem There’s never a dull moment when you’ve got the BBQ to tend, picnic tables to set, some of the kids are playing with a rabid dog, and two of them just ran out onto the road. Parenting is hard To get a good parenting grade and avoid jail time you’ll need to get all your tasks done, keep the kids happy, and–ideally–alive! Nowhere is safe The local park, the beach, the supermarket, the zoo. Great places for a day out with the kids. That is, aside from the poisonous berries, ravenous seagulls, towering grocery shelves and electrified pens. All kinds of families welcome Single parent? Two mums? A mum, two dads and a horse in a long distance relationship? It’s all good. Parent solo or co-operatively with up to four players.",
