    "About the game": "Experience TRANSIENT like never before in the Extended Edition. Go beyond what you know with additional gameplay, a brand-new ending and an assortment of quality of life improvements. From the creators of CONARIUM and the DARKNESS WITHIN series, comes TRANSIENT , a Lovecraftian Cyberpunk thriller. In the distant, post-apocalyptic future, what is left of mankind lives in an enclosed citadel created to survive the harsh outside environment. Delve deep into this dystopian world and investigate what is happening to you and your friends. Solve puzzles, hack systems and plug in to explore other dimensions. Discover a truth that might tear apart your sanity and question your very existence. “The Only Thing That Is Constant Is Change” ― Heraclitus Experience a never-before seen blend between H.P. Lovecraft’s cosmic existentialism and a grim, dystopian cyberpunk setting. Transient adapts and expands upon seminal pieces of both genres to ensure that your experience is both familiar and fresh at the same time. From the forgotten wastes of Kor Shehr to the mean streets of Providence, Transient is filled to the brim with unforgettable locations to traverse. Explore reality, your own dreams, and the virtual world to meet a diverse cast of friends, foes, and beings in between. Combining a swath of beautiful environments with a haunting original soundtrack creates an immersive experience. You assume the role of Randolph Carter, a man equipped (read: augmented) for the job. Use your advanced perception heightening implant, PHI, to investigate your surroundings, scan for clues, and hack your way past barriers preventing you from uncovering the truth. /",
