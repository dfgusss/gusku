All the videos are streamed in 4K resolution. “If we were meant to stay in one place, we would have roots rather than feet!” My friend Damia recently went on a trip around the world. She started in Australia and went around China, Nepal, India, South Korea, Indonesia and few other countries. She learned about people's struggles, experienced life with the locals and learned about their culture. Seeing her Facebook posts inspired me. I was pumped to do the same! The only problem was that all I had was 100 bucks in my bank account and a Vive. That’s why I decided to build an app which would let me travel in VR. Presenting Travel VR, the best way to travel. Bon voyage! Gameplay - Try moving your head around to highlight different countries. - To spin the earth, hold down the trigger on your right hand and move it. - To make the earth bigger, press down the grip button on both controllers and spread your hands apart. - Look at the country you want to travel to. When the country is highlighted, press the left touchpad to travel. Videos There are over 500 videos from all over the world to watch. All in 360°. China This app won't work in Mainland China. Sorry about that. This has something to do with the Great Firewall.",
