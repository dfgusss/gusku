The players have completely different game experiences. Player 1 controls his character using a keyboard or a gamepad and sees the game in a third-person view. Player 2 controls his character with a mouse and sees the game from a top-down perspective. Find out how well you and your friend understand each other: all the challenges you will face in the game can only be solved by acting together . Join forces, look at everything from different angles and use the characters' unique skills to solve puzzles and fight back against dangerous robots. The main emergency control center has received a report that a serious man-made disaster may be occurring at a nuclear power plant. Playing as agent Annie and her robot Jackie, go on a mission to find out what happened and prevent a terrible accident. Play with your friend, even if they are far away, with Remote Play Together !",
