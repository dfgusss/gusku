The game offers a large, open hunting ground where you will find animals such as the majestic red deer, the elusive European hare, wild boar and fallow deer roaming freely in the wilderness. So pack your gear, master the realistic weapon handling and ballistics at the range and then head out into the open wilderness! Your hunt Select your weapons, pack your other essential equipment, set the time and then step out into the wilderness. Track animals, use hunting towers or follow your intuition and see what you find. How you decide to hunt is totally up to you! Each hunt is always a new adventure and seeing as you get a fresh spawn of animals each time, a new challenge! Steady your aim With our weapon stabilization system, you can make very accurate shots, even at longer distances. Taking a clean shot is important, the animal will go down faster and save you a long tracking job! Unique wildlife Each animal has their own unique behavior, making them challenging and interesting to hunt. With their senses they can see, smell and hear you so approach with caution. Big trophy animals have keener senses, making them much harder but also more rewarding to hunt. Using the right weapon or ammo will give you full integrity and better rewards. Taxidermy and trophy mounts Virtual Hunter includes a one of a kind trophy mount system, where players can freely place their taxidermied trophies around the lodge! You can choose different wall mounts, full body mounts and table mounts for small game. Each animal has several different poses to choose from. Want to place your highest scoring red deer over the fireplace or by the door? The choice is yours! Show your trophies You can unlock different trophy statues by taking down big animals with the correct weapon or ammo type. There are four different trophy ranks for every animal and each animal has different fur types. These trophies will even keep track of your personal best!",
