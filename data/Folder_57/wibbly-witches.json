    "About the game": "Wibbly Witches is a fast and frantic couch competition for 2-4 players. Use spells creatively to outsmart your friends as you fight across unique arenas that become more dangerous as the match progresses. Battle alongside an assortment of creatures and hazards that will appear as the competition gets heated. Hide from giant crabs and spiders, dodge spinning buzz saws and struggle against the elements atop swaying towers. Wield powerful and unusual spells against your friends! Ranging from dramatic explosives and screaming comets to a shotgun blasts of dust. While some spells seem useless at first, their full potential can be unlocked by a truly creative caster. Battles are won more through careful mind games than force. A wyrd and wobbly world awaits you!",
