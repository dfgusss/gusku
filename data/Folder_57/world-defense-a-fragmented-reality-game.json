    "About the game": "Tower defense has never been closer to home. Defend your own house from the powers that would take it from you. Or, choose to defend some of the more iconic locations throughout the globe; it's your choice. Care to defend the Seattle Space Needle? Or perhaps Washington, DC itself? Or the liquor store just around the corner? The choice is yours. But be ready - 'cause they certainly are. World Defense is the first, physics based, 3d tower defense where anything and everything depends upon real world simulations. Additionally, World Defense incorporates Fragmented Reality (tm) where you can move objects from the real world into your game and make them part of the action! (Note: This companion mobile app ships after the main release). {steam_app_image}/extras/ingame.png",
