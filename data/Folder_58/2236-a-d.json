    "About the game": "Which is longer, past or future? —April 1st, 2236 A.D. —99 e-mails were unread. —99 e-mails from the same sender… her. This tale began five years earlier, in the spring of 2231. Mankind has evolved a new kind of communication ability called “telepathy”. Yotsuba notices a young girl who does not use telepathy in his first term. In the days that follow, she remains closed off. One day in the yard at his home, Yotsuba finds a Phillips-head screwdriver. He traces its origin to a nearby abandoned manor, and enters. Inside, he finds something… The thing that humanity has denied. The thing that memory has forgotten. Which is longer, past or future? This is a novel game to look over 'myself'",
