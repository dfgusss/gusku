    "About the game": "A 2D action/explorer surrounding the events of the French-Indian War in North America. Use your knowledge to pass enemy encounters and discover the events that led to a global conflict that spanned from 1756-1763. You will guide a French Infantryman through historical events that shaped our nation. Establish trade with the local Natives for weapons, cut your way through Ohio territory, and battle the Brittish army as they try to expand their territory under rule of King George III. Players can move around a map and interact with NPCs and objects that give information then, use that information to progress in the game by shooting correct answers to enemy encounters. Make your way through enemy occupied territory and battle a young lieutenant, George Washington. Hunt beavers for pelt and trade fur with Native Americans for useful tools that cut open new pathways.",
