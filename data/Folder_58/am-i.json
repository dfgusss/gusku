    "About the game": "When we talk about outer space is there something cooler than an astronaut? Someone could have said a space marine, but where are we, in the first decade of the 2000s? What about a Russian dog astronaut cursing in the afterlife? Laika is the protagonist of this small absurd point and click game, hand-drawn and animated. After being sent into space Laika will find herself exploring some asteroids, meeting weird and obnoxious characters and solving puzzles in order to figure out what the hell is happening to her. Through her journey she will lose herself in time, space and even in herself, if that makes some sense for you. The big question is: is she dead? Probably yes, but that’s not a big spoiler, actually that’s just the premise of the game and the starting point for a bigger question. This entirely hand-drawn point-and-click adventure will test you with puzzles based on the concept of time, space and your own individuality. 3 Different planets to explore A lot of puzzles to be solved Beautiful Hand-drawn graphics and animations Curious characters with ambiguous morals and revolting personalities Atmospheric soundtrack",
