    "About the game": "Animaddicts 3 is a punishing jumping game. With practice, you'll be able to jump, but explore with care; a single missed jump could lead to a long fall back down. In this game you will jump from platform to platform to get as high as possible, in a constant challenge not to fall and start all over again from the beginning. The gameplay is clear and simple. You control a character where you can walk left or right and you need to jump over the platforms to try to climb as much as you can. Do you accept the challenge? Between 20 minutes with speedrun or hours of agonizing gameplay, depending. The median time to finish for my playtesters was 4 hours. Controller Support This game has Full Controller Support.",
