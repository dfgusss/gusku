    "About the game": "Please enjoy the demo version and let us know if you find anything that could be improved for your specific gear. In this demo app only the first three sessions are available to play. None the less, the three demo sessions available are definitely worth downloading because there is much to learn from those sessions and it may very well work for some as a complete relaxation exercise. On our page you can find the main app in case you like what you see in the demo and would like to see more. This is not just a relaxing experience. Dr. Lora Heugens talks about anxiety, how to calm down and feel good about yourself. She talks about common scenarios that normally makes people anxious and goes into details to react to them. She describes how to handle anxiety before, during and after anxious experiences. In one of the sessions she describes the process that will enable you to calm yourself quickly and efficiently anytime. Of course this material includes a relaxing story that you can come back to anytime to calm yourself as well. First you learn the way to breathe properly, followed by the doctor explaining some basics about anxiety. The main story gives us an opportunity to learn the way to look at life experiences as an outsider while going into a deep relaxation state. Then the doctor explains how to utilize the learnings provided as well as explaining what happiness means and how to achieve it. She also gives real life examples explaining different scenarios before, during and after events that usually make people anxious.
