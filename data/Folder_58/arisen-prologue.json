    "About the game": "ARISEN: Prologue is a free playable alpha demo of ARISEN - Chronicles of Var'Nagal . It's a story-driven game in which you express yourself with your emotions, embodied by cards. Your choices will impact the world around you while you unlock new cards. This version of the game contains 15 to 30 minutes of gameplay and introduces ARISEN mechanics and lore building. You have been torn away from your peaceful life by foreign soldiers, then chained in a hold… And now you’ve been sold into slavery on the island of Maccialatt. Thanks to your willpower, your adaptability or your physical strength, you will embark on a quest for freedom.. During your journey, you will cross paths with many people of different races, ages and genders. People whose very lives you may be able to change. Some of them will feel immediately likeable, while others, could surprise you… Will you make friends, have a lover? Or would you rather have enemies, or even a nemesis?... Make decisions with real and increasingly dire consequences. Once you begin your search for freedom, there’s no turning back. Shape the personality of your character choice after choice with “Emotion” cards (Fear, Sorrow, Disgust, Anger, Joy). Replay and try to obtain every existing ending. Enjoy a captivating original soundtrack. We are proofread by two wonderful persons: RKS Consulting about racism and xenophobia, and Johanne concerning LGBTQIA+ subjects.",
