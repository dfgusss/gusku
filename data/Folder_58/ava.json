But now everything is different here, something happened to those ancient forerunners and now this mysterious world is divided in two: the upper and lower. Intelligent creatures live in the upper one, possibly descendants of an ancient people, it is quite comfortable and nice here. But everything is different in the lower one, terrible creatures live there, bloodthirsty predators who do not know mercy, for whom there is nothing more hated than the inhabitants of the upper world!

However, the heroine must find the answers while traveling under the surface of the planet in abandoned and dangerous tunnels!
