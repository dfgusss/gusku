    "About the game": "What can a fantasy hero do when his glory days as a warrior are over? Join Emyr and his friends on a whirlwind adventure to find out! “Barbarous - Tavern of Emyr” is a brand-new time management game unlike any other! Emyr was once the realm’s most famous hero. That is, until his career was destroyed by a dreadful wound feared by all adventurers! Robbed of the chance to defeat his archenemy whom “no hero can defeat”, Emyr awakens in a shabby tavern without a single coin to his name – as its new owner! Sure, Emyr knows a lot about drinking at taverns. But what about running one? Surely this isn’t a role for a leading hero… is it? And to make matters worse, now a teenager claiming to be his daughter has shown up! Will Emyr be able to get his adventuring career back on track? Will he defeat his dreaded foe once and for all? Will he rise to the challenge of responsible parenting? Old habits die hard in this comical adventure! 🍺 Join Emyr on his final quest to defeat his archenemy at last; 🍺 Experience a time management game in a fantasy setting; 🍺 5 unique taverns, each in a different place, visited during Emyr’s travels; 🍺 60 engaging levels, offering hours of unique gameplay; 🍺 120 story-driven cutscenes (intro and outro for every level) mixed with tons of humorous references; 🍺 An atmospheric soundtrack. In this game, you will be tasked with preparing various treats and delivering them to customers. Grab items and combine ingredients into new creations. But be warned - customers have limited patience, and they won’t wait forever for you to serve them! Manage your time well, or you’ll lose clients. Each action is rewarded. Earn points for checking out guests, and earn diamonds as a reward. Good luck!",
