Each mission is a high-risk expedition where danger comes from every angle. Enemy fighters, flak guns, poor weather, low oxygen and an array of other perilous dangers await when the wheels are up. Be prepared! Preparation is key for a successful mission. Tag enemy fighters before they reach you, make sure your destination is marked but most importantly, make sure you have the right team for the job. On a WW2 bomber, every role is essential for victory!",
