    "About the game": "Calamity Eliminator is an anime-styled, roguelike single-player deck-building game. An unknown virus called the 'Calamity' has been spreading rapidly in the world since goodness-knows-when. The Calamity can make people go mad and drive them into conflicts that won't end until the world ends. In the meantime, the Existence Management Company has taken on the heavy responsibility of saving the infected planet. The company's Calamity Administrators will guide the pioneers and the pioneers lead the Valkyries in clearing the Calamity. As the Calamity Administrator, you use the Calamity Eliminator to guide the pioneers and Valkyries in defeating the Calamitoids, and stop the calamitous spread. Experience various interesting adventures as you complete missions, which may end up being helpful in your journey. To the pioneers, your existence is like that of a god. Your commands are gospel, and you are the ears and mouthpiece of God. The Valkyries are servants of the gods, and they will carry out any orders issued by the pioneers—mouthpiece of God. It is precisely thanks to this loyalty that the Valkyries can complete seemingly impossible tasks, one after another. Of course, the better you perform, the more rewards you get. No one's stopping you from slacking off and being a lazy bum, but the company strongly advises against such behavior. You will guide the pioneers in summoning powerful Valkyries to complete the mission. You will guide the pioneers in configuring the right commands to lead them into battle. You and the pioneers will live through many adventures and face powerful foes— Do everything to eliminate Calamities! Beautiful, Powerful Valkyries There are many ways for you to obtain Soul Data to enlist the help of the powerful Valkyries. You have several ways to acquire various Valkyries, and they also have gorgeous dynamic portraits and unique and powerful abilities! Meticulous Team Building Create the perfect 6-member team by carefully coordinating unique Valkyrie skills! Dynamic Deck-Building When the game starts, you will receive some pioneer Commands. More Commands can be obtained in many ways as the game progresses. You can also upgrade Commands to power them up. Spectacular Battles Pioneers and Valkyries work together to produce incredible power. Put your plans to the test, and experience the strategy-rich battles! Uncharted Adventures There are many chance events in this game. Get, set, roll the dice! (Nat 1? Oh no...) Roguelike Elements A game world packed with variety and novelty, with tons of Valkyries, Commands, Adventures, and Monsters for you to enjoy. Embark on a unique and new adventure—again and again! Work hard for the sake of the company's future—or for your own!",
