    "About the game": "Captain CigArrr is a third-person game where the player has to focus on completing objectives and killing enemies on different maps. Every time the player completes a map a shop opens where the player can buy one out of three passives using gold that they collected from killing enemies or collecting treasure around the map. When the objective of the map is completed the player gets points towards their total score based on their performance on the map. Then the next round starts. The game is set in a sea with various islands where the player can sail around. On the sea, there are various adversaries that the player can battle and kill. The player can also embark on these islands to collect gold or do tasks for their objective. When the player dies, their total score is shown and is possibly put on the online leader board if it is high enough.",
