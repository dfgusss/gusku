    "About the game": "What makes King of Crowns Chess Online Different? We have a unique in game card collection system where you earn booster packs to unlock in game cards as you win matches. You collect the cards to complete decks that help to increase your score. Even if you do not win, you still earn a basic booster pack that drop fewer cards. As you advance to a 'tournament' club, you can earn rare cards for higher points earned when you play other tournament players. Clubs and Club Ranking: There are 4 clubs based upon your skill level. As you earn a higher score, you can join more advanced clubs. Each club has their own chat box and ranking. Tournament clubs are for expert players and will grant more advanced cards per win when you play against other tournament players. *You must meet the minimum club requirements to join a club (example: Minimum Score and minimum games completed) Score and Player Ranking: An Elo score is granted to every player based upon how he/she competes against other players. We also have a unique score system not just based on your elo score but your total collective wins, the amount of games you’ve played and card points earned through games played. This total score ranks players based upon their total achievements combined and not just their elo average. Your Mastery Score is based upon the total of games you’ve won. Your Seniority Score is based upon the total amount of games played etc. The total score combined with your elo score makes up for your player score which is how players are ranked. Multiplayer and Multiple Games: Because you can have multiple games playing at once, game matches can be played at your leisure. Each player has 3 days to complete a move before the game is considered abandoned and the opponent can declare that game a win. This is to keep all games fair and active. Our match making system is also simple. You can search for players using our Match Lobby, by joining a club or by looking in our global ranking list. Setting your game style makes it easy for players to invite you based upon your playing pace. If you like casual play, you can set your style to casual, if you would like a match to last for no more than 1 day, you can set for 1 day matches, and BLITZ are for players that are looking for quick games requiring moves no more than a few minutes apart.
