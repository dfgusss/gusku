    "About the game": "Tyrannize the kingdom as a fire-breathing dragon who sleeps on gold and kidnaps princesses for fun! Choice of the Dragon is a thrilling interactive novel by Dan Fabulich and Adam Strong-Morse, where your choices control the story. The game is entirely text-based--30,000 words, without graphics or sound effects--and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Battle heroes, wizards, and rival dragons in your insatiable thirst for gold and infamy. Start by dominating a local tribe of goblins, then usurp the kingdom, defending and expanding your despotic regime to annex neighboring kingdoms, incinerating the peasants in their thatched-roof cottages. O, mighty dragon, spread your wings and let your shadow fall over the terrorized nation beneath you! Play as male, female, neither, or an undetermined gender Find and seduce another dragon to be your mate Kidnap princesses for good conversation, to bait heroes, or for a light snack Isn't it a little sexist to always kidnap princesses? Kidnap a prince instead Ransack holy temples, blaspheming against vengeful gods",
