    "Release date": "Aug 20, 2020",
    "About the game": "Deep in the heart of Blomvanspruit, South Africa... Daniel Vleisman is diagnosed with Disconnected Electricity Disorder, after being traumatized by constant power outages. He wakes up in Slashbin Clinic, disoriented and with voices in his head. He will need to maintain focus while being hunted down, using speed and stealth to make his way to freedom. DEDstress is an absurd and comedic, high-intensity thriller, made by an indie team of two brothers. The game's stressful conditions will put your memory and wits to the test. DEDstress is based on the 3-day game jam DIDstress, made by the same team. It should take an average of 4 to 8 hours to complete DEDstress on normal difficulty, depending on playstyle and skill level. There is also a fast-paced infinite arcade mode as an added bonus. This game is supposed to be weird and confusing. So if you don't fully understand what a character is saying, that is part of the experience. Xbox controllers are supported, but keyboard and mouse is recommended.",
