    "About the game": "PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING!!! BEFORE BUYING DREAMS OF THE ELEMENTS, PLEASE READ THE CONTENT WARNING/HEALTH WARNING LISTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS DESCRIPTION INCLUDING WARNING FOR FLASHING LIGHTS! BY PURCHASING DREAMS OF THE ELEMENTS YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD THE CONTENT WARNING AND HEALTH WARNING LISTED, AND THAT YOU ARE OKAY WITH THIS! The world is made up of the four natural elements: Water, Wind, Fire, and Earth. These elements are kept in perfect balance by mystical fairies. However, this long-standing balance is currently being threatened by dastardly forces! Join Aria, Lyle, Gray, and Kaze as they journey across their world to save it from a maniacal plan set into motion by a group of devious and unpredictable villains! Dreams Of The Elements is a retro-themed JRPG inspired by the classics of the 90's. As the player, you will control a team of four party members, each identifying with one of the four natural elements of water, wind, fire, and earth. Over the course of the game each party member will level up and learn new spells, but there are also fairies hidden in caves and lakes scattered throughout the overworld that will gift the party members with a choice of one of two special abilities to be used in battle. The player can only choose one ability from each fairy per playthrough of the game, giving the game some replayability if the player wants to try different skills upon a second or third playthrough. Also hidden throughout the overworld are optional dungeons and boss fights to be found. Akin to classic PS1 JRPGs, exploring the overworld beyond where the game tells the player to go will reward the player with optional dungeons and boss fights, including superbosses and dungeons even tougher than the final dungeon of the main story itself. Of course completing these dungeons and defeating the bosses will result in better gear and items for the player! The story itself focuses on a group of four warriors who wish to save their world. While the plot seems fairly straightforward upfront, there is a very deep, rich lore supporting a running story that encompasses multiple themes such as friendship, determination, sorrow, and pain. The story quickly develops into a deeper experience in which the heroes and villains see character progression and development, Whether you enjoy a deep story or personalizing gameplay abilities, Dreams Of The Elements offers something for every JRPG fan! Thank you for taking the time to look into this game, and I hope you enjoy the journey that lies ahead! PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CONCERNING GAME CONTENT AND HEALTH/SAFETY!!!: Like many video games Dreams Of The Elements consists of flashing and shaking lights and screens which could cause potential health issues including epilepsy. Please be aware of this before purchasing this game! Dreams Of The Elements was created with the intent of making a video game that could be enjoyed by multiple age ranges. As such there is no language or gore. HOWEVER, there is fantasy violence in the game, with a few scenes reflecting dark themes, cartoon and animated skeletal remains clearly distinguishable from real life, suggestive themes such as a few enemies with somewhat revealing outfits, as well as one scene in a tavern in which alcohol is directly referenced by an NPC, and another NPC is clearly impaired. While some people of younger ages might be able to handle this, and this game is in no way rated by the ESRB, I as the creator would personally equate it to a 'T for Teen' Rating or '13+' for these reasons. Please make sure that you are aware of this and are okay with it before purchasing the game! If you have any questions concerning specifics please email the link in the description. Thank you for your understanding! CREDITS: The following list of credits are that of the RPG Maker VX Ace and DLC packs for it purchased through the Degica Shop.
