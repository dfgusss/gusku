Having tracked the many previous sightings and abductions taking place over the years, world leaders have determined that the approaching fleet are sinister in nature. It is projected that their fleet will arrive sometime in late 2017. In response to this global crisis, the US military was forced to disclose a top secret military project they had created during the Cold War.
