    "About the game": "Alone no more update is here! We finally have added AI (Artificial Idiots) to the game! Now you can finally play by yourself against bots, if you don't happen to have friends. The game doesn't require a controller to play anymore either! Also, we have a new game 'Hockey World Championship 95' in the game, where you can experience how an Ice Hockey match is in its true form! You can join our weekly Dev livestreams at 16:00 GMT every wednesday on Youtube here: You can join our discord to come discuss with the devs / other community members here: Cheers! -Firetail Games Crew ----------- Drunkenpants is a game where ordinary heroes who got drunk in their underpants at home (a.k.a. Kalsarikänni) try to solve mundane problems with excessive violence. The game is an action based, fast-paced multiplayer battle game, where you compete in different game modes and try to beat your opponents. Your character can move, dodge roll, melee attack, use all kinds of different improvised special weapons, drink alcohol and launch an ultimate attack when drunk enough. Revolutionary Game Modes such as: Master of the Tv-Remote Fight for who is the master of the TV remote, inside a suburb flat with your freaky friends. The one who gets to change the channel 10 times first, will win the round. Meatpie Mayhem Collect enough coins next to a barbeque restaurant and order a meal before the other players to win the round. Price is saturated based on how many players are fighting to order. Improvised Special Weapons such as: Nailgun A little bit tweaked version of a proper construction tool, this one shoots massive nails with massive velocity. Disemboweler 9000 A very handy circular handsaw that gives you speed boosts and wrecks everything in your way. Potato Cannon The longer you charge it, the bigger the potato. Penetrates everything and destroys everything in its way. Playable Heroes: NEW HERO: Larry Salaminen Loves sports, but never does it himself. Wears a hockey helmet to protect himself from all the trouble he accidentally gets into. Recruit Ritva An ordinary female soldier, that likes to use a foldable shovel in battle. Likes to wear a winter hat indoors to warm up her cool head. Pekka the shaman Got rabies from his pet fox, that has given him extraordinary superpowers to use in combat. The pet fox fell in battle, but its memory lives on Pekka's head as a nice hat for now. Lalli the farmer The ordinary farmer in a very interesting overalls that combats anything in his way with his mighty axe. Christmas Goat The real Santa, who doesn't bring any presents, just uses his bag filled with bricks to cause havoc to fellow people. Likes to cross-dress under his festive garments.",
