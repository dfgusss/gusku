    "About the game": "Save your pet Duck from a time paradox in this Pixel Art, action, bullet hell, platformer. Shoot bouncing bullets to kill corrupted versions of your duck. Slow down time to maneuver in a flashy way as you try to solve puzzles under pressure and chain explosions to rescue the original version of your pet Duck! The Game includes 10 increasingly difficult levels + an endless Survival mode to test your skills and try to survive as many rounds as you can. The gameplay revolves around precision platforming, aiming, and shooting strategically. If you shoot carelessly your own bouncing bullets will kill you. React accordingly to the different types of Ducks attacking you. The goal in each level is to find a different version of your Pet Duck and bring it back to the Time Machine to advance to the next level. This will sometimes require you to explore the level and even solve some puzzles under pressure to find your way to your beloved Duck.",
