    "About the game": "Discover a world brimming with humor, interesting characters, and adventure. Interact with overly observant villagers and egotistical wizards. You'll find yourself in a role more significant than a knight could ever dream of! Any true hero can call upon trusty companions in their time of need. New strategies can be explored and singular pronouns laughed at when you bring along a friend! Play through the entire game alone or with a friend, the choice is yours. Play online with friends anywhere in the world using Parsec! Get ready for a tower defense game that takes an uncommon approach to player interaction. Slash goblins with your sword, roll through waves of enemies, and build towers as fast as you can. Collect coins from fallen foes, but be careful not to get hurt when maneuvering through the action! Use nine powerful towers to build a strong defense, each tower more unique than the last. Upgrade your character as you advance through the story with a plethora of game-enhancing abilities. Anything unlocked in your skill tree will also apply in co-op mode, so everybody benefits! Unique towers, exciting abilities, and planned future game modes ensures you'll be back for more. The whole experience is wrapped up in an unbelievable composition that contains everything from sweat inducing chiptunes to comedic ambience.",
