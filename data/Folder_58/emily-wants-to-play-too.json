    "About the game": "Emily is back with all new scares in Emily Wants to Play Too. Much larger than the original New characters New games Linear and timed sections No gore or violence Survival horror with stealth and strategy It's about 7pm on Friday and you are headed to your next delivery destination. You work for Timmy Thom's Fast Sandwiches and tonight your job is to deliver sandwiches from 4pm to 11pm. Your next stop is an interesting location. It is some sort of crime research facility where evidence from crime scenes around town is processed and stored. What you didn’t know, was that three very strange dolls were recently brought there for processing and storage. These dolls aren’t ordinary; they have a mind of their own. Your night is about to take a turn for the worse, and it will be one of the strangest and scariest nights of your life. Emily Wants to Play Too is a survival horror game with stealth and strategy elements about a sandwich delivery guy that gets locked inside an evidence processing and storage office building by living dolls. The dolls have 'work' to do here and are gathering new friends. They didn’t expect you to show up, so don’t get in their way. Throughout the night you will be looking for an exit out of the office. At some point, Emily will join in on the fun, along with the dolls’ new “friends”. You better play their games or else! Learn what you have to do and be on the lookout for a way to escape.",
