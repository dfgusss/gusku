    "About the game": "Welcome to Excursion. Excursion allows a tabletop role playing game to be visualized and played over the internet. In Excursion, you are able to: Create dungeons. Play through said dungeons with other people. Become in control of everything (If you're the host). Create and wield limitless weapons and items (The limit depends on how creative you want to be). Choose from 10 character skins (workshop content may be possible at some point). Meme to your hearts' content. Keep in mind this game requires multiplayer for the best experience. Future plans (NOT GUARANTEED): Probable workshop support More music tracks (custom tracks also possible with workshop support) Translations You know what works and what doesn't; don't hesitate to give ideas and bug reports at our community hub / If your interested, check out our completely unedited footage of the game play that we used for the trailer at YouTube (it's a 45 minute video) (The programmer is very bad at recording. it will not be the best quality.)",
