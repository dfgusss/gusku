Hire your first stuff, provide yourself with machines and do not forget about recipes, you will need them for production. At first, it may seem that the market economy is playing dirty tricks with you, but as soon as you become more experienced entrepreneur, you will have to play by its rules and hammer such simple terms as 'demand' and 'offer' into your head Choose your own way of technology development. Potentially, your small nail factory can grow into a large carmaker or even a factory where modern satellites are manufactured. As you work hard your qualification and your stuff experience will grow. Labor veterans are capable of much more than green newcomers. Use their experience for the benefit of your own business.
