    "About the game": "Fancy Skulls is a challenging first person shooter with procedural generation, permanent death and distinct art style. Intense and tactical combat, unique weapon mods and items that change the way you play. Foes different not only in visual design but also in their behavior. For example there is an enemy that will teleport every time you hit it, or enemy that leaves bombs that home on you, but you can shoot those bombs to use them against it. Usable items and power ups, like friendly sentry, an eye that lets you transmute items, kite that lets you fly, matchbox that ignites all foes around you, and much more! Each weapon is different from another, and every weapon can be modded with options that provide interesting game experiences like 'walk backwards to get ammo', '12 hits with no misses give you money', 'last two bullets in a magazine do double damage', 'don't spend ammo while in the air', 'shoot lightning bolts with shotgun'.",
