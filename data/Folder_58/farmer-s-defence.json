    "About the game": "Start off as a simple Farmer: plow, plant, water, and harvest your plants. Slowly weeds start creeping and spreading threatening to destroy your plants and take over your farm. Armed with your bare hands you will have to pull out all those weeds before they get out of control. As time progresses it will become increasingly difficult to fend off those weeds. There are upgrades and tools in the shop to help you push back. How long will you last before the weeds take over your farm? How much money will you have by then? Features Pay attention to your plants’ condition. To get the most money for a plant you will have to harvest it just in time. Sell your plant while it’s still fresh otherwise it will begin to rot. Keep a vigilant eye on the creeping weeds. Once the weeds grow out of control and start becoming thick, it will be much more difficult to get rid of them. Invest your hard earned cash on Fertilizers, Herbicides, upgrades and better tools.",
