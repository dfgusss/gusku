    "About the game": "When two handsome young men spot the perfect girl to be their first model and help make a name for themselves, they're determined to go for broke and make her shine—but first they'll have to get her out of her house! Can these two really give such an anti-social recluse the makeover she needs to be a star? Or will she be the one to change them in this off-beat romantic comedy? Ema Tachibana is a tall, gloomy and unsociable girl with a bad case of resting bitch-face. With all that working against her, she's never really had any friends. At school, everyone's too scared to approach her. But Ema herself is quite content with that state of affairs. In fact, she was all set to spend the rest of her time until graduation invisible as ever... That is, until two men turned her life upside down! 'It's you... I've finally found you! You are, without a doubt, MY MUSE!' Miki Hiraizumi—recently returned to Japan from abroad, he's loved making clothes ever since he was a little kid. He has a strong desire to help make charming, unusual women shine. (He's also a bit of a masochist.) 'Listen up, twerp! You're no good the way you are now. But even you have some potential to shine... I'll just have to polish you up!' And Saito Shinjou—he frequently finds himself bored because things have always come easy to him. He aspires to accomplish something so big, it'll change the world. (He's also a bit of a sadist.) These two ambitious and attractive fellows decide to give Ema Tachibana a makeover! But Ema has other ideas. 'Yeah, well... Who asked you?!”",
