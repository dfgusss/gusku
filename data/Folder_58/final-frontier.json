    "About the game": "The design brief for this game was quite simple: 'Create the most advanced strategy game yet seen on a home computer'. The scenario was unimportant - game play was all that mattered, the computer opponent had to be the most intelligent. The controls: Total simplicity. The players learning curve: Steep. Addiction factor: High. Visual appeal: Vital. Possible strategies: Endless The result: FINAL FRONTIER. Quick to learn but hard to master, FINAL FRONTIER is a fast, full icon operated 1 player vs computer strategy simulation not unlike a real time chess game where the player can design his own pieces and structure his own moves. A game of infinite permutations, FINAL FRONTIER takes game play to the limits.",
