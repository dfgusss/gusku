    "About the game": "*****Smooth Locomotion has just been implemented***** Front Defense: Heroes, the latest installment to Fantahorn Studio’s arcade hit Front Defense, brings you more intense and fierce FPS action from World War II. Prepare to immerse yourself in authentic battle environments and the use of 1940's-era weapons in this 5v5 online single and multiplayer VR shooter game set during World War II. Designed and developed specifically for VR by Fantahorn Studio from the ground up, Front Defense: Heroes offers intuitive controls, sprawling battle maps, realistic vintage weapons and the opportunity to engage in realistic military operations. -------- Front Defense: Heroes allows you to play alone or team up with friends: Solo - Join a match or fight alongside against AI bots. Multiplayer - Form teams and fight against each other in epic battles supporting up to 5v5. Discuss tactics through real time voice chat and win through strategic teamwork. Combat Modes: Free-For-All: Players fight against each other by wiping out as many enemies as possible. There are no allies. Team Deathmatch: Join or form your own team and win by killing enemies on the opposing team within the time limit. Offense and Defense: The two sides take turns playing offense and defense. The offensive team needs to have tactics to destroy a designated target at full force while the defensive team needs to guard their base and fight-off their opponents. -------- FEATURES Classic WWII Weapons You will get an arsenal of authentic vintage WWII weapons to do battle with! Rifles Assault rifles Snipers Bazookas Grenades Sub Machine Guns Locomotion Controls: We developed the unique V-locomotion, which gives players a 3rd-person, out-of-body experience in controlling their avatar through the battlefield. This highlights the immersion of tactical movement for covering each other and fighting the battles strategically. However, you prefer smooth locomotion that is also an option in the game setting menu. Authentic Battle Maps Run around old European streets, factories, and even graveyards as you engage in exciting deathmatches, fighting alongside your friends to decimate the opposing team. Upcoming Features The development team is working hard on delivering the free locomotion, more weapons, maps, and game modes!",
