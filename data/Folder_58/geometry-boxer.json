The Cubemen and Octahedrons, two unique factions with their own geometric attacks, such as the Cube-Stomp and Octahedron Whirl An advanced, motion-captured, animation driven-physics system that creates hilariously verbose combat scenarios An array of melee weapons including hatchets, crowbars, fire hydrants, and much more 2-Player co-operative mode for the entirety of the campaign (2 controllers required) Xbox 360/Xbox One/PS4 controller &amp; mouse/keyboard support ...and much more!
