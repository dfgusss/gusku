    "About the game": "A world will be generated. It will contain vast oceans, snow covered mountains and bare deserts. It will be inhabited by different cultures, brutal pirates, noble intellectuals and everything in between. They will all have one thing in common: the struggle to survive in a world overrun by the the undead... This is a sequel to the game Grim Nights. However, many things will be very different . This game will focus less on tower defense and much more on your villagers and the management of your growing settlement . Villagers will have different skills, backgrounds and relationships. They will eat, sleep, fight and work. Sometimes they will be obedient and other times the grim world will break them and force them to turn on eachother. PS: The game is very much in development, so this description and the screenshots reflects that.",
