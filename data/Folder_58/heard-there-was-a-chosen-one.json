    "About the game": "Yes! And The Dark Lord is after you right now! No matter where you go or how much distance you travel; you will need to watch your back! In this top down adventure you will explore through a different generated map each time you play with enemies to fight using real time combat, along with using bows and bombs! The game only ends when The Dark Lord is defeated or when you die as if you do; it's back to the beginning! You can find treasure and supplies through exploration along with special stamps which get added to your collection for every boss you defeat! Only you can save the Land of Hexile from this evil, but it won't be easy as you will have to fight through the world against all the craziness that it has to offer! There are many forces that will try to stop you! The Dark Lord has an army that has covered the land to slow you down, keep you occupied and battle against you! All with the purpose of allowing the evil grasp of The Dark Lord to close onto you! But don't worry, I can provide a basic run down of what this insane land will throw at you: A randomly-generated world! Eight biomes which exist scattered throughout the Land of Hexile! Ten different enemy types, each with their own mechanics! Giant golden bosses that represent the enemy types that you will encounter! The Dark Lord, which is always moving towards you! Always. Seems like you're ready for this! Wield the Ancient Bow, the only thing that can harm The Dark Lord! You will have to move quickly and avoid The Dark Lord at all costs so you have a chance of being victorious! Look for treasure so you can become stronger and destroy the evil enemies to get supplies to fight back, especially the giant golden enemies! It's all up to you, Chosen One! Save the Land of Hexile!",
