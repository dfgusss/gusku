    "About the game": "------------------ABOUT------------------- Rogue-like action unfolding in a supermarket! Collect various 'resale items' from the supermarkets as you head to the back of the dungeon. When you have some 'Resale Items', the enemy 'Resale Rogue' will attack you and try to steal your 'Resale Items' from you. The timing of the takeaway is also important. Conversely, you can attack the 'Resale Rogue' and snatch the 'Resale Items'. You can also give away 'resale items' to the 'average person' in need. Enemies are powered up by taking 'resale items' from the field. Beware! Let's push your failed resale against them and do some damage! You can also get weapons from treasure chests and change them! You can blow up enemies with your bazooka and fire a series of rounds with your launcher! Each time you enter a dungeon, the map changes. In addition, the BGM will play more than 30 songs at random. A boss awaits at the back of the dungeon! Depending on your actions, the future will diverge and you will see multiple endings. ------------------STORY------------------- In the year 20XX, the year of the calamity, the locusts cover the sky and the calamity afflicts the people. In addition, there is an abundance of 'resale rogues' who take advantage of people's anxiety, buying up the necessities of life and reselling them for high prices. As a 'resale rogue', you enter a 'random' supermarket, where masks, toilet paper, canned goods, and pasta are changed every time you enter, in order to obtain them. Enemy rogues, the resale rogues, are relentlessly trying to steal your cart. Are you really happy about hoarding goods...? Depending on your actions, the future will diverge and you will see multiple endings. Are you a rogue? Or... Your moral compass is now being put to the test. The estimated clearing time is about one hour. This game is a fiction. It has nothing to do with any real person, organization, state or institution.",
