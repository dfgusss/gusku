    "About the game": "...Then try out Idle Wizard! It's an idle game infused with RPG elements, centered around becoming the most powerful wizard the world ever knew. The core aspect of Idle Wizard is choosing a Character Class. You start as an Apprentice, and are able to choose various Classes (12 total, with 6 powerful Hybrid classes later in the game), from classic fantasy-inspired sorceres to more unique magic-wielders. Classes use different mechanics to gain profit, are equipped with unique spells and items tailored for their use. While they're not unlocked all at once, all have use and range in power depending on your current progress and do not follow the simple logic of 'the later it is unlocked - the more powerful it is now'. Pets are a very important mechanic in Idle Wizard. All of them have a unique role and purpose, and most of the time it'll be beneficial to use more than more than one per run. Spells are paramount to your success (naturally!). After you get the hang of basics in the first few minutes, you gain your first spell-scroll and can start casting spells. Their mechanics differ greatly fro one another, from sheer profit or a buff, to meta-spells like speeding up time or boosting the xp of your pets! All the classes use a combination of common and unique ones, and sport quite a few possible combinations. Later in the game you can unlock and craft Items to help you profit even more - over a hundred total! Experiment with different item sets and loadouts to find the best one for the situation. Amount of available upgrades, achievements, and various more complex mechanics like Challenges, Trials, Catalysts and Expeditions allow for secondary goals and ways to boost you even more. There's much to learn and explore!",
