    "About the game": "In a virtual pixel art world, a hero unknowingly will face the darkness that rules over all the creatures. Kbyte is a platform/puzzle game made in various styles of pixel art, ranging from 8bit to 16bit; it is a graphic journey through all the ages of the video game industry, so it uses both modern and classic game dynamics. In its mechanics the best of action platforms and the puzzle are mashed up, with enemies designed to achieve a dynamic and fun game experience, as well as challenging level designs that will make the player want to pass them over and over again. Each world is unique, and uses the graphical and musical environment to allude to certain ages in the video game industry, going from the 70s, 80s, 90s and early 2000s.",
