    "About the game": "A story driven medieval fantasy adventure. You awake without any idea of who you are, where you are or what has happened to you. Explore this dark, cold world as you try to answer the questions you have. Solve puzzles and complete quests for strangers who may be able to help you. Where are you? Find books, manuals and diaries that will give information on this strange land. Using blueprints and raw materials to help you craft useful items and weapons will give you progression and using items in a clever way will allow you to complete tasks with ease. Who are you? Other characters have their needs too. Helping them could be the key to your own discovery of who you are. What has happened to you? Solving puzzles will allow you to find out much more about how this all happened to you and more importantly why.... A small development team of just two people have developed this first episode, and will continue to release further episodes that will expand the story with many twists and turns awaiting on your journey. Discover more about the world, your place in it and how you lost your memory. Each episode will have a focus relating to the world, it's characters and the player's place in it. Episode one shows you the world, how crafting items and finding information in texts can help you understand it. Episode two will be directed more towards, the characters and the story of your place in Lightmare Castle.",
