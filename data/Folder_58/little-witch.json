    "About the game": "This is a Metroidvania game without battle,using the resources in the level to solve puzzles and collect clues. Put out the fire with water drops, feed hamsters, collect stars, open the channel, and let the protagonist return to the real world as soon as possible. The roads in the stage are complex and shuttle back and forth between the two worlds. The methods and ways are not unique. The rational use of maps and archiving are very important. As soon as ronsio, the trouble loving little witch freshman, arrived at school, she was left to sleep in class, but she was still restless after class. She mistakenly entered the treasure room, was attracted by the crystal ball and fell into the world of paper. Help the little witch and her little partner: Kitty Zien explore the world of paper and find the way home. This game is the first game developed by myself only. Please have a good time.",
