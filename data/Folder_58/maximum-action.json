    "About the game": "MAXIMUM Action is the stress ball of first-person shooters. If you are looking for a story-driven narrative with complex characters then this is NOT the game for you. But if you are looking for a quick dose of highly replayable slow-motion gun-fu with homages to classic ’80s and '90s action flicks then MAXIMUM Action might just be the retro FPS you’ve been dreaming of. No complicated skill trees, leveling up, or drawn-out cutscenes, just pure fun that gets straight to the point. Where MAXIMUM Action shines is in its emphasis on creativity and replayability. The entire game has been designed as a sandbox for the player to experiment in. From simply approaching levels with different combinations of dives, slides, and kicks, to a fully-fledged level editor allowing players to create action in any way they see fit. Further, use the sandbox menu to replay levels with different combinations of weapons or add more enemies to up the challenge. Getting the best experience out of MAXIMUM Action requires a bit of creativity and imagination from the player, and I understand not everyone is up to the challenge! But if you’ve always wanted to play a role in your own balls to the wall action movie then I’d say give MAXIMUM Action a try! -George Mandell ACTION TO THE MAX!",
