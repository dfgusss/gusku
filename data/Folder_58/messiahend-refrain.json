    "About the game": "Basically, it's made with dots and a resolution of 1280*720. (There are some parts that are not dots.) It's an action game with a cute little girl exploring the stage. It's a little different from Metroidvania, I think. It's a combination of exploration and clearing, divided by four. You can proceed without exploring, but you can't go to the next area without defeating the boss. You can get items by exploring, but they are not necessary for clearing the game. There are no gimmicks such as switches to open doors. What was the Messiah's end...? It's a mystery that's not really told in depth. It would be nice to be able to move a cute girl in an action game! It's a product of 'Yes! Notes The game is created using Action Game Tucool MV. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. Please make sure to check the trial version. Please make sure to install DirectX 9.0c.",
