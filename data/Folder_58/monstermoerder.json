    "About the game": "Our planet was sucked into the Blackhole 300 years ago and miraculously came out the other side. It appears to be the same Earth we loved and thrived on... or is it? In this survival game you will go through the ranks starting at Monsterlehrling up to being a Monstermörder. Mission The Einrichtung taught you how to survive and now it is time to help the Schwarm Volk at the Bienenstock. Explore the earth, collect resources and build yourself a home. Use the Employee Manual for important information that the others reported to help you. Those that have made it through the ranks have reported things from nightmares and fairy tales: Werewolves and Big Foot. The most unsettling thing is that die Leute have changed. We have found colonies of die Leute that are mutated, they don’t speak much and they are not extremely dangerous. There are others though, the Metzgerei, they are to be shot on sight. Die Leute can provide valuable resources and information. As a Monsterlehrling your responsibility is to the Einrichtung . All Monsterlehrlings are sent out to survive on their own till you can move up to the ranks and reach Monstermörder. Beware Earth is a very hostile yet beautiful landscape. There are many things that we are still not sure about. It is up to you to traverse this harsh new environment and compile data. Is this Earth the same? Can it sustain human life? Can you survive? It appears as if the moon and sun have changed. We are unsure how this impacts the plants and animals, and need your help to learn more. NOTE : It seems as if the planet was completely knocked off its axis which has caused the day/night cycle to be altered. The only thing we know for sure is that when it's night, it's almost impossible to see your hand in front of your face. We hope you stay safe and look forward to moving you up to Monstermörder.",
