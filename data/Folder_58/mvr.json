    "About the game": "MVR is a VR game where you can surf, climb, or use your arms to move yourself around in Community or Official levels. Compete in these levels leaderboards to get the best times, or just try to beat the most difficult ones to increase your rank. The more difficult the level, the more stars you get for finishing the level. You will be able to create and upload your own levels, or play levels from the community. More Official Levels, Movement Modes, and other things are currently being worked on. Currently supports Quest 2, Rift S, and Valve Index.",
