    "About the game": "This Game is a card oracle simulator. It's a game that could change the way you consult an oracle. You might use it occasionally out of curiosity, but it's meant for people who believe in and use oracles. The game features three types of oracles: Gypsy Deck, Tarot and Runes. You can add your own decks if you have the card images. Choose your Oracle and go to the game area. In the game area you have access to all the cards of the chosen oracle. You can shuffle and draw cards from the top, middle, or bottom of the deck. There are two methods of shuffling: Manual and Automatic. None of the methods use random patterns. There are 4 game modes that affect the size of the cards and the maximum amount that can be placed on the table. On the table the cards adjust from the center but you can adjust them manually by dragging them. The way you will consult and interpret is free within the cards limit. It has a size adjustable camera tool that you can generate images of the cards laid out on the table. It has fields to type the cards in case you need to search for one or more specific cards. You can only play one oracle at a time. There is also the possibility to change the table background image. The cards don't contain meanings, it is important that you already have knowledge about the oracle you are going to consult. We do not offer any description of the meanings of the cards, it is important that you already know the meanings. Based on what you believe, your knowledge and intuition, you can consult the available oracles and take a picture of the table to keep it or send it to someone else. Or if you prefer, from a consultation with a physical oracle, you can type the cards to appear on the game table and take the photo and share the image.",
