    "About the game": "A nostalgia inducing authentic action game drawn in pixel art style. Control the protagonist NOCE, using her energy sword, sliding, double jumps, wall jumps, roof grabbing and 'cloud weapons' (unlocked upon clearing each stage) to carve your way through 5 vastly different and unique planets. Utilizing the characteristics of her cloud weapons will be key to clearing the game. Some will protect her, others will create footholds and of course, some simply deal lots of damage! Standing in Noce's way will be a variety of enemy characters and awaiting at the end of each stage epic boss battles with diverse attack behavior! Use your technique and the cloud weapons and step up to the challenge. You can continue from where you left off at any time, so even if you're are not confident at action games, you should be able to complete the game. For those that still have trouble, there is a SHOP on the title screen where you can enhance NOCE's abilities. Set in the vast expanse of space, a rich story filled with attractive and eccentric characters will unfold before your eyes. After clearing each stage, hidden elements, visuals and text will be unlocked and parts of the story that were not so clear will become so. You can check these out any time via MEMORY on the title screen. Search for hidden items and unravel the mystery behind this story.",
