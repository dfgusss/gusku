    "About the game": "Note (September 22, 2021): After working on the game non-stop for 5+ years, and releasing 119 weekly updates, I'm currently taking a break to focus on some family stuff (renovating our house, training our new puppy, etc.). I have reduced the price temporarily during this break. I will return to updating One Hour One Life soon! --Jason Note (June 18, 2019): This game is being updated weekly. That means it's going to change, a lot, over the next few years. The game is already playable, feature-complete, stable, and chocked full of content---it's already an entertaining and interesting game. However, my goal is to make the very best game possible. In a large-scale multiplayer setting, it's very difficult to predict the group dynamics that will result from a given change, so there will be some experimentation along the way. You may not like every change that I make, but you should know that I'm working hard and doing my best to explore this brand new design space, and we'll hopefully end up, eventually, at the best destination possible. In the rare case where a given change ends up being completely disastrous, I always act quickly to fix it. There are hard problems to solve, and with your support and input, we can solve them together. That is part of what you are buying when you buy this game: a seat at the table around a game that is changing and improving week after week. Thanks for your input, trust, and support during this process! --Jason Note (March 13, 2020): Over the past two years, the game has been updated 92 times, with a total of 2812 new objects added, for an average of 30 new objects per update. Some weeks, when I was focused on fixing other things, very few new objects were added. Dozens of new things are not added every single week, but dozens are added on average. The game is updated in a substantial way every single week, however---except, obviously, when I'm sick or on vacation. The trailer depicts a potential future for the game. There aren't robots in the game (yet), but there are loads of things that weren't shown in the trailer (radios, airplanes, rail carts, oil rigs, ice cream, etc.) At least 2812 things weren't shown in the trailer, in fact. For a game that's changing weekly, a trailer gives you only a general idea of what the game is like, and where it's headed. The current plan is to get up to robots in the game someday, but, like I say in the trailer, who knows where we'll end up? --Jason Description A multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building. Get born to another player as your mother. Live an entire life in one hour. Have babies of your own in the form of other players. Leave a legacy for the next generation as you help to rebuild civilization from scratch. Hey folks, I'm Jason Rohrer, and I've been working on One Hour One Life for more than three years. I've been doing everything myself---I drew all the graphics on paper with pens and markers, I coded the entire engine from scratch, I composed and performed all of the music, and I even made all of the sound effects. It's a very personal game, and it's really unlike anything else that's out there. It's also a huge game---over 1300 fully interactive, craftable objects already. And it's only getting bigger, with weekly updates adding new things all the time. The game was initially released on my own website in February of 2018, and over the intervening months, I released 29 updates off-Steam. I've promised to keep releasing weekly update for at least the next two years, with the end goal of making the largest, most comprehensive crafting game in history. Okay, so what about the game itself? First of all, you only live for an hour, where each minute marks a passing year. You join the game server as a newborn baby, and some other randomly-chosen player is your mother. You depend on her for your survival. And why will she be willing to waste her valuable time and resources to keep you alive? Because she's going to die in an hour just like everyone else, and if she wants what she accomplishes in her lifetime to have any meaning, then the next generation (aka, you) is her only hope. And if you survive into adulthood, you may get the chance to have babies of your own---other players, just joining the server---and those babies will be the next generation that gives meaning to your own life accomplishments. Across this ever-growing family tree of generations, players are collectively conducting an enormous project: they are rebuilding civilization from scratch. The online game world starts out as a near-infinite expanse of wilderness (four billion meters wide from east to west, and four billion meters wide from north to south, with a total surface area of over 18,000,000,000,000,000,000 square meters, or 36,000 times bigger than Earth). The very first player to join the server is Eve, and she starts out in the wilderness as the root of the family tree. Eve and her immediate offspring lay the foundation for the future civilization, perhaps making a few primitive tools, cooking basic foods, and starting a small farm as they scrape out a meager existence before dying. Future generations will build on this primitive foundation, eventually mastering more and more advanced technology, including domesticated animals, metal working, permanent buildings, and transportation networks. But as real-life history has shown, civilization is fragile. A generation that is born into the lap of luxury---on the backs of their ancestors' hard-won accomplishments---can just as easily squander their inheritance as build upon it. Key resources run out over time, so careful management, planning, and organization are necessary to prevent an inevitable collapse. Thus, the game graduates from the individual challenge of primitive survival in the early stages to a group organizational and leadership challenge in the later stages. How do rules and procedures for group survival propagate across multiple generations? What did our great grandparents have in mind for this village? The main mode in the game involves being born as a helpless baby to another player as your mother, but you can also play with your friends as twins, triplets, or quadruplets. One baby is hard enough to take care of---any mother that can successfully take care of quadruplets deserves the eternal gratitude of you and your friends. All of this is happening on my own centrally-managed, persistent servers, and your purchase includes a lifetime account on these official servers. After you buy the game, you can instantly connect to this world with no configuration or server set-up. It all just works. You also get access to the full source code, including the server code. Technically-minded folks can run their own private servers, or even use the powerful content editor to make their own mods. I hope you'll join us as this sprawling civilization-building experiment continues to unfold. Many thousands of players have already collectively lived over 400,000 hours in this endlessly-changing world so far. Before the Steam release, the average playtime for each player was 17 hours, with dozens of players logging over 500 hours each, and 94% positive off-Steam player reviews. This is a deep and rich game already, and there are still hundreds of content updates to come. No two lives are ever the same, and a new story always awaits on the other side of the [GET REBORN] button. Jason Rohrer October 2018 Davis, California",
