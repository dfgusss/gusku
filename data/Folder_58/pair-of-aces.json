    "About the game": "Inspired by 1980's arcade games, Pair of Aces is a fast-paced action game where you throw all you have at the enemy fleet in order to sink their ships before they escape. Play solo or with a friend in same-screen co-op mode to sink convoy after convoy of the enemy fleet, or play head-to-head Dogfight and sink your opponent's carrier before they sink yours. Drop bombs and enemy wreckage on the ships to destroy the superstructure and punch holes in the hull, get help by destroying sea-mines which will punch three holes in the enemy's hull, right at the waterline! Aim your bombs carefully and avoid the enemy flak cannons -- they will throw you off-course. If you crash, don't worry: you have an infinite supply of fighter planes, but you can't fight the good fight while you're sight-seeing in a parachute.",
