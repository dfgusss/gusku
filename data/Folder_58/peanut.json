    "About the game": "Peanut is a small cute corgi with an adventurous attitude. A classically styled 2D platform adventure game with an indie zest with an intriguing storyline. Peanut comes home to find is BAE gone and a ransom note from the evil Veronica Vet. To thwart his archenemy, he must travel the world and undo what the Vet has done and gain back the love of his life! Along the way he questions the places and characters that he encounters and why BAE was taken from him in the first place. If you love classic platformers than this should be ideal for a nostalgic thrill spliced with aesthetic levels combined with an intriguing story, some of which requires your interpretation. 45 Levels of game play, with level completion must be carried out before the time limit. not a puzzle platformer, more a puzzling story platformer or corginoir (but cheerier!). Level by level you get closer to BAE and closer to the truth.",
