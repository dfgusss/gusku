    "About the game": "Pooplers is a multiplayer game where up to four players take control over babies. Toddlers do not belong to the calm ones, as soon as nobody watches them, they crawl around the house, pooping on the floor. The player who 'color' most of the map wins. The game is diversified by power-ups and a mother who refers each toddler to a cot as soon as she sees her child pooping on the floor. Staying in a cot reduces the chance of winning in a given round. A humorous game, however, has a number of elements that diversify the gameplay and allow you to create tactics. Poop your way to victory! Visit beautiful maps, to poop around. House, farm, seabed or even space ship. Choose different game modes such as: PVP free for all pooping Team vs Team pooping Zombie horde co-op Play as a parent vs pooplers Play silly football match as a toddler! Play with Friends or learn new tactics alone, with bots. Poop in!",
