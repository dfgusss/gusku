    "About the game": "Team up to operate a starship and explore a randomized galaxy falling into chaos. Each player assumes a role aboard the ship: Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Weapons Specialist and Engineer. Coordination between your crewmembers is essential to survive the perils that await you. Control the various stations that run your ship. Reroute power between ship systems, operate turrets, run powerful programs, scan enemy vessels for information to give you an edge in battle, or start up the warp drive to escape a fight you cannot win. The strategies you use are up to you—or your Captain. Embark on missions, investigate abandoned stations, and scavenge for components that could aid you in your voyage. Teleport down to the surfaces of planets where you may face extreme environments and dangerous creatures. Trek across the galaxy, and discover what lies on its fringes. Online co-op multiplayer (1 - 5 players) Offline / singleplayer mode Customizable AI crew bots in online and offline mode Five unique classes; everyone plays a role on the ship Fast-paced and tactical ship-to-ship space combat Teleport to other ships, planets or stations to join the away team Loot planets and stations for valuable items Board enemy ships to capture them or destroy their systems VR mode (with motion controller support)",
