    "About the game": "Road Making 'ReRoad' is a Tower Defense game with a brand new concept where the players dig their own paths. You need to consider the locations of the randomly placed towers of the stages as well as the towers you will build and strategically create a path. A battle to find the enemy's origin. There isn't enough power to wipe out all the enemies at once. You must lure the enemies out little by little to strengthen your power and gather information about them. Killing powerful enemies might give you a clue as to why the robots have gone rogue. Tactical Retreat Once the Decoy is destroyed, you must start the battle again from the first scouting zone. But don't give up yet. If you understand the enemies' attributes in each scouting zone and apply a strategy, you'll be able to kill more enemies. Clearing the game once doesn't mean you've finished. 'ReRoad' is working on various content developments. Even if you've cleared the game, you can still try out numerous strategies such as upgrading the towers in different ways or using new inventions. Also, if you choose different drones, you can challenge the enemies with new skills and towers.",
