    "About the game": "WARNING: This game contains moderate flashing lights, and bright particle effects, if you have a history of photosensitive epilepsy please be cautious. Note: This game was created by a solo developer! I have done a lot of internal testing, but if any issues are encountered please reach out to me and I will fix them as fast as I can!! Additionally all audio in the game is 100% royalty free and may be used freely in both recording and streaming. :) Revisitor takes place completely inside of a virtual world known as the ‘Revisitor program’. It consists of a series of missions designed to test out the effectiveness of two different forms of teleportation in various simulated scenarios. You play as Subject-01, the very first user to attempt the Revisitor Program. Will you be able to successfully complete it? Return Teleportation: The first type of core teleportation is the ‘Return’ teleport. You may place a return point at any location you desire, and then go back to that exact position any time you would like. Blink Teleportation: The next form of core teleportation is the ‘Blink’ teleport. You may rapidly teleport a short distance towards any direction you are aiming at. Using these teleportation abilities, make your way through a variety of different levels in the Revisitor program. Levels will have a variety of different features including… Special Panels with unique effects. Interactable Access Nodes. Gates and Barriers to get through. Power Cells and Teleport Cells. Obstacles to navigate across. There are also quite a number of unlockable secrets hidden amongst certain levels. Players will be able to unlock: Special Missions. Revisitor Logs. Challenge Objectives. The further into the Revisitor program you go, the more new and challenging objects you will find. Create your own self-checkpoints, and close great distances with the Return teleport. Quickly navigate through various platforms, and avoid danger in tight spaces with the Blink teleport. Uncover the secrets of the Revisitor program, and become the first person to successfully complete it!",
