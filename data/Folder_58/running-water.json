    "About the game": "You play as subject ID #0076101, a synthetic creation of sentient water made by a tyrannical A.I. that runs the facility. Your purpose is testing of a chemical compound known as AN-G3L, enhancing your natural speed and reflexes while performing different tasks under its influence. During standard testing an error occurs and you are released unexpectedly into the basement where you must run, jump, climb and fight your way thru each floor for your freedom using the tools found along the way. Running Water lets you explore each floor as you make your escape thru its puzzles while finding precious resources, power ups and technology to survive your battles against drones or even the facility layout itself. But beware, no subject is allowed to leave alive. Can you survive as a runner? Choose from 3 difficulty settings with unlockable modifiers, a speed run mode and a unique aptitude test mode. Customize your character in the lab and choose between 17 unlockable outfits that can be found hidden in the levels. Collect bubble gems throughout the game giving access to many machines you will find during your escape. Battle drones and turrets as you force your way thru the facility and eventually face off against each of the master A.I. who have one focus, stop you. Search for hidden power ups in each level giving effects such as extra lives, regeneration, double jump and more. Gain access to your tech and then upgrade it by finding scrap or creating it by destroying enemies. Find chipsets that you may mix and match for customizable game play, then eventually create these yourself choosing their effects.",
