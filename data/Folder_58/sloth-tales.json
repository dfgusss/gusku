    "About the game": "Jimmy the Sloth embarks on his own magical adventure. Think Lion Quest, but with a sloth. Sloth Tales delights and inspires with the following features: –A mighty-fine and very free platforming adventure. Where you play as Jimmy the Sloth. –Dash and high-jump powerups redefine play with new ways to explore. –A light amount of story – just enough to leave you wanting more! –Open-ended design where the levels can be played through in any order. Plus a small amount of randomness ensures no two Sloth Tales are exactly the same. –Soundtrack is a brand-new song by the band Falcon Ave. – perhaps their catchiest one yet. –––– Approx. playtime 30 mins (maybe 1hr if you take your time) Sloth Tales is a standalone adventure, but it's also part of the upcoming and even-more amazing game Lion Quest Infinity. Please look forward to this release in 2021!",
