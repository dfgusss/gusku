When you've had your fill of adventuring, you can build up an outpost to serve as your base of operations for crafting and sending your followers out on missions while you're away. Your friends can also set up outposts which you can visit and help out.

Customize your character and outpost with thousands of combinations. More Features in other expansions Stratos Stratos is a world of floating islands, fragmented and strewn across a seemingly-infinite sea of clouds. Although it is unknown whether it has always been this way or whether the islands were once a part of something far below, Stratians are well-adapted to their setting. Societies have been established on the largest of the sky islands, and their peoples have learned to use flox--the very mineral that keeps their world afloat--and other natural resources to their advantage.",
