    "About the game": "Stifled is a multi-award winning, Sound-based Stealth Thriller, where SOUND is the only way you SEE and the enemies HEAR your fear through your microphone input. We won a bunch of awards for being weird and different. So we're strutting it. Unique echolocation-based graphics and innovative microphone-enabled gameplay. Step into the shoes of David Ridley, a man whose mind is slowly fracturing under the weight of heartbreak, turning his world dark. A world where sound gives a glimpse of your surroundings but also attracts the attention of grotesque and terrifying creatures lurking in the dark. Stifle your screams, because the enemies can hear you through your microphone. Complete your immersion (and possibly scare yourself s***less) with Virtual Reality. We support Oculus and VIVE headsets. If Stifled seemed familiar, well it is because its Spiritual Predecessor, Lurking has been played by some of your favorite let’s players!",
