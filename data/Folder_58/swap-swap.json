    "About the game": "4 balls (Ed, Tru, Miles &amp; John) were captured by Gnark Gnark an alien coming from far far away. He brought them to 'Swap Swap' a labyrinth world with evil mechanisms to study their specie. Rules of 'Swap Swap' are simple, but don't fall into the trap, appearance can be deceptive. Help our 4 friends to get out from this evil world using switches, teleports, bumpers and many machiavelic tricks... Be very careful, walls will certainly swap their positions to help you... or not. Swap Swap is a very addictive puzzle game. Get them out with a minimum of moves and be the best of the ones who have what it takes... to free their balls ;-)",
