    "About the game": "NOTICE: This Mod requires a valid installation of Rising Storm 2: Vietnam . Talvisota: Winter War is a community created full conversion mod, utilizing the majority of core gameplay mechanics from Rising Storm 2: Vietnam to explore an entirely different theater of war not often seen in video games. To create a battlefield that feels different from the base game a lot of work has gone into both brand-new content and features, as well as aspects that veterans of the series will immediately recognize: FEATURES - WEAPONS Talvisota features a widespread arsenal of period-accurate Soviet and Finnish weaponry of all types, for example: BRAND-NEW WEAPONS Suomi KP/-31 SMG L1935 Lahti Pistol Lahti-Saloranta M/26 LMG 'Kasapanos' Satchel Charge Panssarimiina M/39 Anti-Tank Mine Dyakonov Rifle Grenade REMASTERED CLASSICS SVT Semi-Auto Rifle Nagant M1895 Revolver F1 Grenade Maxim HMG FEATURES - VEHICLES When the Soviets crossed the border, they brought with them an armada of different armored vehicles, from light transport tractors to gargantuan heavy tanks. This mod features the following: T-20 'Komsomolets' Armored Tractor T-26 Light Tank HT-130 Flamethrower Tank T-28 Medium Tank Drastically different from the helicopters of Rising Storm 2, these behemoths require players to work together to properly and effectively utilize. Single crewmen cannot drive and operate the turret at the same time! Meanwhile Finnish players have a variety of handheld anti-tank weapons and traps, including the renowned Molotov Cocktail. To keep up with the mechanized Soviet transports, Finnish soldiers are issued Skis that can be used to quickly cross open terrain. FEATURES - MAPS The mod launches with 11 unique brand-new maps by community authors: Aittojoki Boreal Kollaa River Kuhmo Outskirts Mannerheim Line Mantsinsaari Island Raate Road Salla Summa Suomussalmi Tolvajarvi AND MORE! Full voice acting for both teams All-new ambient music Historically accurate character customization options New commander abilities &amp; fire support",
