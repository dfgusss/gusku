In January 1980, a young and ambitious treasure hunter finds an ancient sanctuary hidden in the depths of an impassable jungle. While exploring the temple, he discovers untold riches and powerful ancient artifacts. However, getting out of the temple with the treasure turns out to be quite a challenge. The sanctuary is full of intricate deadly traps and its dark labyrinths abound in bloodthirsty beasts hunting for new souls. Multiple skeletons scattered here and there are a sign that the temple had been visited before, but let no one out alive. The protagonist has no other options but to do everything he can to avoid the fate of his predecessors. Our hero is accompanied by a mysterious grumpy ghost and an ancient stingy genie. These two unworldly creatures gradually reveal the details of the terrible events that unfolded at the Temple of Spikes centuries ago.
