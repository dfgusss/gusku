    "About the game": "Tetracosm. It's the story of a curious cosmos you explore as Pseudo, a little not-quite-definite yellow raptor thing. Explore diverse environs. All colorful and unique, some dangerous, some pretty chill, and all connected under an uncertain fate. Experience an odd story. Soak in some otherworldly lore and see what fate has in mind for this universe. Befriend some curious characters along the way. Some are pretty helpful. Some are pretty available-for-chatting at least. Power up using the things you find along the way. Acquire helpful and destructive abilities. Overcome platformy obstacles in your path. Run, jump, swim, dodge, duck, sleep, and DESTROY all that oppose your progress! Fight bosses! And regular enemies. Maybe they just hate the color yellow? Discover secrets. There are quite a few. They might help out.",
