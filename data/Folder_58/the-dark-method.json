    "About the game": "There are two options offered with different experiences to gamers. Either choose 'The Dark Files' option with randomly generated mansion to exorcise the hauntings or choose 'New Game' to jump into the story driven 10+ hour campaign where you get to explore scary environments, solve classic adventure game style puzzles and battle monsters along the way. The Dark Files WARNING: Unlike the story option, these exorcisms are created to be scarier and more heart pounding experiences. What does Dr. Dark do outside the main story? He does more exorcisms! The randomly generated mansion will keep you guessing each time you play as you try to collect all items required for the exorcism. Find keys to open locked doors, find the secret passage to the ritual room, and hopefully conduct the ritual before the haunting catches you. All items, keys, corridors, rooms etc. are randomized so each time you play, you’ll have a unique scary experience. Story The story is focused on shooting monsters, solving puzzles, and exploring varied environments while following a story. This is the option for people who prefer an adventure rather than a jump-scare experience. Demonic possessions? Haunted dolls? They’re real. And the only way to fully exorcise this evil is by entering into the 11th dimension. You play as Dr. Dark, who discovered this secret from a demon by successfully performing an exorcism on himself. Now named after Dr. Dark, “The Dark Method”, is the only known way to fully exorcise evil. Dr. Dark’s work has drawn the attention of certain government officials and is now asked to perform an exorcism on their behalf. But little does he know, there's more to this request than what meets the eye. FAQ - Snap Turn and smooth turn options available - Free locomotion and teleport (teleport only available in campaign) options available - The game does NOT support Virtual Desktop, Oculus Quest users please use Air Link for wireless gameplay - OBS might crash game if you don’t have enough memory - I personally haven’t tested the game on Valve Index but according to community feedback it works. - Yes there is autosave, so if you die before reaching the next checkpoint you start from the most recent checkpoint. - To continue from where you left off; shoot the continue tombstone at the start menu and the game will load from the most recent checkpoint.",
