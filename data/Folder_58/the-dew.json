    "About the game": "'Dew Number 17, once missing, has returned. What truths lie beyond this bygone clash between black and white?' The Dew is a puzzle game focused on storytelling. You will become a dewdrop—experience the past wars fought by black and white in puzzle form, and uncover the neglected truth. In a simplistic environment controlled by only the arrow keys, new rules will come into play as the levels pass by, presenting new challenges and requiring the player to apply both old and new tactics. Can you, as a new drop of dew, solve every puzzle and discover the truth?",
