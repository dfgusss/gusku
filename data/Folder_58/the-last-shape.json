Adventure Through the Looking Glass Finally spirits of the dead have been reincarnated as the last shape, that was a little cube, which gave them an ability to see what they've done when they were alive in a different light.

At the end all spirits leave the last little cube behind and disappear. Features: Classic 2d hand-drawn platformer with all the modern trimmings. Created by one person.
