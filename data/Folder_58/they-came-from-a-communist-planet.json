    "About the game": "They Came From a Communist Planet is a first-person adventure game about depression and revolution. Stuck in a cycle of debt and isolation, your world suddenly changes when aliens reach earth carrying a message of socialist insurrection. Fight your way past water cannons, tear gas, and riot police, as aliens help guide you to a future beyond capitalism! Key Features: A short, sweet adventure game, lasting roughly 30-45 minutes. Throw trash, bricks, and Molotov cocktails as you riot in a destructible late-capitalist neighborhood. Receive messages from UFOs above as you experience a chilling tale of senseless greed, engineered depression, and the aliens who might offer hope. Use protesting abilities to explore and unlock new parts of the city in this Metroidvania-Lite. Search alleys to find hidden spray paint canisters and see what secrets they might unlock.",
