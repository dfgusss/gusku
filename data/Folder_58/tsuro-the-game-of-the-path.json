    "About the game": "Create your own journey with Tsuro: The Game of the Path . Place a tile, and slide your stone along the path created... but take care! Other players’ paths can lead you in the wrong direction - or off the board entirely. Paths will cross and connect, and the choices you make affect all the journeys across the board. BEAUTIFUL The intricate artwork of the original board game is brought to life with fluid animation and sparkling pyrotechnics. Every component has been recreated in meticulous detail, including the box! PLAY WITH FRIENDS Tsuro supports up to 8 players, around one device or online. Play against your friends on desktop, mobile and VR, or go solo to see who can build the longest path. EXCLUSIVE NEW MODES Classic Tsuro, plus 4 new ways to play, exclusive to the digital version: Solo, Fuse Mode, Loop Battle and Longest Path. FUN FOR EVERYONE Tsuro is easy enough for anyone to pick up... but it requires cunning and strategy to become a master. CRAFTY AI OPPONENTS Choose from 3 AI personalities to challenge your strategic skill. MASTER THE DRAGON Over 50 achievements put your path-building skills to the ultimate test.",
