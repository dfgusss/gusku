    "About the game": "● Train Simulator VR is a VR game that you can operate train. Even though trains are very familiar to us, almost all people have no chance to operate trains by themselves. For that reason, not a few people seemingly wants to try such VR experiences. Those who have wanted to operate a train from your childhood! You can now sit and operate train in the motorman's cab that you have dreamed until now! Let's have a VR experience in this chance!! ● Let's operate a train that makes you feel the Showa era! Current Japanese train maneuvering is the lever type, but in the past trains were operated with a mas-con handle and a brake lever. Its operation seems to be complicated, but as you repeat playing, it will lead to the 'fun' inherent in railroad games. (Showa is the era of Japan and refers to the period from December 25, 1926 to January 7, 1989) ● Always fun no matter how many times you play!! Since it is a good old-fashioned operation method, it takes a lot of time to run a train. First, place your 'right hand' on the brake lever and pull the trigger of the controller in your right hand. You can grab the lever, so turn it clockwise. Next, place your 'left hand' on the mas-con handle on the left side of the screen and pull the trigger of the controller in your left hand. Grab the handle and turn it clockwise to run the train. When you get used to these operations, you should feel exactly 'operating a train'. The feeling of immersion increases every time you play. ● Thrilling incidents occur one after another! While the train is running, you will be prompted to 'lose speed to 35km/h' or 'stop by the signal!' on the screen. At that time, release your hand from the mas-con handle, then grab the brake lever and turn it counterclockwise to decelerate and stop. ● We will not arrive at tomorrow just by running The event which is indispensable for railway VR game is 'to stop at stations'. A green line and a red line are drawn at the back of the platform. The green line corresponds with 'distance to go', and you have to stop the train at the point of zero distance to the line. This is the railway VR game that purely expresses the element of 'hard but can't stop' that the current game industry has forgotten.",
