    "About the game": "Wobbly Jungle looks incredibly sweet, but it will drive you to the brink of insanity! That's because in Wobbly Jungle the wolf's in sheep's clothing – erm, sorry... in Sina's enemies! You have to survive 60 challenging levels that will demand everything from you. The sweet look is actually crystal clear camouflage, as a variety of enemies and obstacles lie in wait. Are you ready to face this challenge? Only those who demonstrate perfect timing and fast fingers stand any chance at all – true to the motto 'SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST!' In addition to the 60 increasingly difficult and varied levels, lots of challenging enemy types await you, as well as a rewarding 'surprise' at the end. Some enemies can be defeated; others you're probably better off avoiding – preferably without stumbling right into the next trap. Varied and exciting: 60 challenging levels await you Gleeful: See where other players died and leave them behind you Challenging: Whether or not you finish the level is entirely in your hands Smart and forward-looking: Many enemies lie in wait – it's probably best to avoid them. Confrontational: Compare your skills with those of your friends with the level summary",
