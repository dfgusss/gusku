    "About the game": "Deep in the heart of the cosmos, champions from every corner of the galaxy gather... for a game of minigolf! Eons ago, it was but a simple sport of stick and rock played in a backwater asteroid belt, but as the years went by, the game was squished, squashed, stretched, squeezed, and set on fire until it became the game known across the galaxy as... Wonder Wickets ! Some play for leisure and others play for honor, but most just play as an excuse to travel the stars! What sort of wacky competitors will you meet? Treacherous obstacles, troublesome foes, and special powers breathe new life into a simple game! Local and Online Multiplayer lets you challenge another friend In 1 on 1 matches! An adorable art style that’ll melt your heart! 18 unique playable characters, with alternate and unlockable costumes! Featuring guest characters such as Commander Malloc from 'Aliens Go Home Run', Remedy and Frallan from Ludosity's 'Princess Remedy' series, and even ToeJam and Earl from the titular games dating back to the 1990's! Over 60 Star Orbs skins! A HUGE level editor so you can make your own Wonder Wickets courses! Soar through the cosmos in Wonder League or Galaxy Crossed modes, and explore several distinct planets, each with their own courses and challenges. As you play, you'll discover special courses in the Challengoid Belt to push your skills to the limit! There are also hidden prizes for the more seasoned players to earn by mastering these single-player modes! Play two-player Local Versus with a friend on the same computer, or over the internet via Online Versus ! Play together in one of the 4 different versus modes! You can even throw in subscribed levels from the Steam Workshop! Versus modes include: Wonder Versus : Race to the Black Goal to sink your ball first... but not before collecting enough points! Stardust Machine : Collect as much stardust as you can and deposit it into Stardust Machines! Cosmic Conquest : Use your Star Orb to conquer a solar system! Seize control of the most worlds to win! Battle Splatter : It’s time to paint the town red (and blue)! Cover the course with your color to claim territory! Use the Level Builder to make your own courses with all of the same tiles, foes, backgrounds, weather effects, switches, music, and game modes present in Challengoid and Versus levels! Upload your level to the Steam Workshop for others to play. Player-made levels can even be used in Versus mode! Discord Rich Presence : Share your current activity and stats with others on Discord! PNG Level Export : Export your custom level as a .png file to share with your friends!",
