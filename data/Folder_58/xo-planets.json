    "About the game": "A rogue-lite , action platformer , tower defense , with a little rpg all in one. As an action platformer, you can double jump , dash , and even climb a wall up and down while using a one-handed weapon. But all of those must be unlocked via Distro Machine using the unit component . As a rogue-lite, every level is random procedural generated. That means every game session is different. It also features permadeath, so everything that you work really hard for will be gone when you die. Well, with exceptions.. And that brings it to rpg element which can be turned off if you so desire. The very rare Xolyriums can be collected and can be spent on upgrading your reconnoiter. And finally, the tower defense. This one may be a little too hard at first, but with patience, skill, and strategic preparations using gun turrets, missile launcher, or a tesla tower you can do it!
