    "About the game": "At some point people realized that a bunch of folks chasing after a ball on flat ground is a little boring, so they came up with a new sport. One that still requires players to wear shoulder pads and helmets, and tackle each other. Welcome to Yahrit! Yahrit! is a platformer fighting game with local multiplayer for 2-4 players. The rules are simple: you can run, jump and dash. The tricky part is that you don't get to shoot or slash - the only way to hit your opponent is to charge right at them! What to expect Local multiplayer for 2-4 players (SERIOUSLY, NO SINGLE PLAYER MODE) Fast paced gameplay Easy to grasp platformer mechanics Generally a good party game Cleverly combine running, double-jumping and dashing to trick your opponents Beautiful handcrafted pixel art Full controller support (verified to work with XB1/XB360 and PS3/PS4 controllers) Up to 2 players can play using the same keyboard 5 stages (currently) and 3 modes (also currently) What NOT to expect No career/campaign/story/single player mode No frustrating prompts popping up whenever you just want to quit the game",
