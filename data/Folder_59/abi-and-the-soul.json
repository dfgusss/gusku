    "About the game": "Abi wakes up without memory on a somewhat strange island, perhaps somewhat magical, where thanks to the help of a celestial light, she will be able to overcome various puzzles and reach places never thought of. Undoubtedly a story of love and fantastic friendship where you will have to discover the mystery of the place and recover all your memories by finding small fragments scattered throughout the island. Play with the two characters. When you play with 'soul' you can move freely around the place, to anticipate dangers, activate magical mechanisms and help Abi in various situations. When you play as 'Abi' soul will follow you to protect you and guide yourself in any circumstance. When she moves away from you you can call her with a hiss and she will immediately fly to your side. Main features: For fans of Journey, Firewatch and Shelter. An emotional and intimate story by a one-man team with an unforgettable ending. Use two characters with completely different mechanics to overcome puzzles. Enjoy the incredible soundtrack. A short game (about an hour and a half), focused on the story, with a bit of light puzzle solving and platforming.",
