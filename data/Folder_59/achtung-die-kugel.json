    "Name": "Achtung die Kugel!",
    "Release date": "Oct 11, 2018",
    "About the game": "A local multiplayer action game where skills and tactics decide who wins. Each player controls of a 'kurve', a curve that always moves forward and is only stopped when crashing into another object. Whenever an opponent crashes while you're still in the game, you score a point. Get to the score limit first to win the game! Achtung die Kugel re-imagines the old classic 'Achtung die Kurve'. Achtung die Kugel bends achtung-space to kugel-space (sphere-space) and brings the same classic action and skillful gameplay you would expect from an achtung game. Here's what's in the package: - Action packed gameplay : one small mistake and you're out for the round! - Achtung die Kugel is played on a Sphere!! - Jumps! Get out of tight situations or get right in front of an opponent with this skill-intensive feature. - Easy to learn - hard to master : you can only go left, right or jump. But it takes lots of skill and tactics if you want to win the round! - Play up to 4 players in two teams or free for all. - Different maps to choose from. - Xbox controller support . Definitely plays best with controllers! - Party mode . Hate waiting for the end of each round? In party mode you respawn immediately! - Many settings for your ultimate achtung-on-a-sphere experience! We really hope you like it! Konec hry!",
