    "About the game": "Aron's Adventure is a Third Person Action Adventure Game set in the new fantasy world of Elor. An ancient evil re-awakens and so the fate of the land is thrown into Aron's hands. In Aron's Adventure you are tasked with fighting back this evil. You will be accompanied by an ancient spirit that will help you understand your new abilities and guide you in the right direction. Take on your enemies from a distance with a bow or bring it up close and personal! In Aron’s Adventure you get to choose the way you take on your enemies! Archery: Use your bow to take enemies out from a distance. Abilities: Teleport arrow, rapid fire and explosive shot! Melee: Face your enemies up close! Abilities: Stab/assassinate, dash and ground slam! Sword and Shield: Play it safe with the sword and shield! Give yourself extra protection in dangerous fights. Heavy Sword: Need some crowd control? Use the heavy sword but make sure to hit your swings to not run out of stamina. 1H Sword: Perfect for single target combat, give up some defense for some extra offense. Dual Blades: Overwhelm your enemy with quick attacks! Twinblade: When Aron learns how to use the twinblade it will be the most difficult weapon to use but the pay-off is big! Crowd control and high damage, this weapon has it all. As you get better at fighting enemies and as Aron grows stronger, more difficult weapons become easier to use! Difficult weapons may offer you a chance at more damage but they also require you to time your dodges and roles better while keeping a solid grip on your stamina! Aron’s Adventure offers over 40 different enemies to fight! Dozens of different grunts that will challenge you in different combinations. Big boss fights and mini boss fights, every region will throw multiple challenges at you to overcome! From small spiders to zombies and even a dragon! Do you have what it takes to drive back the evil that is facing Elor? Not all you do in Elor is fighting, you will explore different corners of our world in multiple open levels and over a dozen smaller linear levels! Environmental puzzles! Platforming puzzles! Crafting equipment! Enemy encampments. Plenty of sidequests. And more! Every step of the way will help prepare Aron for the threat facing Elor.",
