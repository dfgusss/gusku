    "About the game": "Overview Asteroid Blasters is a modern re-imagining of the classic 80s Asteroid shooters from the early arcades. Asteroids are on a collision course with Earth and the only way to avert disaster is to nose straight into the cluster and destroy as many as you can. Other machines have been deployed to assist in the destruction of the space rocks but be careful that they don't hit you by mistake! Features Choose from 6 ships, each offering a variety of performance differences. Multiple weapon drops will be teleported from Earth. 1 Player or 2 Player Co-Op arcade action. High Score Leaderboards to see if you're the best space pilot. Procedurally generated levels. Old school inertia based physic controls. Full Joypad Support. Save / Load to continue where you left off (Single Player Mode ONLY). Lots of Steam Achievements.",
