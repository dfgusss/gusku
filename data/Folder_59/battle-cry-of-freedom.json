Defeat your enemies using the directional melee combat system inspired by games such as Mount&amp;Blade: Warband, that is easy to learn but hard to master. Realistic Projectile Physics Battle Cry of Freedom realistically simulates real life bullet physics by modelling not only velocity and twist rate, but also takes into account factors such as humidity, temperature, air density, local gravity, wind direction and wind strength. Advanced Artillery System Each of the 20 Artillery Pieces will perform differently and each gun has its up- and downsides. Artillery can be loaded with a wide range of different ammunition . Percussion-fused shells, time-fused shells, solid shot, bolts, canister and case shot can all be loaded, and work as expected.
