With dozens of bombs, hats and level types to master, you'll need more than your love of things that go 'BOOM' to succeed… Bomb Club's gameplay is extremely simple, but you'll soon find out that it can be challenging too. Newcomers will have no trouble progressing through the game, and puzzle experts will find optional objectives that will push them to their limits! There's no place like the Bomb Club for those who love making bombs and watching them explode. But someone seems to have forgotten the golden rule of the club: bombs are for fun, not for evil! They scattered bombs everywhere and it's up to you to stop them… Join Maggie, Ian, Jon and Blake as they try to identify the culprit and clean up this mess the only way they know how: by blowing stuff up! Meet the Laser bomb, the Black Hole bomb, the Magma bomb, the Smoke bomb… There are more than 20 bombs to discover , each with their own effect. Being an expert artificer is no easy task... But the Nitronomicon will always be at hand to remind you what they all do. Years of bomb research are compiled in this book, so keep it close! Hats are the pinnacle of bomb technology. Put one on a bomb and it will get a new effect! With the Party hat, the Hard hat, the Top hat and other fashionable headgears, you'll never lack options and your bombs will never lack style! More than 200 hand-crafted levels are waiting for you, with different level types. Choose your path, explore the map at your own pace, and unlock new stuff as you progress. There is much to discover, and hours of explosive challenges to overcome. Who knows what's waiting for you at the end of it all?",
