    "About the game": "You play Roger Herberts - a Buildings Health and Safety Inspector. He is also a letch who treats women as commodities on the rare occasions when he gets the opportunity. Then one evening he meets a mysterious old wizard in a bar who determines to teach Roger a lesson. The old man tells Roger he will be rewarded with $1million if only he can go 24 hours without engaging in sexual relations with a woman. Easy, right? Wrong! There's a catch. The old wizard casts a spell of irresistibility on the hapless protagonist, causing hordes of horny women to pursue him in this raunchy retro-style platform game! By the same developers who brought you AI Anomaly . Features: Run, jump, climb, use hand-over-hand manoeuvres and slide down poles 'fireman-style' as you battle through the action-packed levels. Visit a variety of different locations heaving with ladies intent on bagging you! Encounter moving and rotating hazards galore! Use moving or static platforms with different properties; some helpful, some not so much! FOR LEGAL REASONS, THE DEVELOPER OF THIS APP HAS REQUESTED THAT THIS APP BE WITHDRAWN FROM SALE AND HEREBY GIVES NOTICE OF ITS REMOVAL. SORRY FOLKS!",
