    "About the game": "Run, jump, block and trap your friends in this local multiplayer platformer royale! This party game has an easy objective: stay on the screen longer than your seven opponents to win! There are four different game modes to choose from: Round, Score, Collect (competitive) and Distance (cooperative). The level is never the same twice, it's automatically generated. You'll need to stay on your toes to keep up! You and your friends are Bits inside of a CD player. The music plays, the laser flies by, the level builds itself and you need to get moving! If you fall behind, you're out! Someone is operating the CD player. Those buttons on the CD player will change everyone's gameplay! You'll see Fast Forward, Shuffle, Slow Motion, Repeat and Next Track occur, try to keep up! CD-RUN can be played in: English, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, French, Italian, German, Japanese, Spanish, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Chinese (Simplified) and Korean! Call seven friends or family members or co-workers to join you in this easy to pick up and play party game. The bigger the group, the more laughs, yells and victory cheers will happen! Please note: plug in controllers to support more than four players.",
