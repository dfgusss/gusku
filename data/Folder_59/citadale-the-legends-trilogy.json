    "Release date": "Sep 13, 2017",
    "About the game": "Step into the hellhouse once again... Citadale - The Legends Trilogy combines the original Wii U release ( Citadale: Gate of Souls ) with two all-new sequels: Chapter 2: Curse of Darkness - Sonja’s Son, Gabriel, takes up the mantle of the Demon Slayer.. Chapter 3: Legacy of Fate - Face the Dark Lord as Christopher – Sonja’s grandson and heir to the Shadow Blade! Fight evil across three generations with distinct storylines, characters, levels and music. A Dark Lord plagues the land ... and only YOU can stop him. Play as Sonja Dorleac and bring an end to the forces of darkness by wielding the legendary Shadow Blade. Battle the creatures of the night with swords, axes, shurikens and more – and face off against horrific bosses. If you prove your strength, you can unlock alternate endings for the first two games in the series. A boss rush mode for the original game can also be unlocked if you get the “good” ending in first game! Features Feast on the 8-bit style artwork combined with epic chiptune music. Defeat creatures of the night! Test your skills against face-melting difficulty. Spend hours looking for secrets and unlocking alternate endings. Enjoy a platformer, action game, and adventure – all rolled into one. Not a Metroidvania. ------------------------------- Controller Information: Due to limitations with the engine, some controllers, for example 8bitdo gamepads, may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard. I apologize for the inconvenience.",
