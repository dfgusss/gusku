    "About the game": "By buying the USF army individually, players who do not yet own any COH2 product can access all existing Company of Heroes 2 maps in auto-match, and play against all other existing factions in multiplayer or through skirmishes against the AI. Under the Command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, US Forces have driven ashore on the bloody beaches of Normandy and fought their way deep into Europe driving back the German war machine. Now battle fatigued and spread out on enemy soil, an army made of citizen soldiers are pitted against a battle-hardened professional military with over four years’ experience. Facing the best Germany has to offer, the US Forces fight desperately and viciously to expand the frontlines. An adaptable army that will bend but not break, the US Forces draws on some extremely versatile infantry and vehicles, while the unique base structure of the army captures the temporary nature of the frontlines. Fast light and medium armored vehicles, like the iconic M4A3 Sherman, provide mobile firepower to support versatile Riflemen, while elite Paratroopers and airpower disrupt enemy plans well behind the front lines. KEY FEATURES US FORCES Wield the mighty power of Eisenhower’s Allied army with brand new abilities and strategies THE WESTERN FRONT Expand the war to the popular Western Front theater of combat, featuring breathtaking new environments, that bring realism and vibrancy never before seen in the game NEW MAPS Eight stunning new maps join the extensive collection of 23 existing Company of Heroes 2 maps as well as over 1,000 community created maps available on the Steam workshop INTENSE ONLINE COMBAT Feel the unprecedented ferocity of frontline strategic warfare and engage in visceral battle with adversaries across the globe EVERY BATTLE TELLS A STORY Experience the up-close moment-to-moment brutality of frontline warfare and control the battle through your military prowess USF vs OTHER COH2 MULTIPLAYER ARMIES Find out the multiplayer army (and associated game/standalone) that suits your play style.",
