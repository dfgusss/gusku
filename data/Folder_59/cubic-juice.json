    "About the game": "This is a game requiring both logic and strategy where the goal is to build solid layers of cubes without empty spaces using given figures with some certain shape. A player gets score with each built layer and this layer of cubes is removed from the matrix. The game may help to develop 3D space orientation skill and may seem difficult for players who naturally don’s have this skill. The game speeds up a bit with each complete layer, but it also possible to choose your own speed of the game via options. I feel some kind of satisfaction and relax playing it. Hope you too.",
