The game features a party based system where you control a group of heroes, an isometric hand-drawn art style, dice based mechanics and much more.

Map Editor: Create new adventures and distribute them through steamworks Multiplayer: Play together with your friends and complete the campaign cooperatively! Turn Based Mechanics: Every turn each of your heroes in your party can take one single action. Play wise and carefully or fall captive in the eternal prison of the sorcerer.
