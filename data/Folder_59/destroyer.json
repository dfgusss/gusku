    "About the game": "The most compelling destruction game made for virtual reality! Use iron balls to destroy mysterious ruins on islands floating in the sky. The limited number of balls means you'll have to play strategically in order to proceed. Designed for the HTC Vive. Features Smash ruins so large you'll have to look up to see them in their entirety. Destroy a certain percentage of each stage to clear it and move on to the next one. Ten kinds of ruins for you to destroy! The higher levels are stricter on the number of balls you get and the completion ratio you must reach. Aim carefully with one controller or make a big mess with two! Either way is a great stress reliever! How to Play Cause as much destruction as possible with as few balls as you can. The most efficient methods will require some planning! Think about where to start so that the resulting debris doesn't block your subsequent shots. The balls can ricochet. Take advantage of this to get a high score! You can adjust the angle of your shots by tilting your head or crouching. Unexpected positions can yield unexpected results. The game is playable from a sitting position, but it's more exciting while standing up!",
