    "About the game": "INDIE FANTASY LOCAL MULTIPLAYER GAME FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY, SET UP ON THE WORLD OF ETERNALIA Two games in one; Classic Arcade mode and First Person Medieval Shooter. There might be a third mode coming if you people like the videogame; a party RPG, integrating the story of the Essence Reaper Ritual with the mechanics of this videogame. You decide! FEATURES AND CONTENTS - Local multiplayer fantasy game, for 1-4 players, sharing same screen. - Steam Play Together. Invite your friends to play with you even if they dont own a copy. - An Arcade mode campaign, to play with your friends or solo. Hack and Slash. - A First Person mode, following the same campaign than that of the Arcade mode. - An Arena mode; gather your party, venture forth and face five waves of enemies, each wave of increasing difficulty. - 5 different characters, each one with their uniques skills and combat styles. - Subttile and menus in three different languages; English, French and Spanish. - Beta version will have one full playable level. As we move forward, up to 4 more leves will be added. - Each level is set up in a different atmosphere, with different enemies. The idea of creating this videogame came in when spending time with our young family members (e.g. nephews and niece) playing a videogame. It should be easy to play, not too many buttons, yet plenty of fun. We are scripting from the very beginning everything to accommodate three languages; English, French and Spanish, so the videogame will be available en those three languages. We just give you for now a video and a couple of screen capture of the first tests. We are thinking on adding a script to be able to import your own pictures to the game, so instead of having the 4 portraits of each character, you may import yours. I bet my niece and nephews would love that. Alpha version of the videogame, actual game play, is working well. Initial early version: integrating First Person Mode on split screen with main campaign, for up to 4 players; GAME CONTROLLERS You may use; Xbox One controllers or similar Keyboard &amp; Mouse LOCALISATION I have been integrating different languages from the very beginning of programming / development. I use Dialogue System from Pixel Crushers which allows easy integration, and for specific short texts as in the Main Menu, I have just hardcode it. Once you choose a language, Dialogue System keeps / save that info for the entire videgame, so upon load an scene, Dialogue System load all previous saved data including language chosen.",
