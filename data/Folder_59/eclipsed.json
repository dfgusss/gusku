    "About the game": "Eclipsed is a monochromatic adventure platform puzzle game. This is a story about a boy who wakes into a world of darkness. He ventures deep into the world ever changing. He finds beauty and mystery in the dark and strange world as well as a girl who seems to be as unique as him. Together they venture forth to rid of the world they are in. The game follows the story of the Major Arcana of a Tarot deck. The game has numerous features such as a variety of puzzles some unique to the game with combinations of it; Semi rogue-like levels that give each computer a set of levels that is unique for each one; A smart AI that you can avoid danger but may still be lead to its death; Challenge modes and YOLO mode that can give a more rogue-like experience with a cost of a life; and more to follow. There is more to the game, as an early access it is still under construction. So please, bare with me as I make more levels and features. Only one person is working on the game with only his free time to work with. Which I am hoping to change.",
