    "About the game": "Play as a lunarnaut/repair-person, tasked with fulfilling the ridiculous demands of President of the World, Doug-Slater Roccmeier, to build his massively unstable elevator. You know, to the moon. It’s in the game title. Obey his increasingly goofy orders to the letter, disobey and cause hilarious havoc, or find your own sweet spot. Each way of playing has its own advantages and outcomes. It’s up to you, intrepid elevator person, to blaze your own altitudinal path...to the moon! Features include: • Brand new Rad-Roomscale mode option! Play in a brand new way! • Immersive, challenging VR puzzles that propel you into the stratosphere • Fully Voiced Narrative Space Adventure! More plot twists and turns than a twisty-turny thing! • Exploration! The elevator has heaps of stuff Roccmeier doesn’t want you to find. • Clever control scheme. Use your favorite controls regardless of room size and setup. • Virtually (heh) vomit-free! Designed to maintain maximum tummy comfort.",
