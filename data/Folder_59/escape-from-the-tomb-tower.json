    "About the game": "Play as an ancient evil that is trying to get out of confinement in an ancient tomb tower. The builders of the tower have long been dead, so you need to overcome only the traps left behind them, blocking the way to the exit. At each level, you will find several logical puzzles that need to be decided what to go on. Test for people who love to break their heads over complex tasks. Some of them can be solved with the help of brute force, but you can complicate your task by trying to solve the principle by which they are built.",
