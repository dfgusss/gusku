    "About the game": "Escape the Living Nebula strikes a balance between deeply strategic turn-based and casual gameplay allowing for a satisfying and challenging strategy game that can be played for short periods of time. Players must guide three ships through ever increasing dangers to escape a nebula coming to life while at the same time battling enemy craft. Give your ships commands using a console designed for mobile touch-screens in a turn based environment then watch the actions play out in real time in a physics-based battle ground. Story mode provides a more relaxed progression through the game while survival and rogue-lite modes provide more challenging experiences with increased variety between play-throughs allowing for excellent re-playability. An unlockable sim mode allows for custom battle design to allow players to hone their skills against the wide variety of enemy craft. Evade enemy fire, charge shields and fire torpedoes.
