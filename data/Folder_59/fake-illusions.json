    "About the game": "Fake Illusions is a collection of optical illusions—but some aren't playing fair! Where straight lines look diagonal, one line actually is, and circles look like they differ in size, but secretly, one one of them is actually bigger or smaller, camouflaged by the illusion. The goal is to accuse these cheating illusions! But beware—the fakers will do everything to stay unnoticed... It's the ultimate test of your focus! Featuring more than fifteen illusions about color, perspective, and movement, with lots of variants and distractions. Try the relaxing Zen mode, or the hectic Shuffle mode! Oh, and you can record GIFs, too! Photosensitive Epilepsy Warning This game features optical illusions, repeated patterns and high contrast images. Stop playing if you start feeling dizzy or sick. Accessibility info Color blind friendly: the game uses mostly greyscale colors, and brightness can be adjusted. Illusions that require you to spot differences in color can be skipped. Textless: Very little reading is required to play Fake Illusions. Autosave: Quit at any time and continue where you left off next time you play. Difficulty: You can freely adjust how much the faker stands out for every illusion. Controls: Completely playable with either mouse, keyboard, or gamepad. Keyboard and gamepad are remappable.",
