Support trading cards. Introduction Fantasia of the Wind is is an adventure puzzle role-playing game (AVG + RPG) produced by Fantasia Group, which is the first game of the Fantasia Series. The engine is RPGMaker MV, supporting controllers, mouse and keyboard operations. It is an adventure story about a girl named Sandra who lived in a small village. One day, she got a magic gem of life in a relic of goddess. But when she returned to the village, she found all villagers were brutally killed. In order to save their grandfather and the villagers, Sandra signed a contract with goddess of time, back to the time point before villagers being killed, hoping to change everything ... ... Length The game will be multi-route design. Our goal is to allow players to get completely different experience during new game+ and new game++. Even the same time point of the same route will be a little different with the game proceeding. The first playthrough will take 5-6 hours, and the second playthough(NG+) will take 10 hours or more. The whole game playthrough will take more than 20 hours. There will be a huge number of side quests as supplement of the main story. We need more content to deliver our fantasy world view to each player. (Note: Side quests, collection elements and challenge elements will also change as the game proceeds.) Performance The amount of scenario text in demo is about 100,000 Chinese words. It will reach 600,000 to 800,000 when finished to ensure a more complete expression of the world view. (We are sorry that we are temporarily unable to count the words in demo of English version because we haven’t finished it yet.) We try to design multiple puzzles and multiple solutions in a same map for players who explore in NG+. When using some special methods to solve the puzzles, players can be surprised to find: How can the solution be so? There is still a thing hidden here? This is completely different from the last time I playthrough! We think explore and discover are two biggest pleasure of the puzzle game. However, players do not need to worry about the difficulty of the game. Puzzles in main story will be relatively easy to solve. So players can enjoy main story without too much pressure. For core puzzle game player, we prepare a large number of side quests and challenge puzzles. Side quests and hidden content can be discovered by some evidence. They will unlock some special achievements. The feeling of complete the challenge which seemed to have no solution must be cool! Characters Sandra The granddaughter of a blacksmith in a small Village. There was no information about her parents, she just lived with her grandfather. She was taught to be kind and honest.
