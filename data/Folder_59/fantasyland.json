    "About the game": "Fantasyland, from one of the four ancient China masterpiece 'Dream of the Red Chamber'. Where are you coming from, where are you going to go? Dreams and realities, reality and dreams. This is an eternal topic. We are in the dream, or in reality. Death in a dream and awakening in reality. On the contrary, you will enter dreamland with layers of layers, and eventually will not be able to tell you where you are. The scene in dreams is getting worse and worse. Everything is so familiar but different. You are the enemy or the enemy is you, you fight with yourself. In this game, there are six stories of dreams, and each dream has a new hero. You need to take the target first to get into the next dream and get the hero in the next dream. Each hero has different attacking and moving speed. You can get a more powerful hero through battle, and of course you can buy it directly through DLC. The enemy in the dream uses the most advanced AI system, and you can engage in intense and exciting battles with them. We have the world's leading UI design to make you enjoy the pleasure. We also created realistic scenes to give people a sense of darkness and depression. There are also realistic smoke, blood and explosion effects in the game. Deja vu, but different music, makes your heart speed up and feel very nervous. These cool particle effects, the shock of the background music, let you in. This is a world view that has never been seen before, which triggering your thinking about life. Welcome to fantasyland, you do not seem to find that in fact you have fallen asleep. Good luck to you.",
