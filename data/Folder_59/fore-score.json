    "About the game": "Fore! Fore Score is a multiplayer miniature golf game, with a twist! Build the hole as you play, alternating between putting the ball and placing hazards on the course, trying to score the most points while messing with your friends! Finishing the hole within the time limit will award you with points. Bonus points are awarded for finishing first, fewest strokes or hitting a hole-in-one! Choose a golfer, then your ball, and start putting! Each round, players choose from a random selection of obstacles to modify the hole. Place down bumpers, windmills, cannons, and blocks to create a new and challenging hole. First player to reach the target score will win! Build the hole as you play Grab a few friends for some couch co-op competitiveness as you compete to be the best golfer. Use Steam Remote Play Together to invite your friends online to a match. Supports up to four players, using either controllers or keyboard configurations (or both!) Controllers are recommended but not required. Notice: This game is meant for multiplayer. While you could play solo against yourself with two controllers or a keyboard... it is meant to be enjoyed with a friend or three!",
