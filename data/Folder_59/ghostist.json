    "About the game": "You have become a Ghostist . Now you need to prove that you are capable of finding and identifying ghosts in several different places. After arrival you have to use your tools, senses and courage to investigate the place and find the ghost. Once you start to notice strange things around you ranging from a faint noise to an immediate attack you have to carefully check for all the clues to identify what ghost you are dealing with. The G.I.C (Ghost Identification Chart) is helping you identify the ghost. Check all the boxes of possible symptoms and it´ll propose possible ghost types. With all the money you earn you can buy additional equipment helping you to locate the ghost, keep the ghost away or just keep the fear at bay. Once you have gathered enough money you may even hunt back and try to banish the ghosts from the places they are haunting. Use the Exorcismkit, collect their bones scattered across the huge and small maps and try to address the right type of ghost-you wouldn't want it to get angry!",
