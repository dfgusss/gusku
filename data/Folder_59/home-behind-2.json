    "About the game": "Home Behind 2 is a Roguelike RPG set in Scaria, a country engulfed in a 10-year civil war. Lead a patchwork group of revolutionary fighters into the depths of the government's territory as you struggle to overthrow a brutal authoritarian regime! In Home Behind 2, we travel back to Scaria, 10 years before the events of the previous game. Ruled by the dictator Akadullah, citizens of Scaria are beginning to call for liberation and revolution. As their voices grow louder, uprisings begin spreading like wildfire across the country. Banan, a college student studying abroad, has decided to return to her homeland to participate in the revolution. With help from Prince, an eclectic agent from the Norto Republic, and Haroun, the disgraced son of a tribal leader, will you be able to face the dangers of western Scaria? Can you evade capture by Akadullah's regime and lead a revolution? Scaria's fate rests upon your shoulders. Explore the randomly generated areas of western Scaria in this Roguelike RPG as you adventure, occupy enemy oil fields, and claim cities in the name of the Revolutionaries. Recruit and train dozens of guerilla fighters. Unlock 36 jobs, each with their own talents, stats, and battle skills, and assign your fighters to your team as you see fit. A strategic real-time combat system. Pause time to command your teammates at any time or use tactics to deal devastating blows to your enemies. Random drops of weapons and armor. Hundreds of weapons spanning from World War II until the modern age await your discovery. Machine guns, flamethrowers, or rocket launchers - which will you mount on your vehicles as your travel deeper into Scaria and confront evermore dangerous mechanized enemies? Build and upgrade a camp for your Revolutionaries, allowing you to assign tactics, cook food, upgrade technologies, and craft armor for your fighters. A variety of unique terrains host hundreds of random events and buildings. Play to your team's strengths as you decide how to solve problems presented by your environment.
