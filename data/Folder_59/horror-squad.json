    "About the game": "It's your job to enter areas where no one wants to step and where everyone is looking with chills. After finding the right job for your team, explore the area. After completing the correct ritual, you must neutralize the creature. You have to work in coordination with your squad and break the curse. A lot of evil can await you in the land you enter. Because for a very long time this land has belonged to evil spirits. Find and use items left by former squad that failed in the territories. Hide from creatures. Look for ways to neutralize them. Investigate all sides. Find items that work for you. Open locked doors and reveal secrets. At some point, things can get out of control. Remember, the old teams said it would be an easy task. Sometimes you need to stand out and become a hero, or you can hide in the closet.",
