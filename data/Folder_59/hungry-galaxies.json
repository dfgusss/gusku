    "About the game": "Space is a dangerous place. Navigate the cosmos dodging everything the universe throws at you to a stimulating electronic soundtrack. Each new piece of star matter you collect will grow your mass. Increase your mass and you'll evolve, reaching new planetary sizes, gas giants and powerful stars. What will you evolve into next? -Use different specials: dashes, shields, and solar flares to gain an advantage in the chaos. -Dodge asteroids, meteors, comets, neutron stars, black holes and more. -Featuring realistic gravity and physics based movement. -Progress through 11 different stages, each with its own set of threats and challenges. -Use worm holes to leap across space. Some leaps will give bonuses, some will make you sweat. -A focus inducing electronic soundtrack to help you get into the flow. -Procedural content: no play through is the same. -One difficulty setting that adjusts as you play — there is no easy way out.",
