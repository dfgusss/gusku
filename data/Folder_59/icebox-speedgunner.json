    "About the game": "OVERVIEW In the spirit of games like SEUM, DEADCORE, CLUSTERTRUCK and old-school DOOM, this game ain't for the faint of heart. Leaning on fast-paced FPS gameplay (ie. no cover-based hiding), ICEBOX raises the stakes by introducing speedrunning, 3D platforming and global Leaderboards . This game's for the toughest of players , not scared of taking on the monumental challenge of mastering the ICEBOX – and becoming the Ultimate Speedgunner . Besides, we've equipped you with a bunch of special abilities and weapons to dominate the Sentinels and their Environment. Your GLITCH ability hands you an unfair advantage by manipulating time &amp; gravity . You'll also receive assistance from an outside hacker – she'll guide you through the ICEBOX as you carve an ice-cool path, cutting corners, dodging obstacles and eliminating guards. And we've included a tutorial to help you master the basic mechanics. So the challenge awaits, if you're up to it. A 20 level campaign , culminating in a battle against the Central AI. Or try one of the procedurally-generated marathon levels up to 100kms in length (including checkpoints). And we've provided other quick-game levels like “Hunter”, “Super-jump” and “Arena” to give you the opportunity at honing your skillz. You'll probably die a lot. You may even want to quit or take a break, and that's ok, we won't judge you. In fact, we've got you covered – with Zen Mode ! Play the game without enemies while listening to the game's dynamic soundtrack for the ultimate chill out. This game is best played with a mouse/keyboard for hardcore precision , but it does also support Xbox 360 Controller. … SO THE CLOCK'S TICKING… Can you “Escape the Icebox” before time runs out? ICEBOX: Speedgunner is a competitive Run-and-Gun 3D Platforming FPS video game ...THE CLOCK'S TICKING… Carve an ice-cool path through the Icebox, cutting corners, dodging obstacles and eliminating guards, as you race through it's digital labyrinth to become the Ultimate Speedgunner.
