    "About the game": "Kazuo Tamara has always been a devout idol fan and is invited to be the fourth member of his school's new idol club. He is excited to meet up with other idol enthusiasts and gladly accepts, but on the first day, the only ones there are the three most dangerous delinquents at your school. They need your help transforming their images in order to become ideal pop stars and win the independent idol contest in Akihabara. A short game with six possible endings and lots of cute outfits. Try not to get on any of their bad sides, or you might face serious consequences.",
