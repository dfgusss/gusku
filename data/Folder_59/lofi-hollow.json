    "About the game": "Lofi Hollow is what some might call a 'roguelife' - an ASCII life simulator, focused on existing in a world filled with people to talk to and things to engage with. Run your own farm, bartend, go mining for ores to make new tools and weapons, solve puzzles, and dig up artifacts! Currently implemented features include (but are not limited to): Combat - Slay monsters to become stronger! Mining and Smithing - Craft tools and weapons! Construction - Build a house or decorate your apartment! Farming - Buy the abandoned farm in town and grow crops or raise animals there! Photography - Capture photos of the world and its inhabitants to earn money or immortalize memories! Modding - Add or change (almost) anything with the extensive modding system! Multiplayer - Do all the above with friends using the built-in Steam multiplayer!",
