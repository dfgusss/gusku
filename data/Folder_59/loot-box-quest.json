    "About the game": "The spiritual successor to DLC Quest! Earn that sense of pride and accomplishment in the way that only repetitive clicking can deliver. It's a clicker game, so chill out, have a few chuckles, and watch numbers get bigger while the industry burns around us all. Features: Lots of clicking. But not, like, too much clicking. You can get upgrades that automate things. Numbers that get bigger. Some numbers that get way big. No, even bigger than that. Sense of pride 1 Sense of accomplishment 2 About this game My secret shame is that I really like clicker games and lose a lot of time to them. I also make games for a living and have always wanted to try making a clicker game myself. This game is part of a challenge to design, develop, and publish an entire game (solo!) in one week and this is what I came up with. There are many clicker games but this one is mine. I hope you like it! Also please don't ruin the games industry. Sincerely, - Ben 1 Unlikely 2 Not guaranteed",
