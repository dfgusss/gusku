This way the magnet can attract or repel certain objects. This mechanism has to be used in a particular way so that the player can advance in the game. Key features: Unique physics puzzle game Easy to understand, difficult to master Atmospheric sounds and visuals Various original soundtracks Full Windows support This game is the result of 13 weeks of development at the Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences.
