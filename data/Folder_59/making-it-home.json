    "About the game": "Making it Home is a vehicle building game. In the story mode you're a ladybug, with family issues, on a journey home. Put your engineering and creativity skills to the test as you combine simple elements into a complex contraption. Once you’ve built it, jump around your vehicle to keep it moving and defend it from an onslaught of cherry bombs, autonomous drones and carrots - or just relax and build your dream machine in the cozy mode ! Design and engineer your vehicle. What you build, and where, matters. Discover new components and your favourite combinations the more you play. Take part in the daily, weekly and monthly design challenges with a limited set of components, or let your creativity run wild in the sandbox mode! In the Story mode pick your route across the USA, getting to know quirky animal friends (and foes) along the way. Explore the interactive narrative while the classic country sound track keeps you in the mood for a road trip. The entire story mode is playable in Cozy mode without hazards or enemies, for when you just feel like chilling out on the drive home. Rethink all your vehicle designs and play the entire campaign co-op with up to 3 friends locally or on-line with Steam Remote Play Together . Share your vehicle designs and discover new ways to play with full Steam Workshop support . Note on Controller Support Controllers are fully supported for the platforming elements but a keyboard and mouse is required to design your vehicle.",
