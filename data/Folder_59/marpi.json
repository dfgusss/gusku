    "About the game": "Relax to an endless generative artwork in a form of a digital art screensaver. This procedurally generated piece is inspired by a mix of imaginary robotics, and abstract, alien like arachnids, crustaceans and insects. Originally a site-specific interactive art installation, now coming to Steam as an audio-visual experience. It's an experiment in randomness, mixing Unity pseudo random function generators, Perlin noise, Brownian motion, hypercubes and trigonometric functions, bringing you infinite shapes and colors. Enjoy a company of ever changing procedurally generated arthropod-like creatures. Watch as they create an infinite stream of physically simulated 3D artworks. Poke and drag the digital creatures using your mouse or touchscreen. Rotate around the scene Featuring a generative soundtrack You can find out more about the site-specific version of this artwork on our studio page",
