    "About the game": "The result of a UCL London Knowledge Lab research project. MissionMaker allows users to design, code, and play custom 3D videogames. MissionMaker is intended to be used in schools by teachers and young students so they can explore literature through the medium of game design. This software is the result of research projects for a Beowulf and Macbeth pack so you'll find a lot of fun items you can add to your game, like Eye of Newt, bats wings, and root of hemlock, along with reptile creatures, trolls, armoured warriors, and broken swords. Designed in Unity by University College London’s Knowledge Lab and the DARE research centre This software allows young students to: - Make impressive 3-D games rapidly - Code rules using the built in Event Condition Action style coding language and Boolean logic - Learn about game design Ideal for Key Stage 3 and above – and has also been trialled with KS 2 students. This software is now being made available through Steam in an effort to get as much feedback and exposure as possible, so that we can continue to build on the software and try to get it into schools. We'd love to be able to continue making this so any feedback we get is hugely appreciated and we really will incorporate as much as we can! If you find the software useful or interesting please let us know!",
