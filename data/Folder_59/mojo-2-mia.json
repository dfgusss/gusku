    "About the game": "'Mojo 2: Mia” is a new version of the famous game “2048”, an original approach to this well-known puzzle. Beautiful Mia will keep you company during the game. The more points you get, the less clothes remain on the girl. Will you be able to make her strip completely? Differences from the first part: Two new tiles have been added (128, 256). New game mechanics (temporary “freezing” and dynamic field). Game process fixation. Having completed half of a level, you will get access to the next level. This will enable you to postpone the full completion of certain levels.",
