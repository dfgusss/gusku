Utilizing dinosaur DNA, science created strong and impressive warriors. Once the war ended, there was no longer a need for the dinosaur soldiers and so they were forced to the margins of society. The only thing left for them to do was to sell their bodies. Always threatened to be discovered and exposed. What was happening there in secret had been strictly forbidden for a good reason. Mutant Alley is a gay first-person sex simulation. You are going to interact with one of their most talented soldier's: The anthropomorphic T-Rex.
