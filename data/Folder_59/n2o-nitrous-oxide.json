    "About the game": "N2O: Nitrous Oxide's gameplay is pure shooter, reminiscent of the arcade classic TEMPEST. You're stuck on the perimeter of a tube and you job is to shoot at everything in your way. If things get too hectic, you can slam on the brakes, which stops your forward movement for a few seconds and gives you time to change your direction or clear a path. Once you've destroyed all the level's eggs, your next task is to take on the game's huge bosses. Graphically, the game is very bright and colorful and definitely exhibits a techno influence. The soundtrack is done by the techno group Crystal Method, who supply some remixes as well as older tracks, which helps put you in the groove.",
