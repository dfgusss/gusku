    "About the game": "English language support is NOW available. What happens to the inhabitants of a game world after you have finished it? In No one lives in heaven the NPCs have been left alone for years and you are the first person to meet them again. All your decisions have consequences and influence the course of history. Will you manage to change the fate of the NPCs for the better or will you become a prisoner of the game yourself? Is your humanity strong enough to stand your ground? No one lives in heaven does not give you a role to play. You are not a chosen hero, who defeats an evil force with the help of his grinded abilities. The role you play is you, and the fate you decide upon is your own. 40 hour campaign with high replay value Over 100 different endings and an almost infinite number of possible game passages, depending on the decisions being made. Over 200 unique NPCs with over 300 individually designed quests and a variety of side activities for hundreds of hours of fun Each player will receive a free copy of the book Encyclopaedia Comédica: A serious journey to funny realms The most comprehensive RPG-Maker game ever",
