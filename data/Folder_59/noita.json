    "About the game": "Noita is a magical action roguelite set in a world where every pixel is physically simulated. Fight, explore, melt, burn, freeze and evaporate your way through the procedurally generated world using spells you've created yourself. Explore a variety of environments ranging from coal mines to freezing wastelands while delving deeper in search for unknown mysteries. Pixel-based physics: Every pixel in the world is simulated. Burn, explode or melt anything. Swim in the blood of your foes! Enter a simulated world that is more interactive than anything you've seen before. Your own magic: Combine spells to create your own magic as you delve deeper into the caverns. Use magic to crush your enemies and manipulate the world around you. Procedurally generated world: Explore a unique world every time you play. Discover new environments as you adventure deeper. Action roguelite: Death is permanent and always a looming threat. When you die, don’t despair, use what you’ve learned to get further on your next adventure. Noita is being developed by Nolla Games, a company set up by 3 indie developers, all of whom have worked on their own projects in the past. The three gents in question are: Petri Purho Petri is best known as the creator of Crayon Physics Deluxe . In his youth he also made a lot tiny freeware games. He has also made a bunch of board games, but he hasn't told about it to anyone. So please keep it a secret. Olli Harjola Olli is known for the award-winning, mind-bending sci-fi puzzler The Swapper . Besides indie games, he also dabbles in music, live visuals and making programming languages. Arvi Teikari Arvi is also known as Hempuli. Over the years he has released a lot of tiny experimental games, so many in fact that he is unaware of all of them. One of the games he remembers making is Baba Is You .",
