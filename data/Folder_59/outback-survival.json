    "About the game": "Welcome to the land down under mate. The world has lost the plot and the end of days is here. You have been tasked with building something that will last. However this is easier said then done. This is Australia after all and everything here wants you dead. The keyword when playing this game is customization. The main goal of this game is to put as much control as possible into the player's hands. You choose your play style. As a player you can build a base of operations. You choose how to furnish your base. You can choose how your GUI looks. You can choose your key-binds and layout. This game also fully supports 15 different languages. An interesting choice that you will get playing this game that you won’t get playing other games, Outback Survival will let you decide if you want to use stylized toon cell shading. So, if you want a more realistic looking game that is an option but also if you prefer to play games that look like a cartoon that is also an option. If you prefer a traditional survival experience where you craft everything you need you can. But also, if you prefer a play style more based around exploration and looting you can also play this way. It is up to you as a player how you choose to play. You can hunt iconic Australian animals for food. Be careful when exploring though, everything in Australia wants you dead and snakes are hard to spot. You will need to fight. The landscape is populated with rednecks that want to shoot your face off. Come test your skills and buy Outback Survival today. Wafflesoft is an Australian based independent game studio of 1. Yes this is a solo project. Yes this is my first project. Don't worry though this is a good thing. Because unlike the big companies I'm here and will listen.",
