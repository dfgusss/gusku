GAMEPLAY Overboard! is a tense, highly replayable detective game from the creators of 80 Days and Heaven's Vault . Blackmail a spy. Fall in love. Murder a rival. Cheat at cards. Drug a witness. Lie, befriend, betray, console, sneak, seduce, steal, borrow, pray, eavesdrop, kill... There are clues, evidence, suspects, accusations, secrets and lies. You’ll need all your cunning, coercion and charisma to ensure that someone else takes the fall. DYNAMIC NARRATIVE CLOCKWORK * Next-gen visual novel : go where you want, when you want, and say what you want * Simulated story-world : other characters move and act independently, remember everything they see and hear, and everything you do * Every minute counts : you have eight hours to escape justice. Time is always ticking * Who can you trust? Some characters are friendly, and some are out to get you. Who will you befriend? And who will you betray? Built using the award-winning ink narrative engine, Overboard! 's narrative twists itself around every choice you make. Play once for a thrill, or multiple times to uncover all the secrets and achieve an ideal ending. One play-through lasts about 30 - 45 minutes, but achieving the perfect crime run will take a lot longer. Can you get away with murder?",
