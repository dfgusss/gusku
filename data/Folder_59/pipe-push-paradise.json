    "About the game": "Pipe Push Paradise is a difficult open world puzzle game about plumbing. You've arrived on a lonely island faced with a hero's calling. The island's plumber has been out of commission for a while and the residents are counting on you to get the water running again. They could all really use a shower. In order to help, you'll need to push, flip and roll pipes all across the island in some of the most challenging puzzles out there! The minimalist tile-based gameplay is super simple but the puzzles are anything but, each offering a unique idea and problem to solve, and filled with surprises and new mechanics. With an art style that wouldn't look out of place in a dusty old travel guide to Puerto Rico and a relaxing bossa nova guitar soundtrack, Pipe Push Paradise is bound to satisfy any serious puzzle lover. Rise to the occasion (push pipes around) and restore this paradise to its former glory! Features: Pipes Tile-based gameplay Dozens of elegant puzzles packed with surprising mechanical twists Lush and relaxing art &amp; music by Teodoro Zamudio Full controller support 'Infuriating' - PC Gamer",
