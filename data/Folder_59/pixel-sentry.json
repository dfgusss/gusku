The brown crates will give you powerups like more health more damage or more attack speed. The Gold crates will give you more powerfull powerups that can be combined with other powerups. And then the red crates takes away 2 health but they have a chanse to give you a really good powerup. Each game is about 100s depending if you speed up the game. And the game has 10 rounds right now.
