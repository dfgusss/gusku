What lies ahead for them as their different ways of thinking, emotions, and lifestyles come together? ■Game Features -Turned-Based RPG Battles combine real time and turn-based combat. Time your blocks correctly to defend against enemy attacks! Read your enemies’ actions and seize victory! -Magic System Become stronger the more you use magic.
