    "About the game": "A roguelike puzzle adventure. We like 2048 and we love dungeon crawlers. So, just for the fun of it, we mashed the two together. RogueSlide is what happened. Position is everything. Gameplay is casual, yet each decision is strategic. Each move presents a new puzzle as you slide tiles around the board, slaying monsters, drinking potions, and casting spells. Survive 3 worlds of unique enemies and obstacles with 5 unlockable characters. Or try your hand at the Daily Dungeon or Arena modes.",
