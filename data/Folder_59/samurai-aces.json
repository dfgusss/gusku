Samurai Aces is a vertical-scrolling shooter game that first appeared in arcades in 1993. The roots of 'Psikyo shooter' are here, with the randomly chosen levels, eccentric bosses, dramatic demo, and the vicious aiming bullets that would later be called 'Psikyo Bullets'. You can set the difficulty level, life, number of continues, controls, screen orientation, and more. In addition, now we have online rankings! Be the world's best Samurai Ace! Characters: Blonde haired kunoichi 'Jane' Turbo monk 'Tengai' Super genius dog 'Ken-oh-maru' Rampaging maiden 'Koyori' Macho samurai 'Aine' Anatomic machinist 'Gen-nai' Planes: Power up with 'P' items, with sub-weapons also added.
