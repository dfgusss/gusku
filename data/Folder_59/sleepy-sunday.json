Escort Nicky, your annoying but trusty companion as you venture your way through a dangerous but charming dream-like world so you can both escape it! Die &amp; Retry Nobody said leaving would be easy. Old friends and new rivals will do their best to stop you from doing so, making your trip quite challenging. Your opponents may also change from a run to another, so don't count on getting used to them! You will probably die. A lot. But who knows, with a bit of luck and experience, you'll probably reach your goal at some point, right? Gather Companions Why go solo, when you can count on your friends to give you a helping hand? Find companions on your way, and have them join your team! When you're not fighting your way through the dream lands, why not talk with them, and get to know them better? They probably have some stories to tell, too! Various Weapons Not only you can count on your trusty baseball bat to help you through, but you might even find a cool alternative with new original weapons such as a baseball bat, a laser gun and a... Yoyo? Friendly Baddies Even though you may exchange a few punches with your enemies, it doesn't mean you guys can't become friends. Have a few words with them when not fighting, and you may become best buddies! Maybe even more... Who knows? Get Trendy Even though you'll probably die a lot, don't expect your efforts to be in vain. Unlock upgrades and original attires in shops and express yourself with cool combinations of clothes and masks! Sleepy Sunday's wacky world is waiting for you! Brace yourself, it's about to get tough!",
