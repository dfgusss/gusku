    "About the game": "You feel gentle a thump as you land in the warm tropical sand. Who are you? Who do you want to be? Something in your heart whispers of shade, majesty, and acorns. What does this mean? Your mother waves to the east. On the far side of the ocean is a world! Plants and animals! Mountains and valleys! Birds and flowers and a forest of mighty oaks. Yes! You know that this is who and what you are meant to be: an oak. Your parents can't teach you how to be an oak. The only one who can teach you how to be an oak is another oak. Still, your parents teach you what they can - the way of the coconut. This will give you the ability to cross to the mainland, and be one step closer to your goal. It's not much, but it's a start! In Sprout , you will embark on a casual, botanical-puzzle-adventure. You will make friends, learn new skills, solve puzzles, and ultimately become the mighty oak that you were always meant to be. Features Friendly puzzles Hand-drawn artwork Botanical soul The ability to sprout into different plants with different abilities Multiple opportunities to travel through the gastrointestinal tract of an animal",
