Explore the Tomb! In Story you are a Skeleton living in an ancient tomb, which is robbed by ruthless adventurers. The tomb has many secrets waiting for you to uncover them. Smash your enemies! There's no one who could escape your vengeance! Kill everyone you find in the tomb (even your own character if you want). Every choice matters In Story every choice matters and has it's consequences which will lead to unexpected consequences.",
