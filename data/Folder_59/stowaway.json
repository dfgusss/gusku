The Ship The ship is based on the Kriegsschiff Revenge, an English ship from 1577. It is fully explorable all the way from the crows nest to the bottom of the ship. Current Roles The Sailor’s goal is to keep the ship on course, make repairs and vote off the stowaways. The Stowaway's goal is to kill the crew without getting voted off or killed by the detective.",
