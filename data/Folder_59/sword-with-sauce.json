    "About the game": "Select your weapon, your gadgets and then your play style as you enter ready to take down all the enemies patrolling the level. To help you along your way is a large selection of gadgets and weaponry to assassinate your targets in any way you like. You can either go in guns blazing, with a mad desire to re-colour the walls red or take a more delicate approach as you sneak your way around the level avoiding detection. Your main weapon can either be a sword which can deflect bullets, chop down your foes or be thrown for maximum bloodshed. A shield which can be thrown at multiple enemies at once or to reflect their bullets right back at them. A bow for silent long range kills without worrying about ammo. And finally a machine gun because sometimes the best solution is the loudest one. You also have a selection of bad ass gadgetry, starting with ninja stars and gas grenades leading into the more ridiculous pocket sized black holes and self destructive crabs. Current Features: 6 weapons (not including the cutlery) 25 gadgets 5 levels 4 enemy types 3 game modes",
