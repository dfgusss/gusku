    "About the game": "That's Mahjong! is a Solitaire Mahjong game where the purpose is to match tiles of the same type, or any two season tiles. It aims to bring people into Mahjong and Solitaire together, no matter of which age group they belong to, or what are their hobbies, and it does that by having a multitude of themes. There's no time limit, but you can always run out of moves, so you will have to plan them carefully. Each pair awards you with 2 karma points. Content (such as themes and levels) will keep being added to the game, but on release it will contain: - 24 themes - 10 levels (tile arrangements) Be careful! Some of these levels can be very challenging! - Steam Achievements - Steam Trading Cards (and of course, badges, emoticons and backgrounds!) Some of the planned improvements are: - Steam Leaderboards - Steam Cloud Saving So, sit back, relax, and get into the wonders of That's Mahjong!",
