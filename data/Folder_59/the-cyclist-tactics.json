    "About the game": "The Cyclist: Tactics is a compelling, turn-based pro-cycling simulation with highly-customisable, user-friendly rider and team management. Manage your riders' races and career progression, build your team’s prestige and ride to victory in an infinitely-replayable board game representation of professional cycling. The Race - Your Decisions Matter The Cyclist: Tactics breaks with traditional sports management games, in that the racing itself is the focus of the gameplay, rather than a distraction. Guide your team through multi-day tours, gruelling classics and blisteringly fast time trials, while contending with challenging terrain. Use your team’s strengths to your advantage, and plan your strategy to offset their weaknesses. Realistic tactics are vital; use positioning within the field and slipstreaming to ensure your riders are in position to press your advantage when the time is right. Balance your riders’ resource use between keeping up with the field, versus making the big push for the win, while ensuring they aren’t exhausted for the next day’s stage! Career Mode - From Humble Beginnings, To The Top Start your rider in the amateur cycling circuit, building a team from local riders, and attracting a sponsor. Build your team’s prestige with good results and attract more attention both from prospective riders as well as more lucrative sponsors. Hire and fire your riders, scout new talent and develop them with an innovative RPG-style progression system into the superstars that will propel your team to the top of the professional cycling world. The Game World - Your Secret Teammate From punishing climbs in the mountain passes of Hetvesia, winding through the challenging cobblestone streets of northern Gasmea, to brutally hot time trials in the deserts of Dalluha, the unique and varied game world of The Cyclist: Tactics gains a life of its own, becoming a friend - or an enemy - during your journey to the top of the professional cycling tour. The Cyclist: Tactics uses intelligent procedural generation to create the stages upon which you race, allowing for nearly infinite and meaningful variation in landscape and terrain. Use the flat smooth roads in a given stage to conserve your resources, or mount your charge over the rough cobbles while your opponents are forced to back off - playing your strengths off the game world is vital to success!",
