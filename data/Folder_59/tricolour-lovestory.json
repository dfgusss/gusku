And because of this, she wasn’t the most popular one among her classmates.   But in the professor’s point of view, Violet was an absolute wizard of brushes. She worked her magic on a canvas like no one ever seen before. But her art was quite distinguished from her personality and seemed missing something crucial. What would that be?

And though she was the younger one, she insisted on acting more mature. And when he was locked up by his parents, he could always count on her.  But for some reasons, she is on 「NOT TALKING」 term with him.     ◆SYSTEM◆          ●Your decisions will guide the game to come!  The game carried the original, unprecedented system which basically uploads your every choice to our cloud sever, and shows the result to all after data was gathered and calculated on our page.
