    "About the game": "Unsung Story is a spiritual successor to Final Fantasy Tactics with many exciting innovations. The game takes place in Lasfaria, a world with musical magic where the ancient founders created a powerful song called The Opus to store the rules of history, science, and nature. But now, a 77-Year War has damaged that song and reality is coming apart. Players will need to build a team of Unsung Heroes who will start at the the final battle and work their way back in time to save the world. Game features Explore the magical world of Lasfaria with unique new races, distinctive locations, and years of lore. Play 6 chapters in non-linear order alongside iconic story characters on both sides of a 77-year War. Engage in 45+ diverse levels where none of them look or play the same way. Cast spells through songs and musical abilities. Coordinate your units to gain special bonuses with “Harmony Songbook” game play. Listen to an all-new, musical score by world renown composer Hitoshi Sakimoto . Customize your Unsung Heroes from 20 jobs and 150+ unique abilities. Stylize their look from options such as race, face, hair, and job outfit colors. Collect new options in side quests as the game progresses.",
