Their letters and notes reveal to you the events of the past few years. When you finally enter the centuries-old vaults beneath the house, you realize that a force beyond any imagination lurks here and your life is in mortal danger. Features Story inspired by real events from the World War I era. Authentic art-nouveau environment. Sophisticated puzzles with a variety of approaches.
