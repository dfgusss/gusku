    "About the game": "A remote complex, an ominous beam of light, and a system gone berzerk. Only the maintenance android Jewel can stop the control system draining the life from her planet! Voltage Drop is a single-screen puzzle platform game where the goal is simple: turn on all the switches and reach the exit. Sounds simple, but there are many obstacles in your path, and you'll need to use every trick you can think of to get past the lasers, locking gates, and out-of-control robots standing between you and the central computer! Features: 50 stages of brain-busting puzzle action. 16-bit style retro pixel graphics. Original FM synth chiptune soundtrack. Purple hair!",
