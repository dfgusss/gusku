    "About the game": "Evil threatens to overtake the planet, when you are betrayed by your friends who want to invoke the manifestation of the Dark One. Our hero, Scrall, is cavalier enough to try to stop them, even if underpowered. A seemingly unknown ally gives Scrall a source of strength, and he is able to stop the Dark Lord's coming. For now.... A classic dark divine comedy and epic odyssey recount, this Gothic RPG sports a visceral, modern convolution, and a masterful soundtrack. A cinematic experience, a la film noir, will see our hero journey across a custom-built and detailed landscape in his quest to quell the Dark One's minions, fighting the full gamut of the children of the night. Enjoy appropriately haunting, yet memorable musical themes, composed by a slew of underground greats, while undertaking unique puzzles and macabre, mysterious quests. Fully-expressed emotions across all major and minor character interactions, carefully plotted map detail, and alternate dialogue depending on who is the party leader will compel you to search for variant outcomes and nuances. The diligent explorer will be rewarded, as there is a plethora of secret passageways and treasure. The variety of hidden and bonus content should keep you playing for 40-100 hours (once the title leaves Beta form). You will get wet playing this game, possibly soaked, in your own blood, sweat, and tears. You've been warned.... Experience the light &amp; dark sides of Volvalis tonight!",
