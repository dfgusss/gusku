    "About the game": "Waves is a twin-stick shooter that can be played by anyone, but with a high enough skill threshold to keep even the most hardened shooter fan entertained. Set in a Neo-Cyberspace arena your system is being overrun by bugs, errors, and viruses. The only solution is to kill every rogue process before it kills you! Clear the arena of enemies while racking up a big fat Combo with swift kills and well-timed Bombs. If it all gets a bit too much you can use your Time Buffer to slow down the action and turn defeat into victory. Players can compete across seven different game modes with online high-score tables and Achievements in their pursuit of twin-stick perfection.",
