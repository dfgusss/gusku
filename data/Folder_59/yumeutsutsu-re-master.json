    "About the game": "'Save your sister' Country girl Ai Otori joins the game company where her sister works. There her story of love, mystery, and game-making begins. Yumeutsutsu Re:Master is a girls-love adventure game set in a small japanese game studio. The story is set in the town of Koenji, not far from the imperial capital of Tokyo, where a small game studio called Eureka Soft has set up shop. The heroine Ai, a country girl, joins her sister Kokoro who works there, after receiving a mysterious email from studio head. There she meets the quirky all-girl (and a dog) cast: the big sisterly head of the studio, her sister, giving her a cold shoulder, the maid/voice talent, the 'tiny dinosaur' scenarist, the uniformed artist, and Banako, the dog and vice-president. Ai starts learning about game making as she slowly pieces together the mysteries of her colleagues. Ai's world will expand bit by bit, as the game production begins.
