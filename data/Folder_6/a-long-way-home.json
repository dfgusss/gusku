    "About the game": "On day 200 of a 365 day mission your ship suffers a catastrophic engine meltdown. Stranded in space one hundred light years from Earth, you must make your way back one light year at a time. It's going to be a long way home. Jumping from asteroid to asteroid collecting enough dark matter to open the next portal is hard enough, even the tiniest miscalculation can end in death. When you start encountering explosive rocks, micro-comets and teleporting dark matter, things take a turn for the worse. Mobile History Yes, this game started out on the iPad. The original game was a 1024x768 touch only game. In preparing for it's move to Steam the entire game was redesigned. Every piece of artwork was recreated at a higher resolution, the game was converted to widescreen, sound effects were re-recorded and the entire menu system was overhauled. This is not a port.
