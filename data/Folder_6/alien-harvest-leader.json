    "About the game": "The Martian Queen has chosen you as the new Harvest Leader! As Harvest Leader you'll be aided by your helpful assistant, Greyg. Build and defend your base using your flying saucer to gather resources. Utilize your workers, research new technology, and rare equipment to improve your capabilities and keep your base stocked with treasures. Gather resources from specimen in the Earth-like harvest zone. The harvest zone changes depending on how you harvest. If you harvest ruthlessly, alerting specimen to your presence, then only the juiciest of specimen will be caught outside after dark. Infiltrate, however, and there'll be plenty of specimen, though they'll tend to be standard value. Either way, you’ll want to develop new technologies such as such as ship mounted turrets and super speed to handle specimen and their overzealous defenses: Black Helicopters, Five Z Towers, and Anti-Aircraft guns! It’s not all pyramids and shadows on Mars either: the rampant wildlife on the Martian surface will want your Harvest Material. They're practically digging through the ground to get it. The more your base is worth, the more wildlife and nefarious beasts will be shuffling in to attack. You'll have cannons, rocket launchers, and plasma throwers, all upgradable for your herd fighting needs. Keep your workers running your operations, or send them into the ancient mines beneath our base where they can fend for themselves and potentially bring riches back to you. Features Procedural Harvest Zone – A new, procedurally generated Earth like harvest zone each time you harvest! Loot Specimen – You don't just pick up specimen, you get what's in their pockets too! Get rare engine parts to power your ship, collectables, or even some useless junk that you can give to your workers or sell to the market back home on mars. Worker Management – Train your workers to do their best wherever you assign them. Feed them bread, give them junk to keep them happy, or send them in to the mines, or convert them to Harvest Material instead! Can’t have worker complaints if there’s no workers! Upgradable Turrets – Increase the range, rate of fire, and damage of your turret. Add a trained worker to the turret to really get things going.",
