    "About the game": "Alucinod is a first-person puzzle game where gravity changes to match the ground beneath your feet. There are no walls, there is no up, it all depends on where you stand. As gravity shifts, paths change and rooms loop and twist. Every surface could be a path forward, and puzzles become dense with possibility. Get lost in a seamless world, where each area flows into next with no breaks or cuts, nothing to disconnect your experience. An exploration of tone and atmosphere, a wordless story told through experience.",
