    "About the game": "/ / Save our four-legged friends! Your main goal in Animal Shelter will be to look after, treat, and give shelter to those under your care. You will have plenty of work to do with the shelter, which will become a refuge for any creature in need and will certainly help in finding suitable future owners. Keep in mind that the future owner-pet duo must complement each other. Your main goal? Finding a suitable home for your pets! Take pictures Who doesn't love taking pictures of their pets? We provide you with your own photo room, where you can create extraordinary photo sessions. Be creative, play around, and finally use the photos as decorations for the shelter. This will surely attract the attention of new visitors! Take care of your pets' well-being The adoption process is very lengthy and can give your pets a hard time. Remember to monitor their needs: from hunger and health to willingness to play and love. Special name cards will certainly come in useful. Their job will be to indicate the current needs of your little ones. Play with them Remember! An entertained pet is a happy pet! Your pets will spend most of their stay at the facility in comfy boxes, which is why you have to take care of the right amount of daily entertainment and exercise to keep them strong, healthy, and relaxed. Pet them, hand out treats, play with balls or lasers, and they will surely repay you with great trust and a happy muzzle! Everything in the right place A shelter is not only boxes: it is also a whole lot of other buildings. We give you the construction mode: manage, buy new buildings, rearrange the existing ones, expand the area - you are in charge! Remember that everything matters, and the spacing of outlets is no exception. Make your decision with caution. In the end, you will be the one moving around the shelter with your pets. Cool features? In Animal Shelter, we bet on innovation. You will not find our solutions in any other shelter. One example is the complete absence of noisy delivery trucks, which will be replaced with fast and quiet drones. Isn't that cool? It will definitely minimize stress in the animals that are not very fond of noise, and this is just one idea! Our game features so much more!",
