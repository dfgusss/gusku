    "Release date": "Aug 1, 2017",
    "About the game": "Multiplayer deathmatch games with drones! Enjoy fast multiplayer action with your drone in Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch competitions in exotic arenas. Arena is a game from the creators of Drone Fighters. Although it’s a very different kind of game, your avatars and drones will be synced across both games if you play them. Just like Drone Fighters, Arena is also supporting cross platform play between non-VR PC, Vive and Oculus players. There are 2 types of competitions in this Early Access version, Deathmatch and Team Deathmatch. We will be adding new modes with upcoming patches. Game controls are tuned to the platform, and we’ve tried to make it fun whatever your device of choice to play Arena. As in all Surreal powered games, you can customize your drone and avatar in great detail, and use the same configuration for all our other games. Join the community and share your thoughts and feedback. We want you to be part of the development process.",
