Player should destroy the enemy’s armed forces, capture territories, earn money and upgrade their army. In addition to the main types of units and weapons, player can use unique ordnance, such as radar reconnaissance, volley fire, air strikes, artillery strikes and many others. Also player has to do economic planning and resource management properly in order to win. So besides variety of weapons available, the game is not only about military skills. An arms race and the struggle for a control over factories require some economic planning. The in-game currency and proper resource management will help players to surpass their enemies. It is worth noting that there are no limits on the number of troops under player's command. If you ever played a well-known game 'Minesweeper' you will definitely enjoy a new improved ammunition of Artillerists that will let you know how far the enemy vehicles are from you. It makes the game truly tactical and exciting. It also trains your memory very well!
