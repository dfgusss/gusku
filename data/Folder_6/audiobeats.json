Players have to hit all the notes accurately! Core Gameplay The flying orbs indicate rhythm of the music. When an orb touches the hexagon fields, knock the panels to crash the note! There are three types of note: single, long key, and direction key. There are three levels of difficulty for each song: Easy, Normal, and Hard. Don’t forget good rhythm and accurate timing will get you a higher score! Features To allow players to better judge and hit the flying notes, we make sure that the hit determination point and note hitting panels are friendly for all players.
