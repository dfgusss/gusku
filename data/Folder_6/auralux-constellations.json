    "About the game": "Auralux: Constellations is the awaited sequel to Auralux, the critically acclaimed minimalistic Real Time Strategy game. Start with a single planet. Then, upgrade, expand, and attack until you’ve conquered the entire system. Now with Auralux: Constellations, for the first time you can play against your friends in local or online multiplayer games. Featuring gameplay constellations with one new feature at a time, Auralux: Constellations is a real-­time strategy game that distills the RTS genre to its essential elements. Explore new gameplay possibilities: what happens if you take these basic rules and add fog-­of-­war? What if the planets moved? What if you had wormholes connecting distant parts of the map? You can replay the game to near ­infinity. All this with a slow, graceful feel and vibrant minimalistic graphics, all pulsing to the rhythm of ambient music. This game is designed to provide a relaxing, cerebral experience. Every choice matters, and the only path to victory is through clever strategy. It’s Real-­Time Strategy, deconstructed. Main Features: Minimalist but challenging RTS gameplay Multiplayer, both local and online Each constellation has its own specific gameplay variation Gameplay­ driven music pulses and beats to the battle",
