    "About the game": "Before you start, remember to break the barrier of prejudice because there will be no low-res spaceships in this game! Beekyr Reloaded is an hardcore bee'em up game (shoot'em up with bees). The game breaks molds, moving away from the typical STG game, avoiding the space theme mixing vertical and horizontal scrolling stages with fun game mechanics. Each stage is very different from the previous: one level we could be fighting poisonous scorpions, another defending the hive collecting pollen, dodging bee-eaters, raiding dark caves protected by the most evil of wasps: Hornets. Features Mold-breaking theme: Based in the treacherous world of insects. 'Shmup first-play' friendly gameplay: Novice mode and 'Generic Shoot’em up/STG Tutorial' to enable new players understand and enjoy all shmup games. Horizontal and Vertical stages with very different game formats! 17 cool bosses to fight Tons of secrets: multiple playable characters, multiple endings, unlockable stages / worlds, retro visual effects. Real co-op multiplayer mode Enormous re-playability: 4 different stage combinations that might offer from 18 to 29 stages. Depending on game events / difficulty mode Global rank system, achievements Natural hazards in each level (storms, waterfalls, wind, rocks, darkness...) Powerups system. Innovatives 'Bee-squad' bomb and 'Bee-swarm' flock attack! Precise analog or digital controls: Steam and Xbox 360 controller support Game Crossovers Over 20 visual screen effects: Retro Arcade visuals, CRT monochrome, old cinema, sepia, vintage cameras, pixelated, trippin' and many more. Amazing soundtrack Game Modes Novice: (19 Stages) Learn how to play a shoot'em up game (a.k.a shmup) and get ready for the real action. Arcade: (25 Stages) Play the game at its original difficulty designed to have you playing for hours to reach a total completed game.
