    "About the game": "Sometimes to beat the monsters, you have to be the monster. Inspired by classic shooters and modern rogue-likes and -lites, Berserk Mode is an intense run-based shooter with a focus on transformations and high-speed mayhem. As the Berserker, you must race through deadly fiend-filled zones while your life force drains away. Slaughtering foes restores your health, and builds your rage to the point that you can transform into mythical beasts - and beyond. Receive curses in exchange for golden rewards, which you can spend on vicious weapons, powerful enchantments and exotic artifacts. Use every advantage at your disposal in this nightmarish challenge that will push your skills - and your humanity, to the very edge. GO BERSERK Race against the clock and bring sudden death to hordes of twisted fiends. BECOME A MONSTER When your bloodlust hits maxes out, transform into legendary beasts to tear your foes apart. GET STRONGER Precious experience expands body and mind. Customise your kit with exotic loadout equipment and Artifacts. GET IN THE ZONE Lose yourself in an ever-changing ode to slaughter. Enter Berserk Mode. Game Features - Time-attack shooter rogue-lite gameplay, full runs take around 30 mins - Unique beast transformation mechanic with customisable beast weapons - Risk deadly curses and alternate zones in exchange for mountains of gold - 20+ devastating weapons - 3 playable classes: Berserker, Brigand and Stalwart - 5 Unlockable 'Descension' Difficulty Settings - Procedurally generated levels - Hand-drawn pixel graphic violence - Original soundtrack by Cletus Lupus Berserk Mode is inspired by old school shooters from the Duke/Doom era, and modern rogue-like and rogue-lite games that focus on contained play sessions and fun/OP run synergies. Berserk Mode is intended to be a game you can pick up and bash for half an hour to let off some steam, but with enough depth and variety to keep you coming back for more. on the rogue-lite spectrum, I would say it's lighter on meta-progression and more heavily rewards skill and knowledge of the game. Please enjoy your time in Berserk Mode!! Cheers! Adam (Berserk Mode Dev)",
