Finn , the bodybuilder, former Marine, former grill man and former television technician; Becca , the deadliest and toughest girl on the planet; Teddy , the armored dog (that's what you read), who suffered experiments in this alien lab and now wants revenge, or just find its owner. Jack , another experiment in the alien laboratory, but this time with vegetables. Classic 2D platformer mechanics; 8-bits graphics and sounds; 4 playable characters; 4 weapon types for you to pierce the enemies; Blow up the enemies with your frag grenade; 7 stages with 3 levels each; Epic Boss Fights! Count on the help of power-ups, grenades and companions. But don't forget: you are the one man's army! HURRAH!",
