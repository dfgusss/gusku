    "About the game": "Captain, the Blobkins need your help! Monstrous, mutated fish are swarming from all over and eating your friends. Take command of your Blobkin; the mightiest, tiniest, defenders of the reef. Fight for survival, clean up the ocean and destroy the defiled monsters of the deep. Your Blobkin friends are ready to jump into the mayhem and be blasted at their enemies head-on. Squishy fists deal terrifying blows! Just one thing, Blobkin are your ammo, being launched from your blaster at your foes. But they are also your builders, and your health, so protect them at all costs. Because without them, those monsters might want to eat you next! BlobkinBlaster will launch with five unique variants of Blobkin that you can collect: Blasty Blue, Explosive Red, Purple Lighting, Sickie Greenie, and Yellow Zapper. Recycle the garbage around you into materials for powerful new weapons! With quick planning, you and the Blobkin can build Cannons, Decoy Blobkins and so much more. But be careful, the monsters will target your buildings too! The oceans are not a safe place Captain. Blobkin Blaster will ship with 12+ enemies and 3 major bosses. You'll have to swap between your Blobkin to quickly take down these brutes; you may even need to use more than one! Bosses will be big and mean, covering a large portion of your VR screen to really giving you that sinking feeling. Join us on Discord",
