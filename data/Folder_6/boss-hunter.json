    "About the game": "Let's cut to the chase! What's the most exciting part of any third-person, action/adventure, hack-and-slash game? That's right folks. You guessed it. It's the boss battles. Join our Boss Hunter friend as he fights 6 unique and challenging bosses in this boss battle game. Yes....this game is only 6 boss fights. But don't let it fool you....these bosses are not leaving without a good fight. Each of the 6 Bosses have their own unique fighting arenas, and you have to use your hatchet-wielding and slashing skills, as well as shooting skills to defeat each of these skilled fighters. You can use your gaming reflexes to skillfully dodge the attacks from these enemies. Be careful because each of these bosses have different styles of fighting, so you won't know what to expect when you encounter these evil contenders for the first time. Happy hunting folks....:)",
