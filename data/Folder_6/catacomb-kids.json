    "About the game": "The Origin Of Dungeons 500 Years ago the demon sorceress Abys was sealed away beneath her fortress by four legendary heroes and a fifth forgotten one. Over time, no longer held aloft by Abys' magic, the fortress sank into the earth and became a haven for foul creatures, dark magic, and the refuse of the Overworld. The fortress, now buried deep undergound, became known as The Catacombs, and kids from all over found themselves drawn into its shadows - seeking riches, power, knowledge, and escape. Now, coming-of-age ceremonies and criminal sentences alike all revolve around plumbing the depths of The Catacombs, and the legend of Abys has been all but forgotten. Some say she yet sleeps in the dark below, the seals that keep her contained growing ever-weaker. What Lies Beneath Catacomb Kids is a procedurally generated platformer, with an equal emphasis on quick reactions, tactical engagement, and strategic character growth. Wield swords, spears, axes, and daggers -- unleash powerful magicks to burn, freeze and poison foes with -- overcome traps and beasts both deadly and unrelenting. The game is streamlined but not 'simple', featuring a system where basic elements interact to create complex outcomes and stories. Lure monsters into combat with one another or take advantage of environmental hazards to trick your foes into their own bloody demise. The world is your crafting space, allowing you to create new items and tools from within the game-space itself, never needing to farm materials or navigate a menu to demonstrate your cleverness.",
