    "About the game": "Hell is other circles. The world is a pretty messed up place isn't it? Wouldn't it be fantastic if you could simplify your existence, reduce your dimensions as it were, and see life from a new perspective? Unfortunately, you are not alone in this new world. So if you're destined to spend time in your own circly hell, then why not try to clean it up while you're there? Non-stop shooter action! No, literally...it goes on forever! The end only comes when you either die or stop playing... in other words a perfect simulation of real life! A leaderboard so you can brag about how much mental anguish you can take to your friends! About the game I hope someone, somewhere finds enjoyment from my very first foray into games development. Circles of Hell started out as a dare to create a game using only a single art asset and after a week's development time and approximately 54 liters of energy drink, here we are. It wasn't exactly a labor of love but it is laboriously fun to play. Thanks for taking a look!",
