    "About the game": "Your cloning device doesn't start at all? No worries! With the help of a teapot we nudge the anvil from the shelf, it hits the fridge, the door opens, a egg rolls out, drops into to pan, it tilts and hits the rocket's launch button which takes off and hits the cloning device and it's done! Heureka! The brilliant chain reaction is completed! Thereupon the machine is starting to clone like crazy and finally it spits out one tasty sandwich after another. Sounds exiting? That was nothing!
