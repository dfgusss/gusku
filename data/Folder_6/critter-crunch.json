    "About the game": "Critter Crunch is an award winning, arcade-style puzzle game, starring the loveable Biggs. Using his long, sticky tongue to grab critters from vines above, he feeds them to each other until they burst, dropping tasty jewels for him to gobble up. Using Critter Crunch's 'Food Chain' mechanic, players will eat their way through a smorgasbord of levels and gorge on a feast of modes, including Co-op and Versus multiplayer. Oh, and barf. Rainbow barf! Key Features: Stunning Visuals: Hand-animated characters and backgrounds come to life in gorgeous 1080p at 60fps. 4 Single-Player modes: Adventure, Puzzle, Challenge and Survival offer something for everyone! 2 Multiplayer Modes: Team up with a friend in Co-op or battle each other in Versus. Both modes are playable online or locally. Addictive puzzle fun: With the unique Food Chain mechanic, players feed smaller critters to larger ones to make them pop! The longer the chain, the larger the reward! Tons of variety: Power Ups and Special Critters keep things fresh and offer new challenges.",
