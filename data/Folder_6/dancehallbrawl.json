    "About the game": "Our Story starts with Veta about to enter the city she left 10 years ago. She used to live there, but has finally returned in hopes of moving on from her past and improving the future. However, when she arrives, she quickly finds out that a lot has changed in the last decade. The home she used to know has been split into many different cities; she wants to bring everyone back together peacefully, but not everyone agrees with that idea. Veta is no pushover though, she's a 'dragon', and though she has the power to tear her way through, she chooses to reach people's hearts instead. In order to bring each city back together, she'll have to take alot of hits without dishing any out! -Includes all Beta versions of DANCEHALLBRAWL -12 Levels -3 Gamemodes DANCEHALLBRAWL features many different gameplay styles depending on which city you visit, from ARPG to Platforming, each city has many different styles of play. Free and frequent updates add more places to explore, new levels, more upgrades, playable characters, gameplay styles, and much more! Additionally, the community will be able to control where the game goes in each update, whether its improving old content or add new content, my goal is to include the community so much that it feels like this is OUR game, not just mine. This is my first indie game, and I want it to become something great that lasts the test of time, and am dedicated to communicating with anyone who buys it so I can improve stuff and hopefully get you excited for more! Enjoy! -PSY-KYO DYSFI",
