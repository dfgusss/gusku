    "About the game": "The Style Remember when games were simpler? When your concern wasn't how much health you had, but how many lives you had left? When you teetered on the edge of frustration and determination until at last you tasted sweet success? That feeling is what Data Ball attempts to capture and bring into modern gaming. Reminiscent of games like Marble Blaster combined with the obstacle-based level progression of games like Donkey Kong Country this roller-ball 3D-platformer will have you pushing yourself to do better and go farther. The Setting In a distant corner of the universe exists an ancient supercomputer plagued by malfunctioning circuits and corrupted data. Take control of one of its spherical maintenance drones and command a range of abilities as you progress through ever-more challenging levels. Current Features Challenging and Strategic Gameplay Using a myriad of traversal abilities (rolling, jumping, magnetism, etc) you must navigate through levels filled with a variety of obstacles and enemies. By strategically managing your charge level and looking ahead to plan your path you must overcome these obstacles in order to progress further. Your score will be rewarded by taking risks and completing levels quickly, but be careful not to lose all of your lives or you will be forced to start over. Multiple Game Modes Ascension (Solo and Multiplayer): Proceed through an endless series of procedurally generated levels and attempt to get as far as possible. Challenge yourself to earn a higher score by taking more risks and completing levels more quickly. Creative (Solo and Multiplayer): Build levels to challenge yourself and your friends. Race (Multiplayer): Challenge your friends or complete strangers in a race to the finish. Use all your abilities to defeat your opponent. Battle (Multiplayer): Battle others in an arena-style fight to death. Use all of your abilities as well as power ups placed in the arena to knock your opponents to their demise without getting knocked yourself. Multiplayer Flexibility Play with Friends Find others to play with Local/Split-screen and Online Multiplayer And More... Power Ups Leaderboards Cloud Saves Planned Features The following list of features are all planned to be in the final release of the game. While I cannot guarantee that everything on this list will make it into the game I can guarantee that a solid effort will be made to do so.
