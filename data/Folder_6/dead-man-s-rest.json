    "About the game": "1879, Golder's Rock. On a clear, moonless night in high summer, the stifling heat coils around a small town in the heartland of the Arizona Territory. Not a single lick of a breeze whistles through the dark, dusty main road, as silent as death itself. After tracking down an old enemy for eight long years, lone bounty hunter Lee 'Blackjack' McCarthy has finally pinned down his target—his eyes set only on vengeance for a past he can't forget. But when the town mayor is ruthlessly murdered on that fateful, sweltering night, Lee's plan suddenly stops dead in its tracks.
