    "About the game": "Deity Empires is a 4X, turn-based strategy game with a powerful “just one more turn” feel! Enter an intricate fantasy world as one of many deities posed to become ruler of the world. On a backdrop of classic 2D graphics, choose from one of the many playable races, and compete with rival deities as you explore the world. Extract food, natural resources, and valuable minerals from the land, and increase your power as you defeat wild monster lairs and build cities to expand your empire. Defeat rival deity armies in tactical battles, increasing the skill of your units with every victory. Materialize your deity to become a unit with extraordinary powers to lead an army in battle. Or strategically transcend your deity into an etherealized form, casting magical spells throughout the world and in any battle, and growing in power as you research magical spells and increase your magic skills in your quest for world domination. HUGE VARIABILITY IN GAME PLAY: Choose your deity's starting abilities from over 30 deity abilities, and select your starting magic knowledge from 10 different schools of magic. Witness the potency of your deity's spells increase with its magic skill. Explore the world map with over 200 unique units, each with choosable attacks, spells, abilities, and in-depth stats and attributes. Harness more than 250 unique abilities acquirable by units, and over 300 unique spells and enchantments in 10 schools of magic. USER-FRIENDLY GAME INTERFACE: Random map generator allows full control over the size and type of the map, from full land maps, to one continent maps, to island hopping maps with hundreds of islands. Powerful AI strategy on the world map, and AI tactics on the battle map enhance game play. If you prefer not to manage some aspect of the game, such as controlling your units in battle, managing cities, or managing workers/resources, you may assign any or all tasks to AI control, so you can focus on aspects of the game you prefer. Or manage all aspects of your empire yourself for ultimate control! IN-DEPTH WORLD OF FANTASY AND MAGIC: Find and create powerful magic items for your units, such as weapons, armor, shields, helm, rings, amulet, and boots. Items increase unit attributes, and have special enchantments to further enhance unit abilities (such as Health Regeneration, Dragon Slaying, or Invisibility). Increase unit experience and level as you win battles. As units increase in level, you determine which new spells, attacks, abilities, stats or attributes they learn. Summon powerful magical units to join the ranks of your armies, such as Dragons, Lich Lords, Rock Behemoths, and Shadow Rift Spawns, and lay waste to entire armies of less powerful units. ENGAGING CITY MANAGEMENT: Over 160 unique buildings can be built in each city. Streamlined interface allows quickly choosing building priority queues, so you never get bogged down with micromanagement. Over 200 technologies to research, increasing various aspects of your empire. Hire mercenaries in your cities as they make themselves available based on various factors which you influence.",
