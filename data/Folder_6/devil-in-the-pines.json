    "About the game": "Devil in the Pines provides an undeniably nerve wracking experience as you accomplish one simple goal: find the key. As evil and fear works against you, you must steady your hand as much as possible, because when demons find you, a single missed shot is likely fatal. You wield nothing but a crossbow with 6 bolts, a flashlight, and campfires to protect you from the evil supernatural entities that will stalk, intimidate, and attack you without relent. One life, one pull of the trigger, and your daughter's life hangs in the balance. Terrifying, Adaptive AI Supernatural enemies like you haven't faced before. Super fast, unpredictable, and they improve their attack the longer you stay alive. White-Knuckle Climax Once you find the key to open the mine, prepare for an ending you won't soon forget as all hell literally breaks loose. Menacing Paranormal Encounters Never let your guard down. Demons are not the only thing to be afraid of. Immersive Hint System Try your best to not cover your eyes. Keep a lookout for different forms of direction to help you find your way. Vast, Open Level Be mindful of your compass and campfires as it’s easy to get lost in the forest. Be rewarded for venturing into the black—find supplies leftover from past unfortunate hikers. Dynamic Gameplay Each time you die, elements change to ensure no two games are the same.",
