    "About the game": "Build up a world piece-by-piece using the power of the god-like Fates, while keeping them happy enough to avoid world-shattering temper tantrums! Fate Tectonics is a world-building puzzle game featuring a handcrafted pixel art style and a 16-bit symphonic soundtrack. Carefully place terrain tiles, piecing together the world in a way that will appease a growing number of god-like beings called Fates. One wrong move could mean angering the Fates, resulting in a chain reaction of destruction and chaos. Unlock the powers of the Fates to build a stronger and increasingly beautiful world and face off with final Fates for the ultimate world-crumbling finale. Features Easy to pick up and play casually, but also offers deep challenge for more strategic players. Handcrafted in-game pixel art, a soundtrack of symphony &amp; steam by composer Robby Duguay, and Twitter-shareable worlds! The powerful Book of Fate keeps track of your progress and chronicles your adventures! Two game modes —test your world-building skills in timed cycles of creation and destruction under Ragnarosa and Fortuna's vigilant watch, or take your time and build up a world as large as you can at your own pace, under the calming influence of Serenity .

It was a long five minutes. Around an hour and a half, all told. (…) It’s rather good.”—ADAM SMITH, Rock Paper Shotgun “The combination of strategy and puzzle solving is certainly unique and makes for a very addictive gameplay experience.”—GAMERAMBLE “(The game) allows players to derive meaningful satisfaction from creating expansive worlds one piece at a time. It’s almost meditative during the early going. Then it starts to get a bit tricky.” - CHAD SAPIEHA, Post Arcade (Financial Post) “I personally found that it brought back a sort of childlike joy that came from building things with blocks or legos as a kid, then destroying it all in a cathartic burst of destructive control.”— ALEXX APLIN, Mod Vive. “My main piece of advice is be willing to fail. It has some of the best game over gameplay since Sim City of old.”—CHRISTOPHER DEMELO, The Snarge. “The strategic spin on a world-building game gives Fate Tectonics an added challenge many people won’t expect.” — CONOR BAILEY, The Spew. 'If you play only one real-time polytheistic tile-placement world-building strategy puzzle game , make it this one!'—RAIGAN BURNS Metanet Software (N++) 'Has all the joys of creating with all the pains of having it crumble away around you .'—JAMIE TUCKER, Asteroid Base (Lovers In A Dangerous Spacetime) 'Fate Tectonics is a beguiling game; it lures us in with the cathartic pleasure of clicking together puzzle pieces . The satisfaction in snapping the precise piece into the perfect place is matched only by games like Carcassonne. That is until you realize that you are actually playing a precarious game of house of cards with three angry toddlers stomping about.'—JOHN Z. LINDVAY BigSushi.FM Fate Tectonics is a proud GDC 2015 alumni of the Indie Megabooth.",
