    "About the game": "This is a slightly different history to the world we know. An anti-war visual novel parody set in 1930s Germany where you play Goeppels-chan, the Minister of Propaganda, and have to keep the Fuhrer happy. The A-Part is about going to Venus on a flying saucer repaired by the Nazis. The B-Part is about protecting Germany from a Martian invasion. In order to bring an unheard of volume of story, there are now less choices and the game has become more like a graphic novel. Direction/Writing Nao Minda Illustration Kiichi Voice actors Geli Goeppels/Gumi Kinoshita",
