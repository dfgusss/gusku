    "About the game": "Raise the dead, gnome style! Journey through the corrupted lands of Gnomandia defeating the hordes of evil that are spreading through the once-peaceful gnome villages. Resurrect gnomes to fight for you as you gain experience, level up your stats, increase your gnome army, find and upgrade epic procedural loot and advance through dozens of levels. Adventure alone or with up to 4 players in split and shared-screen coop twin stick shooter action. Inspired by a love of both Gauntlet and Pikmin, this game marries classic twin-stick shooter mechanics, real-time army management, incremental mechanics with a cheerful Mario Sunshine-style aesthetic.",
