    "About the game": "LoopWorlds is a game of difficult logic puzzles, with disco dance-floor graphics. After each stage of 8 levels, a new game mechanic will be added, including sliding ice blocks, button-activated walls, and portals. Press the arrow keys to move the disco ball in that direction, and it will keep moving until it hits something. Also if the disco ball leaves a screen edge, it will loop back in again on the opposite side, making for a very interesting brain challenge. It gets pretty epic! You can also create and save your own awesome levels and let your family try them out later.",
