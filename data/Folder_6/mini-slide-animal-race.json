    "About the game": "Play quick &amp; fun races with your friends. Ride cute turtles through dreamy environments and use unfair bonuses to outrun the horde! Master the dive to avoid obstacles and gain boosts, and explore to find hidden shortcuts. Or just take a tour and enjoy the view, while listening to the sympho-ethnic soundtrack. That's up to you. Play up to 4 friends (or enemies) in local split-screen. Multiplayer Play up to 4 players in local splitscreen! Steam 'Remote Play Together' is supported. The game is family friendly and offers some assistance for younger players or beginners. However, to fully master the game, you'll have to take advantage of all the controls the game offers. Easy to get, hard to master! Dive to Boost At any time you can choose to dive under the track; this makes you drift but you gain boosts afterwards. The trick is, diving can also be done in a straight line. Use it wisely to outrun your opponents! But will you be able to handle this super speed? Diving is also useful to avoid bad stuff on the track. Bonus Find bonuses along the way to boost, protect yourself, or clutter the way of other players... But be careful, every trap will stay there until the end of the race. So try not to punish yourself! It can quickly become a mess and the last lap is often full of surprises.",
