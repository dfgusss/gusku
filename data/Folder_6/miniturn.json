    "About the game": "Miniturn is a turn-based 1v1 multiplayer strategy game. It can be played competitively or just for fun on a casual basis. It is a card game that has its own twist. Your health is your money. You play on a small 16x16 grid map and after you played a card in the game you have control over the unit and you can direct their fate or lead them into battle. A match of Miniturn is usually won by one side when the enemy's Crystal has been destroyed. Due to a small player base, we can't guarantee that there is another player in the queue at all times, so we recommend joining our official MiniTurn Discord server to find someone to play with. (You can find a discord invite on our website and in-game) Good luck and have fun playing, Max Coppen and Christopher Freund",
