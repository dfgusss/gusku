    "About the game": "Mother Simulator is a game for the gaming platform Windows PC, in which you will take a role of a new mother. For coping with all difficulties which expect a young parent, you need steel nerves, fast reaction and, of course, your loving heart. Well, and those, who cope with all the tests, can expect the Grand Prize – the smile of your baby, a lovely, harmless and not evil baby. It’s a humorous project about a young parent's difficult weekdays. If you feel worried, irritated, you don’t understand what’s going on and what you must do next, so don’t worry. We want to give you exactly these feelings in our game. At each new level the passing conditions become more complicated. But because of it the victory is more pleasant and your place in the mum’s top table is higher. Mother Simulator is a first person game. At each stage a young mum must do everything necessary for her lovely baby, for example, feed, change the diaper or make a child sleep.",
