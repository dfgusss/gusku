What should I do in this game? ~ Collect coins and fan's admiration (hearts) ~ Green leaves give you energy to jump higher and longer. You can't jump if your energy is low. Each jump takes some of your energy, depending on the difficulty level. On EASY difficulty, you won't lack energy. But on the HARD difficulty you need to think of the most effective route to collect all the hearts and coins before you lose the energy. ~ Brown leaves make you lose 10 energy points if you touch it. But if you run at it or jump on top of it, you will jump higher. Use it when you can't reach a certain platform every other way. ~ Stay away from green goo, you will lose health points. ~ If the hero loses all his lives, the game goes to the beginning first level. ~ Monsters - grey, vicious creatures moving horizontally or vertically across the field. Meeting with them, the hero jumps away from it and loses energy. At the first levels, this amount is small, but later the monsters can take a lot. Try not to get caught on their way. Often this happens in flight after a jump. 3. How to start playing. ~ Use Left Mouse Button to choose options from the main menu ~ To start a new game, select Game Setup and game difficulty.
