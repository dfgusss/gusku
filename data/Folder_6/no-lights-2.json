Play with a security guard at a nightclub, every day you sleep in the afternoon and at night you go to work, as the nightclub is under maintenance you will work with it empty, so at night only you will be there watching. The very old place ended up needing some renovations so you will be responsible for keeping watch over the place. Check the hallways, watch the rooms and prepare for the worst. Also follow the security guard's house and several other places throughout the game, remembering that the security guard is not a fighter, just a flashlight and his own courage will keep him alive, and the danger is almost invisible in this game based on real events. ATTENTION: We received several reports by email, we don't know which one is really true, so we rely on the image system at the end of each Master Studios game.",
