    "About the game": "Step through the 4th Wall… …into the world of NUMINA . You get in contact with Shawn who is able to hear your voice through the 4th wall! You meet in a very critical moment where Shawn loses someone very close to him while being swept up in a conspiracy that involves your mutual bond. A plot threatening to shake the foundations of the world. Your bond will be tested in an exciting adventure that fuses many classic RPG aspects: A character-driven story in which your relationships change the course of the story, a dynamic battle system, challenging puzzles, towns waiting to be explored and other exciting locations! ✨ Play Numina Part 1 now!! ✨ Part 1 is ~24hrs of gameplay (about 2/3 of the full game). Part 2 is still being worked on and will conclude the story. Release is planned as paid DLC in Q4 2022. There's also a free demo of the 1st hour of the game from which you can transfer your saves to the full game. Key Features Breaking the 4th Wall The 4th wall is a concept from theater where the actors on stage directly interact with the audience. In the same fashion, you partake in the story of Numina as a character in the form of a bodiless voice that only Shawn can hear - a guardian spirit. You can interact with Shawn and influence his decisions through dialogue choices in the game. Branching Decisions The decisions you make influences the relationship Shawn has with the other characters you'll meet in the game. Having good relationships with your party members unlocks powerful combo-attacks in battle and may open up the opportunity to take your relationship to the next level ♥ Your decisions also influence the overall course of the story to conclude into one of the four possible endings. Battle with the Elements Engage in a round-based combat system with action inputs for some attacks that require you to make timed inputs for maximum damage! Each character also has unique elemental abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses. Incorporate this into your strategy to quickly win battles. Explore the World of Alterna Most side quests in NUMINA allow you to dive deeper into the backstory and lore of the world. But you can also explore the beautiful scenery with your grappling hook to reach higher places and find new gear, spell scrolls or rare items.",
