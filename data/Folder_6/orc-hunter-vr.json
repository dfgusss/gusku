    "About the game": "In the roomscale VR wavegame Orc Hunter you have to defend yourself against hordes of orcs. To do so you can either use swords in close combat or fight them with a bow or magic staff from a distance. Key Features: - Room scale VR To create a lifelike feeling, Orc Hunter uses the HTC Vives' roomtracking as the way to control the players movement. - Motion controlled weapons You use both of the vives' motioncontrollers to freely pick your weapons. Besides swords, you can currently choose a bow, a mace or a shield. Discord: If you are interested about the features we will add in the future, you should check the disussions. You can find them on the right side of the store page.",
