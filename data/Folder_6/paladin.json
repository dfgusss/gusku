    "About the game": "You are earth's last hero - defend civilization from annihilation. Protect the cities, destroy the aliens and upgrade your fighter. Drive back the vile invading scum and save mankind in this frantic twin-stick shooter! Gameplay You pilot a highly manoeuvrable space fighter across a 2d landscape, charged with saving the last remaining human cities from destruction. With its roots in retro, side scrolling classic arcade games like Defender, Paladin mixes old school gameplay with a modern 360 degree twin-stick control scheme and vibrant vector style glowing graphics. Each alien killed releases a cash bounty - collect these and upgrade your fighter's abilities at the end of each level. Replenish your shields? Go big on nukes? Max up your standard cannon? The choice is yours. Features 5 different game styles. 7 star fighters to pilot - choose your favourite. Kill aliens, earn cash and upgrade your craft. Blast your way through waves of asteroids, hunters, drones, spawners, grunts and many, many more. 4 evil end of level bosses to battle along the way. Multiple Achievements to chart your progress throughout the game. Are you hardcore, or just want to chill out? A selection of difficulty levels to match your mood.",
