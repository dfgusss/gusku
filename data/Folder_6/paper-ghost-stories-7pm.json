    "About the game": "7PM is the first, bite-sized instalment of an anthology horror series by Cellar Vault Games. Experience a day in the life of three children as they attempt to invite a mysterious new neighbor to play with them. What was supposed to be an offer of friendship quickly takes a dark turn as each of the children experience terrifying visitations. Not everyone or everything is as it seems in this apartment block, and dark secrets lurk everywhere if you can find them. Gameplay Spend the day experiencing life in the apartment block, moving between the different areas, talking to residents and completing tasks and minigame challenges. Slowly uncover hints, find items and encounter new people to talk to. You'll need to play through more than once to discover all the block's secrets. *Choices matter: Interact with different people to start conversations and learn the story through them. Choose wisely though; sometimes decisions need to be made which close off other paths. *Some tasks are more hands-on than others, and you need to do more than just talk.",
