    "About the game": "JOIN US ON DISCORD ABOUT THE GAME Paws &amp; Effect: My Dogs Are Human! is a quirky-comedy visual novel that is brimming with the kind of obsessive love that only pets inspire! Play as Sadie (name customizable), an aspiring lawyer whose life hurls headfirst into chaos when her two dogs (names also customizable) suddenly transform into people! Guide Sadie through this harrowing ordeal, but beware: Mysterious figures lurk in the shadows, monitoring your every decision! What will Sadie teach the dogs about being human? What will she learn about the realities of canine existence? And who is behind all of these shenanigans? Across a branching 3-5 hour romp, discover the answers to these questions, and maybe a few others that you had hoped to avoid... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Professionally drawn backgrounds and sprites! Cute music and animations! Hundreds of voice clips across seven major characters! Loads of expressions! Adult humor! Pop culture references! Choices that meaningfully affect in-game events! ~50,000 words spread across multiple paths and 5 distinct endings! A robust episode and choice select feature to enhance replays! In-game achievements (or 'treats')! Cute dogs that are based on real dogs! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Paws &amp; Effect features a small, but a colorful cast of characters, including but not limited to the following: An aspiring lawyer, Sadie (name customizable) is intelligent and caring, albeit with a sardonic impulse. She's unsure about her life's direction -- and doubly so when the whole thing goes off the rails. Beset by problems new and old, how will she keep it together? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sadie's good friend from college, Diya is just as ready to help out as she is to throw shade. With her sharp instincts, she knows something is up - and she won't let Sadie leave her in the dark about her new 'friends'. Whether she can handle the truth is another matter... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Sadie is still recovering from her break-up with Vincent, her skinny Australian boyfriend for the last year. Things seemed to be great until they discovered their diverging opinions about keeping pets, which prompted the separation, but old flames sometimes burn longest... assuming her dogs don't snuff it out. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- With a subdued demeanor and thoughtful gaze, Peaches (name customizable) is the more intellectual-seeming of Sadie's dog duo. Or maybe he just has the lax hubris of a creature that's been spoiled with treats and cuddles. He doesn't really care either way. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Intensely loyal and obviously needy, Pecan (name customizable) is a girl's best friend - as long as you stay out of her war path. Her obsessive love for Sadie is matched only by her distaste for Peaches, but her true fixation is the sky and all the evil it harbors. Y'know, birds, planes, space .",
