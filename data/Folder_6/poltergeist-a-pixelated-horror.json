    "About the game": "Have you ever wondered what it feels to be a ghostly being? You have always lived happily in your mansion. A mansion that you managed to obtain with a lot of hard work and many personal sacrifices. Naturally you don't want anyone else to take care of it, not even in death! But now, after your demise, many tenants have taken over it, and this is intolerable to you. Luckily, your love for your manor has granted you powers that will help you get rid of those pesky individuals. Watch them run and scream, scaring them using your intelligence, wit, and with the use of powers like possessions, spectres, altering objects and more. Have fun and play with the occult... and become a Poltergeist! Poltergeist: A Pixelated Horror is a puzzle game for PC/Mac/Linux, in which you are a ghost named Henry B. Knight. You will scare the tenants currently living in your house, so you can have some peace at last in the afterlife.",
