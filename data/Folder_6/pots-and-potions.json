    "About the game": "Pots &amp; Potions is a competitive local multiplayer mayhem about crafting the craziest, most impossible potions in an ever-changing alchemy lab where the environment itself conspires against you. Both the potions themselves, as well as the ingredients and pots you use will leave the laboratory in a complete mess and will make it very difficult for you to be the first. Alchemy has never been this crazy! (PLEASE take into account this it's our first game and it started as a Master's degree final project).",
