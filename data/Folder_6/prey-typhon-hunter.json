Mooncrash includes Prey: Typhon Hunter, an online multiplayer update.

Every object is a potential enemy. Will Morgan or the Mimics prevail? TranStar VR is a single player VR-only campaign included in the Typhon Hunter update. This campaign puts you in the shoes of various TranStar employees as you complete objectives and solve intricate puzzles on Talos I, just days before the events of Prey.
