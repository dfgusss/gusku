    "About the game": "Fast paced first person shooter game with bullet hellish gameplay and ability to change gravity. Key features Changing gravity Have you ever wanted to walk on ceiling? Well now you can! Bullet hell All the bullet are physics based (no hitscan) so you can dodge most of the bullets (with a bit of skill) Bullet time Just somewhat standard slowing down of time. Really helps with dodging bullets and also shooting down enemies while in air. Are you asking why would anyone do that - because it's cool! Melee Because sometimes you just want to punch someone in face with mace (or sword or axe). Dashing Skip short distance frontward. Help with platforming. Also good to get out of hard to handle fighting situations. Bossfights More enjoyable to fight with than your common foe.",
