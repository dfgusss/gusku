    "About the game": "NOTE: This is a student project created in an educational setting by senior Game Development students at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Team up with your friends or go solo to save the city of Jamford from sound-hungry monsters! Keep in touch with the news to find citizens in need of help. Attack on the beat for stronger hits, and hold to the next beat for a powerful charge attack. Choose between four characters, each with their own attack style and role in your team's music. Build new weapons to make new sounds and instruments for your character! Explore Jamford, a procedurally generated city with a different layout every time you play!",
