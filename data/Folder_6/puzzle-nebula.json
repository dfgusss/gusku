When you wake up, you find yourself in space, trapped inside a weird machine. How did you end up here? What is your purpose? Is any of this even real?' Features 80 challenging levels, each set in an unique procedurally generated star system. Lots of different platforms that make the puzzles increasingly complex. Intriguing sci-fi storyline that will make you question the very nature of our universe. Plays well with a controller or a keyboard.",
