After fixing the clock the player is transported to the past and has to solve puzzles in order to find the way back home. The game aims to teach and tell the history of Kajaani city hall through interactive gameplay. While exploring the site throughout the eras, the player can learn many interesting tidbits about the history and the different stages of the city hall. Players will learn how the city hall operated and how it used to look throughout its’ history. The game environment was modeled in co-operation with the Kainuu Museum and Finnish museum association and utilized old pictures, photogrammetry and documents to accurately match the 30’s and 60’s. The development of Raatihuone is part of Stories to games project which is coordinated by the Finnish Museum Association and funded by European Social Fund.",
