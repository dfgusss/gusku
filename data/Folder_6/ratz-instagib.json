    "About the game": "Fast, frantic and full of blasting fun – take to the rat-tlefield and join the Ratz Instagib revolution! Duke it out as a railgun-toting rat in household-themed arenas, with every shot being a potential kill – no shooting opponents repeatedly to little effect or suffering cheap deaths at the hands of people with an unfair advantage. It's every rat for themselves! One Gun, One Shot – An even playing field means almost anyone can immediately pick up Ratz and start having fun, no matter what their FPS skill level. Rocket Jumping – Use the dedicated 'Rocket Jump' button to mix up your movement; moving targets are harder to hit! Maps – Enjoy 13 different maps based on real-world household environments, plus tonnes of user-created arenas! Customisation – Unlock loads of customisation items to jazz up your Ratz, then choose from loads of beam and frag types to really show off your style. Modes – The best that FPS action has to offer: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture The Flag and the almighty Freeze Tag! Stats and Leaderboards – Fully integrated stat-tracking and leaderboards to help keep track of your progress… can you become the best rat around? RatzEd Map Editor – Create your own stages and share them with the community via Steam Workshop – easy to use, but incredibly versatile",
