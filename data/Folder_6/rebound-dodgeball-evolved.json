    "About the game": "Rebound Dodgeball Evolved is a fast, competitive, multiplayer Sci-fi themed dodgeball game. The top down camera and twin stick shooter controls makes it easy to just pick up and play however the fast-paced nature of the game gives it a high skill ceiling. Players can team up and play against each other both online and offline with any combination of maps, Mutators, and gamemodes. Mutators: Mutators greatly change up the rules of Rebound Dodgeball Evolved by changing the behaviour of the dodgeballs or through adding new abilities. Instead of dodgeballs slowing down over time, Nitro Ball speeds the ball up with each collision resulting in a hectic game that only gets more dangerous over time. Time Glitch throws a spanner in the works by sending everyone back in time to where they were shortly before, pay attention and you can save your past self from a dodgeball! Maps: With over 15 unique maps you must adapt quickly to take advantage of the new geometry and stage hazards to ensure the win. Watch out for portals! Multiplayer: Rebound Dodgeball Evolved can be played both locally and online with up to 4 players. Team up with your friends or play free-for-all to see who truly is the dodgeball champion. If you're playing alone or offline, challenge your skills against the bots and see if you really are the dodgeball champion! Playlists: Create a playlist with any combination of maps and Mutators for the ultimate customised experience or play one of the pre-made recommended themed playlists.",
