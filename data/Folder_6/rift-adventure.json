    "About the game": "Rift Adventure is a 2D platformer with action, adventure and RPG elements set in a vivid fantasy world. You are an adventurer that lives for treasure and excitement, but after seeing your friend and adventuring partner being captured by a great evil, you must also understand your place in your community, and how your actions affect those around you. Explore numerous stages, all crafted with pixel art graphics, and return to your city to rest, heal, interact with NPC citizens and buy items and resources with the money obtained in your adventures. Your community changes with every choice you make. Will you think in what's best for all, or will your choices benefit only you? In Rift Adventure, the player will learn to juggle their own wants and needs with that of those around them, as well as understand the importance of being a good member of their community in a natural, organic way. Engage with the game's well-developed mechanics of taxation and economic stability and growth, and see your city thrive - or suffer - in the face of your decisions. Explore the world through the eyes of Aksius, a sword-wielding bunny, and later unlock Krinis, his gun-toting cat partner, to adventure through the game's many levels. Manage your inventory and resources, and choose your strategy carefully in the face of the many dangers you'll encounter.",
