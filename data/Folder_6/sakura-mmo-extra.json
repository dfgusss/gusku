    "About the game": "Sakura MMO Extra is a sequel to Sakura MMO #3, which takes place after the harem ending. Several months have passed since Viola and her ragtag party saved the realm of Asaph from impending destruction. Now left with little else to do, Viola whiles away her time accepting quests from the guild in Lynton, but none of them pose a challenge. Viola's life in Asaph might be perfect, what with her harem of cute girls to dote on her, but it's also perfectly boring. Dissatisfied with a lack of strong enemies to fight, Viola turns her attention to a business proposal brokered by Lynton's guild mistress, Maidie. Maidie plans to start up a maid café in Lynton, and she wants Viola, Neve, Fion, and Eleri to lend her a helping hand! Viola agrees to her offer, despite Neve's nay-saying, and a brand new chapter of Viola's life in Asaph begins. Join Viola as she works as a maid, choose which member of her harem to dote upon, and watch her embark upon a brand new adventure. Viola is the heroine of the Sakura MMO series. Her real name is Kotone, and she was born in Japan, but strange circumstances brought her to Asaph. She's known throughout Asaph as the dark witch, and she has immense powers. She's so infamous, she has to disguise herself while going out in public, for fear of causing unrest. She's something of a sadist, and there's nothing she loves more than tormenting cute girls. Neve is Viola's loyal maid. She adores her mistress, and would do anything for her - even morally dubious things. Though Neve appears polite and mild-mannered, she has quite the fiery temper. She's fiercely protective of Viola, and she will not hesitate to harm anybody who dares make fun of her lady. Fion is a cheerful, energetic girl who spent many years living on the streets. As an ex-thief, she's quick with her fingers, and she's incredibly devious. Fion is very fond of Viola, who helped reunite her with her older sister, Holly. Affectionate as a cat, there's nothing she loves more than cuddling up with her mistress. Eleri is a stoic, socially-awkward woman who hails from Japan, much like Viola. She, too, was summoned to Asaph, and ever since has worked hard honing her swordsmanship. She fancies herself as a knight, and she takes her duties very seriously. She often trains herself to the point of exhaustion, much to Viola's concern. Though duty-driven, she is extremely self-conscious, and she's prone to being embarrassed. She needs a good deal of love and support, which Viola is only too happy to provide. Maidie is the guild mistress at Lynton. Cheery and irreverent, she's an incorrigible lover of gossip. She's often thinking up get rich quick schemes, and has a particular interest in maids. It is Maidie's newest business venture into the realm of maid café's which sets this additional chapter of the Sakura MMO series into motion, and sees the girls decked out in frilly dresses.",
