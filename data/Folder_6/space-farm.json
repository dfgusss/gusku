    "About the game": "Space Farm is a space-themed farming RPG! You are a farmer on earth, a bright light shines on your barn. Concerned for your livestock you chase the light. Running after it, you get sucked into a tractor beam and forced to survive on a foreign planet. You must farm, collect, fish, and upgrade your way to finding the secret to your escape. You will meet friends, foes, and stories along the way. Can you solve the mystery of... Space Farm? Features We have done a few things to try to make our game stand out as a different game, but keep some of the core values we all love so much. A few things we have done in our game: Dynamic Marketplace - instead of throwing your stuff in a box and going to sleep, you can now sell live to one of the 4 planets that are near the planet you are on! We have done this to make it more exciting and also, to help you choose with Race you gain Reputation from. Reputation - While not a new idea, it is new in the realm of this genre. You need to sell items, do quests, and use some in-game mechanics to gain race reputation. What's it good for? It helps you unlock shops, and new map areas, among other things. Farming Tools - While we all love holding 14 tools in our bag slots (NOT). We have decided to create an all in one 'Farming' Gun! Use this to farm, collect, battle, and fish! Mind you, it may require a few parts... Crops - We have an absolutely GREAT time farming the same salad in every farming game since 1990.. But to switch things up we have also created a unique mix of Space Crops to grow and enjoy, just watch those side effects! (Also you can grow the same old salad.) Mind you, you gotta figure out how to use that darn 3D printer first.. Storyline - Instead of trying to compete with games in our genre that are built around building and unlocking items to infinity, we decided to add a secret sub plot around our game. So yes, there is an END! Enjoy our light-hearted humor to find the secret to Space Farm... Other notes: Created in BC, Canada One hour of original modern music It's our first game, we hope you enjoy",
