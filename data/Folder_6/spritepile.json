    "About the game": "Inspired by similar software and pixel art tools, SpritePile is an attempt at creating the very best tool to create... Sprite Stacks! It was developed for use with primarily 2D games. I created this software while developing my own game which uses sprite stacks and found myself disappointed with the tools available to me. This was designed to do everything I felt was missing from other programs... and to do it better.
