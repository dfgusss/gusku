    "About the game": "Star Trek™: Bridge Crew, playable in both VR and non-VR, will immerse you in the Star Trek universe. The game puts you and your friends in the heart of the U.S.S. Aegis. Your mission: explore a largely uncharted sector of space known as The Trench, in hopes of locating a suitable new home world for the decimated Vulcan populace. The Klingon Empire is also active in the region, and their purpose is a threat to the Federation’s plans. Make strategic decisions and coordinate actions with your crew to complete the mission. In co-op, you can form a crew of four players to serve in the roles of Captain, Helm, Tactical and Engineer. In addition to a dynamic storyline, the game features an “Ongoing Missions” mode, procedurally generating missions for countless hours of Solo and Co-op adventure. In Star Trek™: Bridge Crew, you’ll need more than just individual skill to overcome the challenges; communication, trust, and close crew coordination are the keys to victory. Uplay account and Uplay PC application required for game activation and installation. A permanent internet connection is required in order to play the game.",
