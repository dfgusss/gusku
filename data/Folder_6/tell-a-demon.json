    "Release date": "Jul 21, 2017",
    "About the game": "There was once an immortal Empress. Then it turned out she was not so immortal after all. She ruled the World of Aeser for over a thousand years until her own courtiers betrayed her. That was a hundred years before you were born. They always said the Empress cast a long Shadow, and today the Shadow of a dark empire hangs over your head. Face that lingering darkness from the perspective of three characters with intertwining stories. Julius You are Julius, a shadow demon. Your kind once served the empire as mindless automatons. But your mind and memories were returned to you by chance. Will you take this opportunity to get your mind back for good ? Or will you succumb to the Hunger that whispers to you? Kalevel You are Kalevel, an ancient demoness once despised by the immortal Empress. Now, long life has left you complacent. Will you see the signs of a new enemy before it is too late? Tell You are Tell , a girl who wants desperately to leave a home plagued by memories of family tragedy. Unfortunately, your hunt for job in the city brings you smack up against that tragedy in the least likely of places. Who would have thought you'd find a ghost from your past in the notorious Imperial catacombs? Some choices affect your character's personality. Others alter the plot. Some paths lead to horror. Others to romance or friendship. Endings unfold and are fully realized rather than being tersely summarized. With 80,000 words of content, each playthrough comprises 1-2 hours of gameplay, although this varies widely with each path. Tell a Demon is designed to be replayed , however, and to find and fully experience all the content takes 4-6 hours or more. The ghost of the Immortal Empress invites you to enter... ...the mysterious World of Aeser.",
