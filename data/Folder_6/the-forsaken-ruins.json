    "About the game": "Inspired by popular titles such as Amnesia: The Dark Decent, Alien: Isolation and Outlast – The Forsaken Ruins is a first-person atmospheric horror game. As prisoner of Ever-Bleed Keep, your chance to escape has come. Delve deep into the ruins and try to survive long enough to unravel its dark history and your true identity. Story “You are now no-one, left forsaken and accompanied only by the lies of your past life, scattered here. Seek out my red letters before claiming to understand your imprisonment… you may find my letters, but it would be wise not to lose yourself along the way.” Tormented by an unknown entity, the prisoner is set to endure years of pain. No matter if she were to die or neglect her wrongdoings, this mysterious entity would keep her bound until she was worth to be judged once more. That day… has finally come. Features Immersive Sound Multiple sound concepts are used such as obstruction, occlusion, and reverberation to simulate realistic environments. Level Design The Forsaken Ruins features multiple levels, including multi-story locations with appropriate planning towards AI movement and puzzles. Interactive Puzzles Solve Cursed Words and puzzles by interacting with the environment around you. Pick up objects and throw them to overcome challenging obstacles. Monsters Stay hidden or run away from monsters that otherwise dwell in dark corners of Ever-Bleed Keep. Horror &amp; Fear Visual and sound design help create points of interest that will immerse the player into a much shadier world. Narrative Collect notes to unravel the dark history of Ever-Bleed Keep. Find out your true identity by uncovering cryptic passages held in you journal. NOTE: The Forsaken Ruins is currently being developed as a university project, and so, will release as an Early Access title. I intend to keep working on the game even after university finishes upon release. As it stands, I have plans to refine the game-play and add more content in the future.",
