    "About the game": "The Quest for the BIG KEY is highly inspired by NES classics that you will no doubt recognize. It focuses more on the exploring part. It comes completely without Enemies and Battles. So if you like finding secret passages and collecting items that allow you to progress in different parts of the map, this game is for you. Just don't die! Features: Exploring Secret Rooms About 10 different Pickups More than 60 Rooms What it has NOT: Random Battles Enemies Fights Puzzles Checkpoints Save Games Long Gameplay A high price What it has: Coins Heart Containers Bombs Keys More Pickups Power Ups Gameplay: About an hour Speedrun: I did it in 20 Minutes (please share a video of your time) Since the game is really not that long, there are no checkpoints. You won't need them. My playtesting kids (age about 5 and 7 years) finished the game in about 55 Minutes and died about 10 times. So you will have no problem as well ;)",
