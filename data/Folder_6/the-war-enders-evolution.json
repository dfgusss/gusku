    "About the game": "I am appreciated that you are willing to play . This game is set in a near future, when you are one of the defense force belong to the Earth, and you have to defend the Earth from the alien invasion. Hope you can play the game again and again, and try to memorize how enemies act to progress the game. Then enjoy the game. At first I only thought about making the game. Then I push this game go through multiple updates. Finally it becomes this game, and it has been totally different from the original game. This game tends to make the feeling of arcade bullet hell game. This game is relatively faster, but the bullet pattern is not that hard. Good luck fighting. ———————————————————————————————————— Contact the Author: If you know how to contact me, just send me message and I will reply.

The score multiplier will increase by destroying enemies or using style mechanics (which will be explained in Energy part). The multiplier will drop in a speed of 0.02 per frame after 0.8s of the destruction of an enemy. Each kill will refresh that 0.8s. Multiplier can also be acquired by grazing enemy bullets, however, graze does not refresh that drop delay. Each 8.00 multiplier will increase rank by 1. When any enemy is hit, multiplier will stay for 0.1s, except for the boss. The score multiplier is shown on the top left of the game window. Energy: Destroying enemies to get energy. More dangerous enemy will give more energy. Energy can also be acquired by grazing enemy bullets. Style activation will consume 5.0 energy. The player will be invincible in this 6 seconds if uses Shield style. When player has a shield, catching bullets can increase the multiplier. Each bullet for 0.3 multiplier and it can hold the dropping of multiplier. Even the shield after taking hits has this effect. The fire power of player will be 1.5 times higher in 8 seconds if uses Hyper style. Destroy enemies during hyper gives more than triple the multiplier gotten from enemies' destructions. Boss will give less. Energy is shown on the right bottom of the game window. Rank: Higher rank means more difficult. Each rank will increase enemies' bullet speed. The lowest rank player can get is 0. The highest rank player can get is 50. Each style activation will increase rank by 5. If hit by enemy, the rank gotten from style will be divide by 2. Rank is shown on the up middle of the game window. Rank = (multiplier / 8.0) + style rank Score = score for destroying enemy * multiplier * difficulty multiplier. Current score is shown on the up left side of the game window. Local high score is shown on the up right side of the game window. ———————————————————————————————————— Player's Weaponry: Type 1: Slower speed, and potentially higher damage against swarms.
