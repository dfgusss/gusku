Collaborate to overcome obstacles and escape the mansion to gain your freedom for this second life, or be forever kept as an experimental guinea pig. Cooperate: Escape the mansion by cooperating and communicating with your teammate. This might prove to be the hardest challenge of this adventure but also the funniest game of 'I told you so' you have played for a while. Use your head: Many enigmas and challenges pave the way to freedom. Use your creativity and solving skills to overcome the various yet unique difficulties you will encounter. Enjoy: Frightened by the word enigmas or puzzle ? Do not worry as help can be requested in the game. If you are stuck on a challenge, you will be able, after some time, to ask for hints to lead you to the solution and even the solution itself if needed. For everyone: Whether you are actively invested in another game or looking for a new experience, 'To Be Headed Or Not To Be' has been designed to be done in 2 to 4 hours. It fits perfectly during a rainy Sunday afternoon or for a break during a week evening. So pick a friend, pick a drink and spend an evening scratching your head and enjoying together !",
