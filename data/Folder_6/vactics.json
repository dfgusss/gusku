    "About the game": "This is Solitude City in 2085 AD, it is the year of the Vactic uprising. We must build a mech to fight the robotic Vactics and liberate the city. But the teckno-paradise city itself also stands in your way. It is constantly changing the layout of its districts and streets. Each mech we bring into battle will face a new randomly generated challenge to overcome in this turn-based strategy game. Key Features Become a Mech Builder: Construct a Mech using 12 different types of tech that can be altered with dozens of tech mods and arcane cores. Master the chess-like strategy: The Vactics will show us where they are going to move and attack. Use their actions against them and inflict maximum damage on their forces. Activating the mech's tech will not end the turn so using them at the perfect moment will turn the tide of battle. Save the City: You are just one citizen of Solitude City. The people are working together to salvage mechs for the fight so even if you fail there will be tech to begin the fight once more on. Overcome the challenges: Complete the list of over 50 Achievements , activate additional gameplay Escalations and fight in the Daily District challenge mode to fully dominate the Vactics. Complete the Codex: The history and lore of Solitude City is out there to be discovered. Every Vactic we fight, tech we salvage and modify and district we complete has a story to tell.",
