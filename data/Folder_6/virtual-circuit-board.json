    "About the game": "Virtual Circuit Board , or VCB , is a sandbox-only drawing-based logic simulator featuring an assembler and a powerful simulation engine. All of it designed to give you the freedom to build and experiment with logic circuits to your heart’s content. Set your own goals In VCB you will set your own goals of what and how you want to build, it does not comes with tutorials, levels, or challenges, and it will not teach you digital logic or assembly. VCB 's development philosophy is aimed toward delivering a fresh sandbox experience for players who already have some basic knowledge about logic gates and circuits. Powerful Simulation High-performant deterministic simulation with adjustable speed and the ability to pause and advance by steps. Simulate with a frequency of up to millions of updates per second. Assembly Assembly editor where you can define your own instructions to create a program that will be assembled to a Virtual Memory that can be accessed by your circuits. Editing and Simulating Working in VCB is separated in two modes, while editing you can use the drawing tools to modify your circuit and the assembly editor to write programs, and during simulation you can see your circuit running, interact with it, and watch the assembly instructions being executed. Drawing-based Interface Build circuits by drawing color-coded entities like logic gates and traces, and use the specialized tools such as the Array to optimize your workflow by drawing multiple traces simultaneously. Both the electronic components and the traces support multiple input and output connections. Decoration Customize the appearance of circuits by drawing in the decoration layers that override the component's default colors. This allows you to create things such as buttons and labels that change appearance depending on the component's state.",
