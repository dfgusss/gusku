    "About the game": "Add the full game of Westwood Shadows to your wishlist: /[/url] [i]Reality... Reality is subjective. One day you’re a small-town cop, the next your world turns upside down. You think you’re out on routine patrol, but it’s an endless, living nightmare. I know. I live it every day. My name is Peter Bennet, and I’m a Detective. Not long ago I discovered that Westwood was built on lies. When the rotten foundation of what I called my home collapsed, it took my family with it. I’m not sure how, or why, but their death wasn’t an accident. Coming back to Westwood opened a box of memories and unfinished business; a box that could never be closed again. I knew that whatever the cost to get the answers that I needed, it wouldn’t even come close to what I’ve already paid in blood. The answers I found…were worse than I could’ve imagined. There are shadows in Westwood…and I think I know why.[/i] Westwood Shadows: Prologue introduces the story of Peter Bennet, a detective unraveling a surreal mystery in his abandoned hometown. He soon finds that not everything in Westwood is what it seems, that there are deadly shadows clawing at his mind, and that the mystery might have answers he doesn’t want to know. The experience will continue with Westwood Shadows (Coming in 2022) and feature combat, a greater variety of riddles and puzzles, and other exciting mechanics. We are looking forward to community feedback and an even better development process as we grow.
