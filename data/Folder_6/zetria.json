    "About the game": "Meet Solana! Equipped with her advanced NX-37 Combat Harness and trusty sidearm, Solana has ventured out on the border sectors to find her way as a salvage and rescue operator. During one of her regular runs to the debris fields of the abandoned Zetrian system, she picks up a distress signal and sets down on a frigid exoplanet to discover the source. Help her! Zetria is a pixel/retro style platformer with action and puzzle elements. Help Solana jump, shoot and think her way through the perils and dangers ahead to rescue the missing facility workers! There are nine levels in total, and a few secret areas to find and unlock too. Enjoy the rewards! Zetria is made from fully hand-crafted pixel art, from the environments to the alien monsters making up the cast. There's plenty of fully adult-only, hand animated and fully voiced encounters, all rendered in 256px pixel art sprites!",
