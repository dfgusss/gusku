I am a single father, my wife Rosa died 15 years ago. Those tyrants from the organisation named Kiminster Laboratories killed her.

In my case, I have a special perception that allows me to know where to go when I am in danger. Elise, well, she can... (The door of the cell where Owen is starts opening slowly) What?
