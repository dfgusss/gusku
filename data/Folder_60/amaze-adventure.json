Based on paper maps my friend and I would pass each other in Elementary class. We would create mazes for the other to trace through with a pen and explore. We would add in hidden secrets, puzzles, and quests to move on to the next sheet of paper, a new maze. Keeping track of inventory on a separate sheet and requiring that we had to draw every move on the maze paper. That way the map creator could see what the other person had done to explore each unique map. Hopefully, this game captures some of that exploration and adventure.",
