Steam Achievements Steam Cloud (Coming soon) Originally, we had Steam Trading Cards in this list too, but we were attended at the fact pure free games don't get that option. How can this be free? There must be a catch! No catch! No depleting in-game currency every time you attempt to date a character, no in-game shop prompting you to buy more parts for your character. It's all there for you to enjoy for free . This game has seen many years of spare-time development, and all of it wouldn't have been possible without the support of our loyal Patrons.
