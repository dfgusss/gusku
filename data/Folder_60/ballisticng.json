    "About the game": "BallisticNG is an anti-gravity combat racer and the ultimate AG modding sandbox developed as a love letter to the original Wipeout trilogy. Set in the year 2159, you glide through futuristic courses armed to the teeth with deadly weapons to aid you in taking first place. With a laser focused and authentic recreation of the PS1 Wipeout game physics, merging the best of each entries handling into one streamlined experience, BallisticNG returns AG racing to its glory days of technical piloting mechanics that are immensely satisfying to master. Features A track for every skill level, a ship for every play style With 52 hand crafted tracks and 16 unique ships in the base game, BallisticNG has something for everybody. Start slow, go as fast as you can handle With 5 speed classes and gameplay modifiers to manipulate the base speed of each class, you can race at speeds anywhere between a snail's pace or breaking the sound barrier on every straight Smart Assists New to anti-gravity racers? No problem! BallisticNG features assists that aid with steering, pitching and airbrakes independently. These work by letting the game's AI make input suggestions to your ship, which adapt to your own inputs so it stays out of the way when not needed. A campaign to test your skills Push your skills with 98 events spanning across 10 campaign blocks. Eliminate those who stand in your way Pick up weapons from the track and blast your way through the competition. Custom Races Pick a gamemode, configure it, add up to 16 racers with whatever difficulty you want and jump straight in. Gamemodes: Race, Tournament, Time Trial, Speed Lap, Eliminator, Knockout, Survival and Upsurge Multiplayer Play with others in two player splitscreen or online via direct IP or Steam. Onlline multiplayer is cross-platform across Windows, OSX and Linux and supports custom ships and tracks! VR Compatible BallisticNG is fully compatible with SteamVR. Jump into the cockpit of your favourite ship and strap yourself in for the ride of your life! (the cockpit view is also available outside of VR) Soundtrack BallisticNG features a thumping soundtrack featuring over 3 hours of music inspired by old school electronic genres. Any updates to the soundtrack are also added to the soundtrack DLC at no additional cost.
