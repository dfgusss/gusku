    "About the game": "Bio Inc.: Redemption is a complex biomedical simulator in which you make life or death decisions. Create the ultimate illness to infect and torment your victim or play as the head of a medical team and hopefully find a cure to save your patient. Will you be the plague or preserve humanity? Including over 600 actual diseases, virus, symptoms, diagnostic tests, treatments and other medical conditions, Bio Inc.: Redemption is frighteningly realistic. It will captivate you for hours, bringing you into a microscopic world of epic plague proportions! As the sequel to the worldwide mobile hit Bio Inc. (enjoyed by over 15 million players), Bio Inc.: Redemption was rebuilt from the ground up to make it the most realistic and visually stunning medical condition simulator available. CHOOSE YOUR SIDE Bio Inc.: Redemption includes two all-new campaigns! Choose Death and explore your dark side by wrathfully terminating victims using an agonizing combination of diseases and medical conditions. Be the Plague! Choose Life and you heroically play as a medical diagnostician to identify and cure diseases before it is too late for your patient. Save the human race one human at a time! Each campaign consists of nine cases with four different difficulty levels and the new adaptive AI system provides hours of gameplay with great replay value. BUILDING DEEP STRATEGIES The mechanics of Bio Inc.: Redemption are simple to grasp yet extremely deep. Casual players will appreciate a quick and exciting challenge. Advanced players will have to elaborate complex strategies to solve high difficulty cases.
