    "About the game": "Cascade Tactics is a tactical RPG full of interesting and interactive abilities. Hire your team, choose your classes, upgrade your equipment, and take on a variety of missions. Created by a solo developer, Cascade Tactics seeks to recreate the fun of customizing and progressing a squad of characters (Final Fantasy Tactics or Tactics Ogre). Cascade Tactics' strengths reside in its strategic gameplay, extremely smart AI, and highly customizable team. Three Game Modes! Epic Mode for story-mode players Roguelite Mode for competitive players Survival Mode for a more challenging story-mode Interactive Mechanics : Many actions take time before they are executed. This gives the opponent time to react. Deal damage to the caster to stop the action. Move / Push / Teleport units into or out of danger. Protect the target with another action before he is hit. Change the target of the caster with Silencer's Redirect. These opportunities allow the battles to feel fun and interactive. Status Effects are linked (or channeled). Deal damage to the caster to stop the status effect. Features a Dual-class system with interesting synergies. A Commander can issues commands to other units. A Ninja can attack twice with his weapon. When a character's two classes are Commander and Ninja you can issue commands to other units to attack twice. A Sentinel can guard tiles with his weapon. A Pyromancer can deal damage to an area with Flames. When a character has both classes, he can guard locations with Flames: casting it anytime an enemy walks on the tile. An Archer can add any magical ability to his weapon attack. An Ice Mage can cast Ice spells. When combined, you can freeze a target with your weapon. A Lancer can add cast time to his weapon to deal more damage or add cast time to a spell to increase its area-of-effect.",
