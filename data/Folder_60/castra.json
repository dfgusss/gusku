    "About the game": "This is a game where strategic decision making can turn the tide from victory to defeat. You will build your army, order movements, and execute attacks. As you begin conquering territories, you must balance available resources and units to protect what you've gained. The world map is used to plan attacks, and decide which controlled territories need to be reinforced. While controlling more territories will generate more resources, you may find yourself stretched too thin. Striking the right balance between expansion and defense is an important skill in this war of conquest. Each faction has a military camp where buildings can be constructed. Production buildings such as the barrack, factory, and airstrip produce units once constructed. Balancing resources and constructing the right units can make the difference between victory and defeat when an attack comes. Varying unit combinations require strategic forethought and accurate predictions of enemy attacks. Each unit gains an advantage against specific units and has weaknesses against others. This means unit combinations play a critical role in the outcome of battles. This rock-paper-scissors style of balance creates strategic depth in the game.",
