Fight in the evolving singleplayer campaign, master your skills in Conflicts missions, or compete with other players in the explosive team-based multiplayer modes. Evolving singleplayer campaign Fight in the evolving singleplayer campaign and make a difference in a conflict of global proportions. After the Iran-US RQ170 incident, in which a UAV was hacked and captured through cyber warfare, the US army secretly revived the development of the RAH-66 helicopter program for special operations. The goal was to develop a highly maneuverable and advanced stealth war machine capable of deploy low-range drones operating in high-risk environments. The program was a total success, and the Comanche special units seemed unstoppable in their missions. But then, when the blueprints leaked through a whistleblower website, every group, and power, who could afford it, built and modified the Comanche for their purposes. With that, a new era of helicopter warfare had begun. Skill-based Conflicts missions Master challenging missions in singleplayer game mode called Conflicts. Complete different objectives, earn medals for special tasks, and learn about Tellus Task Force's world, the part of IJTF. Each medal provides its challenge, so prepare to test your skills!
