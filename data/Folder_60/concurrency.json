    "About the game": "Concurrency is a roguelike with absolutely NO secret to be discovered. Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to investigate any strange occurrences or distortions. These randomly generated halls loop back to the store every time. You follow this track, kill procedurally generated goopmen, and purchase upgrades from the shopkeeper. This game has no hidden levels, genres, or bosses. Stay and do your job. If you leave, you will die. Probably many times. Key Features Plenty of upgrades in the shop to keep you docile!
