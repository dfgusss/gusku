    "About the game": "(Corrupted Hospital VR does not support WMR) ☆★ Review Event! ★☆ Hello. Thank you for playing our game. We fixed and updated some glitches of the Corrupted Hospital VR series and are working on the next game project. We expect it to be released in July. It is an adventure game of fantasy genre like a fairy tale, and it has excellent graphics that everyone will like. We are very focused on implementing features to make it a great game. To make this game perfect, we're going to refer to the elements that were praised in the previous game. But there was a lack of reference to what elements were fun and novel in the previous game. If you leave comments on what was good about SummonerVR, it will help us create the next game. If you could give your comments to CUSTOMER REVIEWS on the Corrupted Hospital and Silent Mention Store page, We're going to draw some good reviews and send you the game key for the next game. If you write a good review on both games, we will send you the key to the next game. PS. Those who have already written will be included in the draw! Thank you! --------------------------------------- Game Introduction --------------------------------------- This game is a puzzle adventure game with a horror atmosphere. The game is set in Dawn Wood Hospital, located in a town invaded by a summoner. You have to sneak into this Dawn Wood Hospital, find clues, and find Dr. Arnold's whereabouts. There are hints and pitfalls throughout the dreary hospital. It's a puzzle-based game where players can experience action and fear. Players can also search abandoned cars and open drawers for items and use discarded vending machines to get items. You have to be brave to escape from an urgent situation! A horror experience with high-quality graphics. It gives you the illusion that you are there! There is a special stage that is able to enter after you clear all stages.
