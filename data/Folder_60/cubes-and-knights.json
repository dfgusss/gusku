    "About the game": "You are the best warrior of the King, and you have a task: to find an ancient evil, an immortal necromancer who hides in the depths of the dungeons. You are good with melee weapons, however, this may not be enough for the success of your mission. Dungeon labyrinths were built a long time ago. Many secret passages, lost artifacts, wandering merchants. All of these can strengthen you! Magic staves will give you opportunities that exceed any melee weapon. Elixirs will fill you with fortitude, stamina and health. Ancient rings will give unusual abilities that you could not even think of. Make your way through the dungeons, crush their walls and their defenders - to find and challenge the ancient necromancer. And in the event of your death, well, it's okay: the King will send the next knight on this deadly mission. --- Game features. - Permanent death: if the knight dies, then the King's task will have to be completed by another. The King has many knights. - Fighting with swords: the emphasis in the combat system is on melee weapons. In addition to normal attacks, knights can also push opponents away and parry their attacks. - Items: There are a lot of items hidden in the dungeons that will help you in battles. - Secret locations: a particularly attentive knight will be able to find secret corridors and halls, sometimes with tangible benefits for himself. - Merchants: occasionally knights will find peaceful characters, and in secret locations they will be able to purchase amplifying artifacts from them. The technical side. - I wrote the engine code in C++, this is a software renderer. This means that the whole picture is being built by the CPU forces. - I used Code::Blocks, GCC, VisualStudio, Sleepy, Blender, GIMP, Audacity to create code, models, textures and sounds. - In general, the project is inspired by games from the 90s, that era of early 3D on the PC.",
