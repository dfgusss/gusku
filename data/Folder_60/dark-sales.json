    "About the game": "Dark Sales is a 2D action RPG that takes place in a modern office setting. It was built from the ground up by a single developer over the span of 2 years. Welcome to Nardrol, a dark world run by cruel supervisors and ruthless bosses. Lower level employees are treated like dirt to be trodden upon and the tyranny of the elite reigns supreme. Prophecy tells of a Chosen Salesman which will bring an end to the endless cycle of pain and seemingly random firings which plagues the land. Your time has come to bring truth to the legend. Enter Dark Sales. FULL DISCLOSURE - There is a very elusive bug we've been trying to find and fix which causes the player to roll endlessly. We have been so far unable to reproduce the bug ourselves but a small number of players have reported the issue. If you encounter the bug simply exit the game through the menu and reload it and it will be fixed with no loss of progress. If you do happen across this bug please let us know via our contact email OpticScatter@gmail.com with any details you can give. Thank you!",
