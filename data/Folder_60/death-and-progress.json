    "About the game": "A girl wakes up in a strange facility with no memories of where she is or even who she is. Death traps are everywhere, some need to be deactivated, some can be avoided, and some are simply impossible to pass without dying. But death wasn't the end. Every time she died, a strange machine brings her back to life. It becomes clear that the only way for her to move forward through these horrible tests... is to die over and over again. Death and Progress is a light horror game filled with puzzles and traps inspired by other Japanese horror RPG like Witch's House and Ib. Death is around every corner, but dying is not necessarily a bad thing, and sometimes it is the only way to proceed. Can you find your way through the traps? - Find your way out through a series of puzzles and traps - Three stages with varying environments - Four different endings - Unique death traps with different solutions - Hidden solutions that opens up new ways to avoid traps - Replay the levels for clues to escape a horrible fate",
