    "About the game": "Dodge Dummy Dodge Dummy is a game where you play a Dummy lost in a beautiful landscape full of circular saws and pillars from heaven. You have to run for your life, but where do you stop? It's a Side Scroller, and the only thing you have to do is jump and slide in order to avoid the obstacles. The game gets progressively more difficult the further you run. Your goal is to reach a preferably high score while not getting hit by any obstacle. How far can you go?",
