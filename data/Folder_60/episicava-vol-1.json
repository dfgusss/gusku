    "About the game": "Story Fifty years ago, the face of the Earth was permanently changed when it came into contact with a mysterious force known as the “Alpha Nebula.” As a result, humans developed various supernatural abilities and divided themselves based on those traits. The main factions include: The Tonitrui, the Excedente, the Praecantator, the Permuto, and the Northmanni. Each has their own unique set of abilities that came with the collision – with the exception of the Northmanni, who remain largely unchanged. Among these races, however, existed a special group of people who managed to retain all the other races’ abilities. They were a very powerful - but small and isolated group - known as “Emulators.” Arin Arlento was one of these people, living in a remote village with his grandfather and other members of their race; everything was peaceful until the Northmanni Empire massacred the Emulators and kidnapped his childhood friend, Aria. The only other survivor, Arin escaped into the Northmanni’s home continent of Rakos, hiding and plotting his revenge – that is, until he found out that Aria was still alive and was being experimented on. Loathing the world that took everything away from him, Arin begins his quest to retrieve his friend and exact retribution on those who destroyed all that he held dear. It’s one misguided man against the world… About Betrayed, defeated, and left alone in the cruel wilderness, the story follows our protagonist, Arin Arlento, and his quest for retribution; one that questions friendship, revenge, and human nature itself. Surrounded by a cast of quirky heroines, the story features a selection of scenes which range from slice of life to heart-breaking sadness to nail-biting action. Features Volume one features roughly 5-10 hours of play arising from a word count of more 150K+, more than 40 CGs and 20+ music tracks. The first volume contains the common route progressions through the tribes of Fulgur and Tribus, as well as Aniam and Alacria's routes.",
