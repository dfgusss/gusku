    "About the game": "Take control of your cluttered desktop and make way for a clean creative workspace with Fences 3, the perfect Windows organizational solution. Fences 3 has a little something for everyone: it collects your icons, files, and folders in shaded areas that can be hidden with a simple double-click, and even creates desktop pages you can swipe through for easy sorting. Creatives will appreciate the extra desktop space created by tucking files away in nearby Fences while they paint, design, edit and more. Project-based files and assets are where they need to be, one click away, exactly when you need them. Fences can also be dragged anywhere on the desktop, snapped to the sides, spread across multiple pages, or even rolled up with the click of a mouse. If you stream or create video content, instantly make your desktop viewer friendly by activating Fences to eliminate all icons in an easy double-click. Ready to bring them back to the desktop? Double-click again to make all of your Fences reappear exactly where you left them. Tired of searching through dozens of icons to find what you need or simply looking for a way to keep your favorite games in an easy-to-find section on your desktop? Then Fences 3 is the tool for you.
