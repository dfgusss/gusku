Winning respect from the true-born Imperials by skill and dedication, Jack plans out his future with his loved one. Yet everything changes, then an eerie murder smashes the tranquil atmosphere in town. Genie’s story has a special place between horror, suspense and detective genres mixing elements from all three of them and spicing them up with human relationships. The main focus goes with suspense/thriller theme. The story tries to catch the swirl of emotions wherever you play hide and seek with a murderous maniac or in a less dramatic situation.

Personal reading experience - choose your an appropriate font from more stylish to classic variations.",
