    "About the game": "Have you eaten yet？ Glutton Man is an indie barrage game. In the game,the player plays a glutton that can eat the enemies' remote attack and turn it into its own power. All bullets can be a delicious food,except for the enemy itself and the skulls. Please note that the Devourer must eat bullets with mouth. Attack from behind or sides still cause harm. The Devourer will digest the barrage swallowed and convert it into energy. When the energy is full, the Devourer will get a random weapon or get invincible for seconds.
