Search for magical creatures, rare animals and the hidden world in this simulation game. Have you ever wondered what lurks in the forest? In addition to birds and rabbits, what really hides. What if I told you the legends are true. All that told through generations really exists and today with this Grimoire you will be able to find them. Join the Guild of Arcane Investigators, experts in mystical creatures and the occult, delve into the forest for clues and information and find out what we're up to. Many animals, legends, myths and 'Things' will be added over time with a forecast of at least 28 MOBs.
