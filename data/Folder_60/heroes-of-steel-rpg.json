    "About the game": "Born in a medieval time of warring gods and dark powers, your heroes embark on a grim journey set in the immense post-apocalyptic world of Steel. Heroes of Steel is a turn-based tactical combat RPG in which you choose and lead a group of four unique characters, each with their own talents, special powers, and abilities. As you traverse the sprawling world of Steel, your party will face myriad challenges, battles, extensive mazes and fearsome enemies of all varieties. Difficulty is adjustable and an easy playthrough is available, but we made this game for the old-school RPG lovers who relish coming up with smart tactics and well-chosen ability combinations to take on challenges. You decide how to develop each character’s capabilities &amp; combat strategy, building a powerful team capable of triumphing over impossible odds. It is the dawn of the Seventy First Year after the world has fallen. Four of the Thirteen Gods rose up against their creator, the All-Father, and destroyed him in a cataclysmic event. In the following years of darkness and ruin, the kingdoms of man fell in war and flame. In the final days before all was lost, under the guidance of an ancient order of druids, the survivors retreated to a massive underground labyrinth; the mysterious Underdeep. Now the last remnants of humanity are scratching out a living in the Underdeep, still trying to rebuild their society. But they’re discovering that evil has caught up to them beneath the surface. Now, it’s up to you to unravel the mysteries of what’s happening and overcome the darkness. Equip each of your characters with weapons, armor, mundane or magical accessories -- thousands of gear combinations. Decide how to increase everyone’s attributes &amp; skills to create a party that suits your playstyle. Choose between hundreds of talent progressions, coming up with clever combinations &amp; tactics to use in turn-based combat against ferocious, devious, and magical enemies who threaten humanity's last settlements. --- The Trese Brothers have been playing and making tabletop roleplaying games since we were kids.
