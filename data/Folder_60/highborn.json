    "About the game": "This witty, wacky, turn-based strategy game is now available for Steam. In Highborn, you’re treated to a strategy game that offers an intelligent, tactical experience without the frenetic play of a traditional RTS. Move your forces around an overhead map to secure spells and combat support, then dive into combat to deploy those advantages against an unsuspecting enemy. All the fun and fighting is set against an irreverent tale, filled with wacky heroes, witty dialogue and wild assumptions. Key Features: A New Strategy: A unique blend of strategic movement and combat caters to a variety of gameplay styles and offers lots of replayability. Many Styles of Play: Unlock hero characters for access to different abilities, play styles, and strategies. Achieve Greatness: More than 20 achievements to unlock, including judicious use of turns, using units as bait, and making it through an entire mission without capturing support structures.",
