    "About the game": "Solve clever puzzles and uncover an intriguing story full of mystery and wonder. With “light and shadow” as a core concept, Iris.Fall takes players on a monochrome adventure unlike any other. Story background: After awakening from a dream, Iris follows a black cat into a dilapidated theater, traveling back and forth through a strange labyrinth of light and shadow. As the story unfolds, Iris begins to realise that everything in this theater seems to have some kind of hidden connection to herself. Key Features • Unique monochrome art style The game’s visuals use a pure black-and-white cartoon style, relying on the transition between light and shadow to create a distinct experience, both exquisite and visually impactful. • Fusing gameplay and the “light &amp; shadow” system The concept of “light and shadow” runs throughout the design of the game’s art, story, and puzzles. By switching between light and shadow, players can pass through the two realities, experiencing the unique interlacing of black and white, light and shadow, 2D and 3D. • Immersive story experience Become fully immersed in the plot through the stylized and suspenseful atmosphere of the setting and story. Progress in the game feels more like the player’s spiritual exploration.",
