About the project: ITERRIA ZONE game with dynamic gameplay. You have to fight the hordes, of the humanoid creatures they were the result of a inaccuracy in the genetic code of a vaccine that was applied to humans.. The main objective of the game is complete tasks, destroy hordes, and survive among the apocalypse :) Basic mechanics: Dynamic gameplay Horde of enemies Special Enemies Survival Stealth mode Protection base and allies Search for items Allied AI Lot of shooting :) Important Disclaimer: As I'm making this game alone as an independent developer and with limited budget, I don't have any deadlines or limitations making ITERRIA ZONE. Game will be depending on the community to give me feedback about what's interesting and what's not, and thank you in advance for giving me a shot! However, I gonna say, I really enjoy destroying of hordes of enemies and I've noticed that there are not many such kind of games. I've started creating this project as an experiment, and I also have learned a lot as the game grows. I am glad that now i can share it with you. It will help to develop it faster.",
