    "About the game": "What is it? Have you ever had an obsession? Anything. To buy a sports car, to build a country house, to find true love, to collect all rare stamps? What is it? Dream? The purpose of life? Or is it just a mental parasite that has settled in your mind? Any way, your life is no longer a mere existence. Now it is the path. A path that can lead anywhere. A path full of difficulties and questions. The main character is an example of a person who goes to his goal. No matter what it is, no matter how big it is. For example - the main character is looking for milk. Does it sound silly? Let it be. How does it feel? Katharsis is a first person exploration game, where you will face a bunch of choices and simple puzzles. Sooner or later those choices will lead you to the end of a story. There are a few endings and together they will provide a full game experience. But remember - there is no true ending . Every ending is just a piece of a core message that game is trying to say.",
