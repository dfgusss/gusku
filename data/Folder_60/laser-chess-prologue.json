Deflection is a strategy board game, inspired from the classic Laser Chess games and the famous board game Khet. Move and rotate different pieces to destroy the enemy with your laser! With a variety of pieces each having different advantages, abilities and weaknesses, use the one move you are allowed per turn to strategically bring you closer to victory.
