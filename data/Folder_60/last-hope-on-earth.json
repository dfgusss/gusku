Play alone or gather your friends in order to clear the Earth of all the monstrosity created by radiation, with combat mechanics and inventory prepared exclusively for Last Hope on Earth. What you should expect: The world is Yours Use the resources of the world around you to create shelters, weapons, tools and many other items that will help in your adventure as the last hope on Earth. Do not starve Food is scarce, and hunger can be severe. Collect fruits offered by the environment, hunt wild animals (or make friends) and cook for you and your group to stay alive in this desolate world. Home Sweet Home Create your home or fortress and get ready to face bigger and bigger enemies in the different regions of Oldlands, the map of Last Hope on Earth. Take an Umbrella The climate in Oldlands can be intense due to the major climate changes caused by radiation. So it is better to prepare yourself to face climates such as storms, rain and lots of snow. Nuclear Aberrations Battle alone or in a group against several different bosses encountered by the Oldlands. But remember: it is better to prepare well before facing an enemy of this level!",
