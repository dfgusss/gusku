    "About the game": "Can you survive wave after wave of pure alien onslaught? Shoot, loot and capture defense points to crawl your way to new levels even more challenging than the previous ones. Aliens lay siege on Mars’ first resort as you and your crewmates attempt to regain control of the hotel’s floors. Capture and maintain control over defense points whilst fending off a hungry hive of angered aliens, and crawl your way through the key areas in the hotel. Choose from a variety of weapons and upgrades, all unlockable either during or at the end of runs. Fully tailor your loadout to your preferred playstyle and adapt to increasingly dangerous situations by managing your inventory in between rounds. Find other players, leave feedback &amp; suggestions and share your cool moments in our community discord! Last Resort is a student project developed by team Soupvision, a group of 29 students over the course of one academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Working online has been a new experience for all of us, and we're thrilled to finally be able to release this game. We'd be thrilled to hear what you think about it!",
