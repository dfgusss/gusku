Though there is lots of free updates and content being released. The whole game is a huge puzzle while each city is its own little piece of puzzling. There are nearly 50,000 cities to complete. Plenty of cities are easy enough. Some take complex planning. Do them in your own order. Get bonuses for completing countries, continents and contracts. Some cargoes are easy to get. Others you have to create in industries. Use existing industries and build your own. The further you get from the start the more strategies you have to use. Pimp up your transports with boosts. Last transport delivering gets the boost. The cities and map are to scale. Current or historical industry placement. It is very educational. There is plenty more to keep you on your toes. Cities consume the cargoes you are trying to get to completion. Big transports are great for moving lots of stuff, but can't travel everywhere. There are lots of broken transport routes that need deliveries. Upgrade the industries for better exponential throughput. Cargo stores can sure come in handy. ... and what is with those quarantine checkpoints? Complete cities, roads, industries, contracts, regions and states for lots of in-game and Steam achievements.
