    "About the game": "Ayana Tomori is a priestess who's next in line to inherit her family's shrine. She's a beautiful, intelligent, talented (and most of all, very modest!) young woman. She yearns for something more from life and wishes to escape the dull reality she faces every day. On a fateful, rainy night, the sound of lightning wakes her from her slumber. She's suddenly enveloped by a blinding light which, to her surprise, summons her into another world. There, the world's foremost god, Ashkelon, tasks her with the role of a hero in order to unite the kingdoms of humans, elves, and dwarves against the dark forces plotting to overthrow the very balance of the land. Will Ayana succeed in her quest? How will her experiences in this other world shape her life? Can she make it back to her own world, or will she even want to? Find out how her story unfolds! Explore the large open world as you see fit! You can either start small by talking with townsfolk, gathering intel in taverns and taking on sidequests, or you can hitch a boat ride to different kingdoms and advance the main story right away! Recruit party members with a variety of skills! Use whoever you want, whether it's the off-beat dragon priestess, the mysterious bard, or the werewolf woman with a tragic backstory. Your crew will learn different skills depending on what you equip them with, so you can experience something different in every playthrough. What's more, your choices throughout the story will affect Ayana's attributes, and she can either develop into a fierce warrior or a wise mage. Not to mention, your choices will affect the story itself. There are also numerous costumes to collect, a fitting feature for a fashionable young woman! Fantasy World to Explore The world of Magna Fortuna is sprawling and open, with lots of different possibilities for progression! Lots of Outfits to Collect Collect a number of different outfits for Ayana to wear, each unlocking new quests and jobs for her to take on in this fantasy world. Tons of Quests Journey forth on different quests, ranging from solving a murder mystery to investigating a suspicious shop in the woods. Varied Cast With a huge cast of characters, each with their own personality quirks, this adventure is bound to be interesting!",
