    "About the game": "A young teen finds herself alone, falling asleep. Suddenly, a loud thud and text messages from her sister ensues, waking her up. Someone is with her in the house. Terrified and petrified, she seeks help from her sister who has a connection to the CCTV in their house. She can’t escape because the doors are locked by the pursuer. The young teen struggles to find the safest place to hide herself, while at the same time trying to outsmart him. Sneak your way through an immersive first person 3D world. Hide yourself from a dangerous robber. Interact with various objects and rooms. Exchange helpful information via chatting through a phone. Founded by a bunch of then-undergraduate students from Bandung, Indonesia. The project has been rough and tough, mainly because we were university students. However, we dragged ourselves slowly to get sort of everything balanced. Now, here we are. Andreas Andika is responsible for the technical directing, Chandrika N. Dewi is taking care of the art directing, M. Irfan Permadi is the programmer, and Mira Wardhaningsih writes all the narrative.",
