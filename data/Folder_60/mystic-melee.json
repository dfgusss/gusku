    "About the game": "Mystic Melee brings you a spectacular mix of physics-based platforming and imaginative spells. You'll need to master both, playing as four arcane wizards facing the monsters and minions of an evil sorcerer who threatens the universe. Featuring SINGLE PLAYER campaign to hone your platforming and spellcasting skills, with leaderboards and recorded ghosts to race against. MULTIPLAYER battles with four players locally or online. Unique elemental spells that reward strategy and skill. Crush, slice, and incinerate your opponents with summoned rock golems, whirling leaf attacks, and volcanic strikes. Fluid physics-based platforming that's easy to learn and hard to master. Wall-jump, slide, and dash to outmaneuver enemies and complete challenges. Four multiplayer game types, including objective-based modes that have you controlling artifacts or scoring on an enemy goal, rewarding mastery of both combat and platforming.",
