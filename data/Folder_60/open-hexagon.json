    "About the game": "Open Hexagon is easy to learn but extremely hard to master. There are only four actions: spin clockwise , spin counter-clockwise , swap by 180° degrees , and focus (slow down) . If you want to beat the hardest levels, you'll need impeccable timing and precision. Simplicity and minimalism are key features of Open Hexagon. While some levels have special quirks and mechanics, the goal is always the same: survive as long as possible . Challenge your friends and family (or yourself) for the best survival times! Headbang your way through polygons by listening to the absolutely amazing chiptune and bitpop tracks by BOSSFIGHT , Dunderpatrullen , and Fantomenk . You'll want to keep listening even after you're done playing -- 100% guaranteed. Open Hexagon's main concept originates from the excellent Super Hexagon by Terry Cavanagh, who fully endorses Open Hexagon -- thanks! However, Open Hexagon expands on the formula by introducing a 180° swap mechanic , curving walls , accelerating walls , scriptable levels , and much more. Whether you're a veteran of arcade games or new to the genre, you'll find something fresh to spike up your adrenaline. Open Hexagon was developed with the goal of being open . Players can create their own levels by using the simple yet powerful Lua scripting language. The amount of freedom that level designers have is unprecedented: keep your levels simple, or go wild and implement brand new mechanics and even entire new games! If you have never coded before, Open Hexagon can be a great (and fun) introduction to programming. Open Hexagon features secure online leaderboards, backed up by a replay system and a cheat-prevention server. Are you brave enough to climb the ladders and claim the top scores? Play the game the way you want to. Speed up or slow down levels. Change the colors and the way the environments are rendered. Open Hexagon gives players the freedom to customize their game just the way they like to. Or take it one step further and modify the game engine itself, as it is fully open-source. Open Hexagon has been around for a while. Many players have spent countless hours becoming masters of the game or building incredibly creative custom levels.
