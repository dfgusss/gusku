    "About the game": "Ozapell Basic is a hobbyist programming language simple enough for new programmers -- while powerful enough to develop playable retro 1980s games. The graphics environment and interface are loosely based on early 1980s color home computers. The programming language is heavily inspired by modern languages (especially C and javaScript) while using BASIC keywords for simplicity. The supplied library provides enough functionality to create simple games and audio-visual demonstrations. Ozapell Basic was designed to be as simple as possible while providing a variety of features. It could be fun for someone who wants to program or make retro 1980s style games but doesn't want to learn a complicated modern language. Special features include: Steady 60fps performance Create executables for distribution Support for modern (CD quality) wave audio sound Alternate freely between line editor and fullscreen editor or use an external text editor Built-in speed limiter -- programs will run at same speed on fast or Minimum Specification systems or turn off the speed limiter for full processing speed Secured to prevent access to other folders and files Fullscreen and Widescreen 24-bit color Collision detection for sprites Partial mouse support for receiving clicks from left, right and middle mouse buttons Source code is (mostly) compiled to memory before starting instead of interpreting the source code during execution",
