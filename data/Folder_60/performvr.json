    "About the game": "You supply the music, PerformVR supplies the fun! You don't need to wait for someone to design a dance or karaoke map for your favorite songs, PerformVR does it for you in a matter of seconds! This isn't your typical dance generation either... Most VR rhythm games only detect a song's tempo, then match some predefined patterns to it. PerformVR works differently, understanding the context of a song, when measures start, segments &amp; more using university-developed algorithms. PerformVR will use all this information to make a custom dance and set of visuals for 4 different difficulty settings you desire. Easy options are provided in-game to correct dancing mistakes if the analysis is a bit off, which happens infrequently. Read more about it here ! A dancing robotic audience will react to how well you are doing. You will be scored against 100% perfection, so you know how well you are really doing (instead of obscure points) -- don't worry, getting 70% or better is really good and you will be graded from F to AAA+! kurohuku shows how it is done: PerformVR supports karaoke with any song you have &amp; will extract vocal timing and pitches automatically. This works for some songs better than others, and will occasionally pick up notes that are not vocals. PerformVR can automatically download imagery related to the song you are playing &amp; gather lyrics too. However, this features require some configuration which you can read more about in the community forum . PerformVR does not provide any music. It will default to looking in your music folder. Analysis can take 15-30 seconds, but only needs to be done once per song . It is compatible with all popular audio file formats (MP3, OGG, AAC etc.). Trailer music: NEFFEX - Grateful. Uses VAMP Plugins from Queen Mary, University of London (M. Mauch and S. Dixon) &amp; more...",
