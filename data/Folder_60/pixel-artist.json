    "About the game": "Pixel Artist is a relaxing PIXEL PAINTING game. Complete 48 unique and fun paintings in a variety of themes, art styles, and sizes in preset colors. Brush sizes, magic fill, selection color options, and more make this a soothing and calming way to spend your time. Zone out and join us in coloring! The goal of the game is simple: Relax and Paint through the images at your own pace. FEATURES: 48 Unique and Fun paintings. The paintings include a large variety of styles, themes, pixel count variation, and content! Brush sizes make painting how you like more convenient. If you're a pixel-by-pixel person or just like to color, there's an option for you. Magic Fill helps you fill larger areas of connected pixels. Watch it flood out and fill in your areas based on where you click. Change the color of your active painting area for easy visibility even in bright images. This also helps find those pesky last pixels! Palette options: A randomized palette everytime you play can make replaying a totally different experience. You can also list from least to most (or most to least) amount of pixels per color. Calming music lulls you while you play. (Or turn it off and jam out to your own music!) Change grid settings to what you like. Leave paintings in the middle and return to saved progress. Repaint completed images that you enjoyed! The palette auto-selects the next colors for a seamless coloring experience. Select colors in the painting area if you like to complete sections at a time. PAINT IMAGES!
