    "About the game": "The goal is to create a highly interesting drag racing game with satisfying controls and a very deep upgrading system! The game is designed for quick matches between you and your friends perhaps as a warmup. A game should take around 10 min. Therefore, challenge your friends and beat them up! You can also try to get the highest score on the global leaderboard and prove that you are the superior being. There are currently 4 cars, as shown below, and many different upgrades containing interesting bonuses. Combine these factors to create your own strategy and squeeze every last drop of power out of your car! Though be careful, the success of your strategy will ultimately depend on your keen awareness and skill about driving and the randomized cost of each upgrade. Best of luck! Car-pool: Decentra: Turbo powered beast that can either be the fastest or the slowest depending on driver-skill. Oldsroyal: Heavy old car that always gets a head start because of its guarenteed Tireboost! Fabulvania: Weak but light race car that has preinstalled NOS. Thoroughbred: Powerful American™ muscle-car that has weak boost times. Join my Discord server to chat and stay updated on tournaments and stuff:",
