    "About the game": "Story! Some time in the distant future, human soldiers have been replaced with combat ready machines. Unfortunately, a terrorist organization was able to hack into the machines and order them to turn their guns on their nations. The U.N. was able to pin point the enemies base and order a soldier, code name 'Ragnar', to sneakily infiltrate the base. His main mission is to find a way to put an end to this madness once and for all. Ragnar is a run-and-gun action platformer that is inspired by Contra. Which means it will be highly difficulty, but fair! What to expect! Ragnar is a run-and-gun action platformer which will be highly difficulty, but fair. The player character comes armed with a gun that can shoot infinitely. When defeating an enemy, a power-up may spring out onto the battlefield. Different power-ups can be picked up which will grant the player new bullet abilities. However, the power-up will be lost if the player comes in contact with an enemy’s bullet, while losing a life instantly. The character can shoot in five directions and can also crouch. Each level will be handcrafted which will guarantee to make them action packed. And yes, this game is paying homage towards Contra!",
