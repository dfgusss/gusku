    "About the game": "Journey across the Indian Ocean, uncover the secrets of the Drunken God, and become a legendary pirate captain. Rum &amp; Gun mixes fast-paced shooter action with ARPG loot and character progression. You're not on the Caribbean anymore... Notable features Enter an epic pirate adventure in single-player. Four acts worth of hand-crafted levels are waiting for you to be explored (Act IV is work-in-progress). Not that you'll remember any of it from all that drinking. Live the pirate's life: Drink the finest rum instead of those weird-colored potions and elixirs. Boost morale by playing your music instruments. Gamble your gold away in a game of Liar's Dice. Dominate the waves in naval combat. You may also hunt legendary beasts if you can solve their mysteries. ARPG? I say YARRRPG! Looting is a pirate's profession. There are 32 hat fashions, 25 weapon types, 15 species of pets and plenty more to collect. Every weapon can have up to 2 Spell Runes with their own level-ups, modifying their attacks in wild ways. Character perks aren't missing either. Customization is as deep as the seven seas! Gun is half the title! The core game loop is that of a hectic top-down shooter, but melee and spellcaster builds are also viable. Note that movement is with the keyboard, since you need the mouse for aiming. The game is also using an active reload system. Done with the story? Try it in LAN Co-op with as many mates as your network can handle, or make your own maps with the included map editor. You could even share them in the Steam Workshop. Made with dedication: The game is being made by one person since 2018, with a custom-built game engine and original assets paying homage to low-poly classics of times gone by. Kick a zombie in half while playing the fiddle! Borington is a one-man development project based in Transylvania. Rum &amp; Gun is my first desktop release, after 2 web-based projects.
