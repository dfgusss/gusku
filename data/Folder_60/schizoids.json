    "About the game": "Originally released in 1983, Schizoids was a classic top-down space game for the ZX Spectrum, where players took on the role of a space junk disposal technician. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Gameplay Try to survive for as long as possible, dodging the pods of space junk hurled at you, as well as the black hole in the centre of the screen. Your Space-Dozer is equipped with an anti-momentum shovel up front that can push the pods, and a skyhook to stabilise spinning pods on the back. Knock the pods safely into the black hole. Sending special pods called 'spangles' into the hole will gain you an extra Dozer. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
