    "About the game": "There's been several reports of disappearances in the neighbourhood of Lencour. You are given the hint that the old mansion in the mountains might just be the host of these mysterious disappearances. You feel the need to go see for yourself, but you also have no choices... Just as you decide to get your apparel ready, you receive a call from your niece announcing that her mother went to the mountains to investigate, but she never came back. Frantic, you pack your camera, take the bare minimum and rush to the mountains. An endless night is about to get down! Your goal: find your sister and survive this fatal night... This game is a FPS survival horror in the style of Resident Evil, Silent Hill and Outlast. Will you survive to find your sister and ultimately solve the puzzles lurking behind the madness? The game as been made entirely with the Smile Game Builder engine and as not been exported to Unity to customize it in any way! So this game is an example of what you can do with the SGB engine without any knowledge of programation whatsoever! Keep in mind when playing that this engine is made to creat JRPG and not FPS survival horror! The game can be played entirely in english or in french! Le jeu peut être joué entièrement en anglais ou en français! *If you have any problem installing the DLC uninstall the game and reinstall it at the same time as the DLC, it should fix it.* *The same process is needed to change the game language.*",
