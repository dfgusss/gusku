    "About the game": "You and your friends go to a mountain camping for the weekend. The path leads you to a detour road passing a ravine. In growing dusk, you cross a shaky bridge, resulting in your car falling to the depths of the darkness. Luckily, all passengers live, but the car is ruined. There is no signal. You are surrounded by an eerie forest. The night’s dark descends… There’s only one way out – to cross the forest and seek help in a small town called Danwille... Soon you realize that there are some strange, ominous and inexplicable things happening in the forest. Your way to salvation is a death trap, where every step, every breath can be the last. Make a mistake and it will cost you or your friends your lives. There’s death lurking in the silence of the cursed place. Was it a bird that made this spine-chilling sound in the twigs or was it something worse? Will you and your friends make it through the abominable forest without going mad? Will you find out the secrets of the place or will the silence devour you? FEATURES: Noise is triggered by players’ actions Forest is a gloomy place full of danger.
