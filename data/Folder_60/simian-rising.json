    "About the game": "Story You were abducted by the original crew of this ship. With a bit of help from an unexpected ally, you were able to take control of the situation. Now that crew has been reduced to their basic elements, sorted and stored in the hold to use for future repairs. Escape required some sacrifices. Your consciousness converted to an infinitesimal point, you now have the appearance of a luminous orb. You've also made enemies of some of the most powerful beings known anywhere. In order to survive, you've retreated to the fringes of the multiverse. Everything here is foreign and sparse in comparison to what you knew. Your ally assures you it's the safest place to begin recovery. Your abductors thought of you as an animal. They didn't believe you could comprehend their communications, but you picked up enough to figure out that they were amused by your genetic similarity to a chimp, and that they anticipated using you in some very cruel experiments. They picked a fight with the wrong simian. Current Features Take control of a ship with capabilities almost beyond imagination. Use it to exact revenge on the beings who forced you into this new and strange situation. Visit a vast array of worlds. Each has its own variety of sun, ocean, foliage, sky, day and night cycles, terrain, resources, and enemies. Collect resources by tunneling through terrain or chopping off mountain tops. Create portals to jump from one world to any other. Store absurd amounts of resources in your secure null-space dimension, and some on your ship to help with repairs. Save ship configurations and load them instantly to suit your circumstances. Did I mention you're an ultraterrestrial now? The rules you knew are no longer relevant. Challenge yourself with optional timed game modes. See how quickly you can get through a set of checkpoints or clear a world. Customize your ship by adding modules. Make it stronger, more efficient, or more specialized.",
