    "Name": "Skeleton King",
    "Release date": "Jan 26, 2021",
    "About the game": "Under the full moon's light of Halloween, a skeleton decides to grab fate by the bones and become nobility - the hard way. After all, if you collect every single crown in the crypt, you ARE the Skeleton King! Lose yourself in this relaxing, realistic runner while realizing it's really about a restless reliquary that's actually rather scary, due to the animated skeletons of course. To be honest it's not a bad excuse for a Halloween game that's eerily realistic looking. Your character moves faster as the games goes on, can slowly regenerate 'health', and dies when you run out. Obstacles remove a single hit point, while enemy skeletons cost you 5. Enemy Mummies will deal 10 damage, and Werewolves deal 50, so watch out! Use Left and Right keys (or A and D) to move left and right.",
