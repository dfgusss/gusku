'Slay the Dragon!' is a 3rd year student project from The Animation Workshop in Denmark. SYNOPSIS When Maj wishes for her little brother to disappear, a dragon swoops down to abduct him. Now, in order to rescue her little brother, Maj must traverse a fantastical landscape, overcome mighty foes, and ultimately reach the dragon's lair in order to slay her nemesis. 'Slay the Dragon!' is an isometric hack and slash game inspired by old school adventure games and the Swedish countryside. It is a fun game with a gorgeous artstyle, beautiful music and an overall mood of nostalgia. 'Slay the Dragon!' is a game suitable for all ages, but more importantly, it is targeted towards anyone who wishes to re-experience the wonders of childhood imagination.

COLLECT Be sure to pick up every juicy hallon berry you come across – perhaps collecting them all will change something at the ending?

We hope that you will enjoy the story as much as we did when creating it. Happy adventure!",
