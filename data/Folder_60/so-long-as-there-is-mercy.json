    "About the game": "What exactly is SlatiM? „So long as there is Mercy“ is a Point-and-Click Puzzle Adventure in which the player has to lead Spe, the game‘s protagonist, through an eerie dollhouse in an effort to find her little brother. On her way, Spe will encounter the ghost-children, who are also trapped, and can use their different abilities to solve the environmental puzzles in order to escape the house. What happened before? After their mother‘s death, Spe and her little brother Mercy stay with their father, who eventually marries an other woman. The two children face rejection from the new woman in the house, even when the father becomes seriously ill. After he dies, the will is read out, in which he bequeaths the entire family‘s property to his children. The stepmother is so angry with this decision that she locks Spe and her brother up in a dollhouse, where the siblings are separated. In search of her brother, Spe finds out the truth about the stepmother: she is a witch and swindler, who poisons her partners to receive the inheritance. Let‘s dive right into it! In order for Spe to get back to her little brother, she has to find the way through a number of mysterious rooms, which are guarded or locked by tricky mechanisms. On the journey through the maze, Spe meets the ghostchildren who can help her solve the puzzles by using their unique skills. One of them is Lucien. His ability is to spawn fire, which will help Spe to light the candles and fill the cold rooms with warm candlelight. Once she encountered a ghost child, she can pick it up and carry it with her. Every time Spe faces a challenge, the ghostchildren will bear a hand with their special abilities. Together with Lucien and the other ghost-children Spe encounters on her journey, she finds a way through the spooky rooms to hopefully be reunited with her brother again.",
