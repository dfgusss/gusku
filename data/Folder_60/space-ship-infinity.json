    "About the game": "- Gameplay Your ship cannot stop moving, then you must turn left and right and avoid colliding with an increasing amount of enemies. Your ship can fire all the time, so don't worry about ammo but make sure you destroy enemy ships often to keep yourself surviving and don't forget about power-ups to help you survive longer. Get the highest score possible by collecting coins to buy upgrades for your ship to become faster, more resistant and increase your firepower. - Features A throwback to the classic arcade game room of the 80s. Space Ship Infinity is a retro-style, addictive and fast-paced arcade shoot 'em up! Easy to learn, arcade style controls are simple to move and shoot. Keyboard and Mouse Support. Initially three power ups are Triple Shot, Double Points, Healer all to help your survival. Status upgrades available for your ship speed, health and damage. Collect coins to unlock power ups and upgrades to reach your best score. Infinite (infinite) survival chasing the best score game with a classic 'bullet hell'-like arcade style. Steam Achievements - Developer Notes I've been developing for some time but only recently started to pluck up the courage to publish my games I hope this is fun to play this is a small re-playable arcade where the only goals are to constantly beat your previous score and unlock some perks and improve skills. I will do my best to ensure support for my games. Lucas Lima - Made In House Studios",
