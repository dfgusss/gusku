Our game will help you remember, and if you haven’t been around for that, it will let you travel back in time to see! In our game, Spectrubes, you control a cube. But not one – several, and at the same time! The key idea is that they move very differently! One of the cubes may move up, but another one will move down. But not all cubes in the world of Spectrubes are friendly. Some of them are hostile, and will not let you freely enjoy your life. Avoid them unless you want trouble!
