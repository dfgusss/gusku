    "About the game": "The world is infested with giant mutated spiders. In Spider Crisis you operate a small remote control tank equipped with deadly weapons. Use your weapons to shoot, bomb, and burn these creatures back to where they came from. Locations Fight across 6 locations that are randomly picked at the start of a session. These locations have their own unique designs and layouts. Such as the dark atmosphere of a cave and sewer, abandoned workplaces of the downtown sector and factory, or the brightly lit tourist attractions of the ancient ruins and canyon. Upgrades Upgrades are available to the player in and out of sessions. You can level up and equip weapons for your tank or earn credits through completing sessions and spending them on level-up bonuses and chance upgrades in the main menu. While hitting certain levels the player can choose new weapons, additional defense systems, and drones to help them fight. Game Modes You can choose between 4 different game modes: Standard: Kill anything that moves. Lockdown: Hold a set position. Research: Kill and collect. Random: The objective for each location is randomly picked.
