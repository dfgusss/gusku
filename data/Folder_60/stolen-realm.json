Fight thrilling and fast-paced battles in procedurally generated hex-based battlefields with a Simultaneous Turn system where every team takes all its actions at once, mixing tactical depth with the thrill of action RPGs. Position your troops carefully to take advantage of cover, battle shrines that provide both you and your enemies with boosts, and other environmental elements and hazards. Every battle adapts to the number of characters involved, so you can easily jump in and out of the game even in the same playthrough! Loot hundreds of powerful items, gear up, and level up your characters picking among 240 skills from 8 different skill trees, with a flexible system that allows you to be pure class (fighter, wizard, ranger, and thief) or a mix of them. After each battle, pick your path between story events, resource gathering, shops and treasure rooms, until you get to the final boss of each procedurally generated adventure. If you’re up to a challenge, crank the difficulty up with 5 different difficulty levels – or pick Hardcore Mode with permadeath, where every battle can be the last!

RECOVER THE STOLEN REALM You can be a classic hero, donning a fighter’s armour, a thief’s knives, a ranger’s bow or a wizard’s robe and staff. Or you can break the mould to forge a champion all your own: a spell-slinging assassin, a priest born of frost or a shadow-infused knight. Explore a world that changes on each expedition. Climb frosty peaks guarded by the elusive Blue Dragon. Wiggle through overgrown jungles where the rock giants roam. Delve into deep dungeons where the undead rise. Split your opponents with a well-placed ice wall, while your thief sneaks through unsuspecting crowds to deliver the fatal backstab. Order the ranger to rain arrows on your foes as you take the Shrine of the Conqueror to devastating effect. Earn and reforge loot that truly changes the way you play. Wield Abbadon the Soul Crusher, a mythic mace that raises slain enemies as skeletal warriors to fight for you. Unsheath the Bloodletter, a cursed sword that grants additional power at the cost of your lifeblood. Carve a place in history with your sword and magic. Rise to honour and glory in the battlefield. Recover the Stolen Realm.",
