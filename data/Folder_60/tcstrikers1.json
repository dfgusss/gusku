    "About the game": "story A few years after she has started her own consulting office, the business was on track, and Techno was living a stable life. “Feels like we're always getting the same offer.” “That means you've become experienced (fat) to get to say that.” Techno trusts Joshua, who's been her assistant since the beginning. “Umm, I'll just take a walk for a while.” “I wanna drink some fizzy drink. Oops. Pushed the Oshiruko button. Good thing Joshua is gonna drink it anyway.” (What's that? A creature? So huge!) “What? Did anyone say something?” A woman dressed strange was looking at Techno, looking as if she was being stared at by a cow. (That creature is staring at me...Can that see me?) “What's the matter?” (Crap! Gotta run and tell my boss.) “Hey! Wait the hell up!” Techno ran after the woman dressed strange. ○User Guide Z: Shot(Decide) X: Bomb(Cancel) Shift: Charge When the charge is complete, release the shift: Laser Skip conversation •Hold down shot and bomb in the conversation.
