    "About the game": "You are a crew member of the USSC Lazarus waking up from cryo sleep without memories and even without name in an apparently abandoned drifting cargo spaceship. But you’re not alone, there is also Hybris, the Artificial intelligence who commands the ship. Who are you? What are you doing there? What is the Black Cube? The Truth Is Darker Than Space. WELCOME TO THE USSC LAZARUS The game takes place aboard the USSC Lazarus (Unified Space Ship Companies), a ship that belongs to KR Corporation (Kross-Rübel), a company dedicated to the interstellar transport of goods and with close ties to the mining industry. The player takes on the role of the protagonist, a veteran of the Venusian wars looking to carve out a new future for herself. She has enlisted to participate in an nine-year mission to work on a mining colony. When she wakes up from hypersleep she finds herself alone on the ship and with no memories. The player must then explore, investigate and find a way to get off the ship before the situation gets worse. Along the way, the protagonist will experience a series of traumatic events related to his personal life: visions, dreamlike recollections, strange noises and apparitions that mess with his head and make her question what is real and what is not. We have a script with a main plot and a linear emotive journey waiting for you, but this is just the beginning. If you go deep and investigate you'll see there ir more beneath the surface. Once you've played the first scenes of the game you'll be able of wandering the full ship, searching and exploring every single detail. The mystery of what is happening is the basis of the Lazarus gameplay, although the player is the one who gathers all the clues and details scattered throughout the ship to reach the conclusion. FEATURES · INMERSIVE STORYTELLING FULL OF MYSTERIES to unveil in a science fiction set up with a multi-level funcional script. · UNCOMPRESSED NARRATIVE where there is more than meets the eye and every detail is there for a reason. · A bunch of DIVERSE PUZZLES to solve.
