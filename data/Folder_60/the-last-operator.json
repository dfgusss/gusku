It's apparent that Monolioth Corp was behind the spread of the disease, but because of the disorder left from the billions of lives lost, governments and law enforcement are focusing on keeping order and supporting infrastructure instead of tracking down those responsible. The World Justice Organization has plans to use their limited resources to prove that Monolith was responsible and rally the international community to bring them down. Monolith's motives are unclear, but the series of events behind their plan will slowly come together. You are a PRO, a Primary Retrieval Operator, who will use your set of unique skills to infiltrate the areas of operation, locate the evidence and return it to be processed. Standing between you and your objectives is the MSF, Monolith Security Forces, whose sole purpose is to protect the interests of Monolith. It's time for the world to see what they did and how they did it. Libera iustitia. Gear up, PRO, and move out.",
