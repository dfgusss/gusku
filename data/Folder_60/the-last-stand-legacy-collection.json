    "About the game": "Featuring three classic titles with AI upscaled assets, The Last Stand Legacy Collection includes The Last Stand, The Last Stand 2, and The Last Stand: Union City, in one comprehensive package. The very first game in The Last Stand franchise- play as Jack in the opening days of the zombie apocalypse. Arm yourself with weapons and supplies in the daylight hours. Support your party of survivors by repairing your barricade. Defend your encampment from the onslaught of the undead when the sun goes down. Following the events of The Last Stand, Jack and the remaining survivors will carve a path to the coast before the evacuation leaves them behind. Reach Union City before the military fully quarantines the mainland in 40 days. Bait zombies towards the killing floor by placing traps each night as you fight for your life. Survive as long as you can as you scrounge for weapons and survivors in each city. In the last days before evacuation, you’ll navigate Union City , now overrun by the zombie scourge to find your partner and hopefully some safety for you both. Traverse Union City as your customized survivor. Become strong enough to prevail in the apocalypse by levelling up your skills to fit your playstyle. Take fate into your own hands and explore the city on your own terms. Fight off zombies using one of the dozens of unique weapons you'll find on the streets. The Last Stand Legacy Collection features a beautiful visual upgrade to compliment its original gameplay, including AI-upscaled assets, fullscreen support, cloud saving, and achievements. Plus, all of the premium content from Union City is included as part of this release at no extra charge.",
