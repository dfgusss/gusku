Centuries ago, magic ceased to exist and the few remnants of it are weak. The Masked Mage is one of the last magicians alive and sets out to find out where magic went all those years ago. On your journey you will explore a vast and ominous mountain, old temples and ancient forests, meet the native wildlife and make a new friend along the way. The Masked Mage is a story about friendship, mystery and of course magic. Features: Fully explorable open world adventure game Upgrades and collectibles Beautifully animated pixel art Atmospheric soundtrack A unique and inspiring story about friendship ------------------------------- Controller Information: Due to limitations with the engine, some controllers, for example 8bitdo gamepads, may not work properly. There is, unfortunately, nothing I can do about that. Should you have any trouble with your gamepad, maybe try another gamepad or use the keyboard. I apologize for the inconvenience.",
