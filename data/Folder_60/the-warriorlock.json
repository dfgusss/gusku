    "About the game": "Story Entranced into a deep dreamscape by the hallucinogenic spores of a mind-devouring alien creature, a young explorer is unwittingly recast a challenger in a realm of unconscious fantasy, where empowered with super-human abilities of might and magic, he must crawl a punishing gauntlet of dark entities and monsters to defeat the labyrinth of his captor's mind game—proving himself a champion morsel worthy of digestion. Features Comical story-driven RPG with punishing strategic turn-based combat. Animated custom battle system, with enemy bribe option, stat-driven turn order and Action-Point charging gauges for unleashing special attacks and talents. Choice of party members to customize and balance your own 4-character battle crew. Randomized loot &amp; spell drops—no two players will ever receive all the same items or skills. Rare enchanted items–rings, amulets and objects–that can be equipped to any party member class to channel powerful entities in battle. Immersive and extensive soundtrack. Created and developed by just a guy. Development The Warriorlock was created as a comically-inspired linear RPG, with a lighthearted picturebook-style presentation and original story. I developed the game by heavily customizing a simple ruby script engine to create a one-of-a-kind homebrew grind crawler, with a 6-core character stat system akin to the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons standard, a hybridized action/turn-based battle system, pre-rendered game paths, randomized treasure drops for nearly all items and spells, and a hand-tailored menu inventory system with detailed descriptions and bonus stat points for steady character progression.",
