    "About the game": "Paul was a normal boy. He lived a normal life and was happy. He had moved to a new city, and it was his first day in the new school. No. Paul was no normal boy... A normal boy is not like him. I strongly believe he has a problem. A big problem. Life's most difficult problem to deal with. Help him. Please. Think_ is an unconventional RPG with a rhythm-based combat system . Listen to Paul's story from a different point of view - his own . Features: A rhythm-based combat system with arrows... for some reason. Meta elements... idk why honestly. Plenty of easter eggs. Questionable design choices that you will dislike. Uncool characters that you will unquestionably hate... A final note: in this game nobody can die. I mean.. that is possible... if you apply yourself to it. But don't try to do it, bro. Don't even think_ about it ok?",
