    "About the game": "Time Break Chronicles is a fusion of classic JRPGs and modern Roguelites, with a planned cast of 100 playable classes to find and unlock. Build your team, customize their abilities, and venture into a procedurally generated adventure through space-time and beyond! Strategic JRPG-like Battle Gameplay A core element of any JRPG style game is turn-based combat. Time Break Chronicles features strategic turn-based battles, using our custom built engine, against a variety of foes, each requiring different approaches, skills, and maybe an item or two to bail you out. Take care; these enemies are no pushovers. Even the average foes will test your thinking and require a strong team to defeat! Explore, Adapt, Overcome Your adventure will not only consist of battles. You will also have to contend with a variety of traps, barriers, secrets, and other encounters as you explore the procedurally generated map. Customize your characters, their abilities, and choose the correct items to help you overcome obstacles. Customize Your Heroes Customize your heroes' abilities with a wide variety of equippable relics, that can do anything from modifying attributes to granting new skills. Craft additional relics to round out your strategy. Build a Town Even heroes need someplace to rest after a difficult journey. Build up a town over time with multiple buildings and varied upgrades to support your favorite strategies. Features 100 Playable Character Classes (by end of EA) - Heroes from all throughout history and even the future. Find and unlock them all! 6 Unique Stages (by end of EA) - Each stage contains unique enemies, items, encounters, and heroes to unlock. Roguelite Gameplay - Every stage playthrough is different, with random effects to give each run a unique feel and strategy. Customize Your Heroes - Equip relics and train skills to customize your hero's abilities and refine your strategy. Two Ways to Play - Build up your forces and town over time in Chronicle mode, or dive into the roguelike Singularity mode to challenge increasing difficulties. Endless Mode - Play any stage in an endless looping mode for increased difficulty and rewards, and to test your skills. Classic JRPG Styling - As fans of classic SNES-era JRPGs, we have tried to recreate the feel and fun of these classic games. Controller Support - Play with the mouse or keyboard, or use a controller for that classic feel!",
