    "About the game": "You are the last 4 survivors on your spacecraft! Do you have the teamwork required to complete your missions while traversing perilous space? Run into a room activate it, steering as you go to fight off enemies and protect your ship. Online and local coop means you can easily play with your friends no matter where they are. In this game you must make real time decisions and prioritise your efforts to help your team, fans of FTL / Lovers in Dangerous Spacetime / Galaxy Trucker / Space Cadets / Artemis will enjoy this! Play the whole campaign up to four player co-op seamlessly through Steam Mix and match local and online players together Fine tune your ship by customising the rooms Operate the onboard systems of your ship from laser guns to shields, holomedics, repair drones and missiles Encounter exciting new events throughout your missions; experience poisonous gas leaks, collecting escape pods, intruders on board and many more... Taking on roles is up to you do you want to put on the captains hat and lead the team, do you see yourself as a top pilot or just get on those guns and blast your way through! With so many ship layouts to choose from you can customise a ship to suit your play style and what you take will change how you and team play. Make the tough decision on how many rooms to dedicate to guns or defences or if you want the flexibility to deal with every situation, choosing what rooms to take and where they are on the ship is all up to you. It's a tough decision having to pick if you want to have a spaceship with good stats or use a ship with lots of slots to place modules or even have a ship with a convenient layout where it is easy to get between different locations. Play with your friends online is easy with Steam’s invite system, there is keyboard and controller support for multiple people playing on the same computer and best of all you can even mix and match both! We love gamepads but we know not everyone has one, if you fancy getting much closer to your friends everyone can play on the same keyboard. The whole campaign is designed to be played with your friends so any combination of keyboard, controllers and online play work. If you don’t have enough people for a full crew our super smart bots can fill in the missing slots, even allowing you to play everything single player if you fancy a real challenge! Each player receives skill points that purchase new modules that can be installed onto the ship. There is one huge tree of unlockable content so coordinating with your team to most efficiently cover the skill tree will benefit everyone. This vast circular skill tree allows you to specialise while still staying flexible. A crew member focusing on weapons might choose to change their path and develop expertise in shields while retaining their progress. Beam Lasers – Life in space can be mean, show them you can handle yourself with these hot hot lasers. Bridge – Every ship needs a captain, and every captain needs a comfy place to sit.There are plenty of different bridges to choose from, changing the stats of the ship, adding features or giving you other functionality. The captain is going to think they are the most important person, but really they are just pointing where to go and wearing the fanciest hat. Shields – Using shields will be critical, they block incoming attacks but break under heavy damage. There are various shield types, which can take more damage, cover a larger area, or recover faster, so choose wisely to survive for as long as possible. Holographic Medic – Space is dangerous, especially for a ragtag crew of loose-cannons who don’t play by the rules and injuries will happen, In the past we used to train humans to be doctors but this takes too long so why not get a computer to do it for you. Missiles – You know what's better than one missile? Lots of missiles! These weapons track down enemies and do damage in an area. However they take a long time to reload, which does give the bad guys time to wonder whether you might be over-compensating for something. Space Batteries – Not sure what space batteries are? They are like normal batteries but in space. Cloning Room – Why use medical assistance when we can just print you out a clone when you die? The most time consuming part is all the paperwork. Repair Droids – At some point someone’s going to scratch the paintwork on your spaceship, who’s going to go and fix it? Not me! Repair robots are cheap, disposable and you can turn the volume down when they start to complain. Shell Guns – These weapons will be your main way of attacking, they come in a variety of styles to suit your opponents. Some are more effective at destroying things at range, some are better at getting groups of enemies. We’ve found these to be far more effective than diplomatic negotiations. Warp Speed – Sometimes you just need to be somewhere else really, really quickly. I’m not running away! It’s a tactical decision. Energy Room – There are no hairdryers on this ship but too much has been plugged in. Dave down the corridor must have left all the laser guns on again, lucky we brought some batteries to help charge up the energy. He keeps doing this, someone really should tell him.
