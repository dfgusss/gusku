    "About the game": "Utopos is back! The original Utopos launched almost 30 years ago in 1993, but the magic is still there. Utopos is a MOSA - Multiplayer Online Space Arena. :) Utopos is easy to pick up and provides countless hours of fun action with your friends! It's a twin-stick shooter where you control 3 different weapons simultaneously, trying to get the most kills during an intense match. Situated at the Asteroid Belt, Utopos is a colonized world inhabited by humans who left the earth in the search of a better life. Rocketship fights have become a popular sport and it's up to you to fight your way to the top. Choose your ship and weapons and fight against other players to see how is the ultimate rocketship fighting champion! While Utopos is a multiplayer game, it also provides AI-controlled bots that fight just like humans, so you can train on your own too. Try Utopos with a friend - this is quite possibly the most fun you've had in ages!",
