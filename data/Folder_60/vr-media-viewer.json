We are paying close attention to the latest video playback technology so that we can play as many videos as possible, but there are unsupported files such as new formats born in real time and videos with very large file sizes. I would appreciate your understanding. If you are worried about playing your video files, we recommend that you try the demo version before purchasing. In addition, the subtitle data stored in the file is not supported. Please use the SRT file to display the subtitles. Also, it supports third-party decoders (LAV Filters etc.), so please try it if you can not play the video. (In that case, install the decoder yourself, then change the video API to DirectShow in the VR MEDIA VIEWER) About demo vertion We offer a free demo version that allows you to check whether your files can be displayed and played correctly. The demo version has a 5 minute usage limit, and there are no settings, favorites, or history retention after closing the application. Of course, those restrictions are removed in the product version. About support for Windows Mixed Reality Windows Mixed Reality headsets have been released by many companies and have not been marked for Windows Mixed Reality because they have not been confirmed to work on all models, but operated normally in environments using 'FMVHMD1 (Fujitsu)' and 'Windows Mixed Reality for SteamVR' (However, it does not support controller vibration).",
