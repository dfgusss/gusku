    "About the game": "Whimsical Quest is a retro action arcade adventure with roguelite elements. Traverse the whimsical world with a character that is destined to do hard work for apparently no reason. Unlock different characters along the way and upgrade your characters to be able to overcome the adventure that lies ahead. Prepare to fight against randomly spawning enemies in different terrains. Collect many different items to form your ultimate character that might die, just in case he doesn't. Jump into the game and immediately start your journey to defeat the enemies that lie in wait. Enrich your encampment to make them satisfied, in return you can bolster your powers. Try not to die until you can make an end to the mastermind behind spawning these beasts. In perfect retro fashion, you will not get your hand held through the entirety of your adventure. Over 50 items with different rarity to collect and utilize on your character each run. 5 different characters to unlock and play, including the Peasant, the Scholar, Spirit Blazer, Johntlet and Flockman. Hack computers with directional inputs that are fun fun fun. Fight through 6 different terrains with various subset maps within. Find critters to fight for you along your journey. They stay by your inside until you have met your own demise. A retro inspired soundtrack that has more than enough funky bleeps and bloops. New game + mode after completion. No manual.",
