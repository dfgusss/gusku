    "About the game": "YORG.io 3 is a unique combination of tower defense, zombies and strategy. Now with multiplayer and mods! This game is under active development! It is a finished and playable game, but I'm working on improving the game mechanics right now, since some people complained about it (Whereas others loved it). I also fixed a lot of day one issues which were the cause of the most negative reviews. Please note that this game is quite different compared to the original YORG.io! Build up your base and defend it against the zombies, which try to destroy it during the night. You need to place mines and factories to build supply chains which produce ammunition for your defensive towers. Research and upgrade every tower to unlock its special abilities and manage your factories to produce the optimal rate of resources! YORG.io 3 introduces entirely new content, featuring a lot of new buildings and unique enemies. Progressively unlock towers like the new laser tower, and get prepared for armored and invisible zombies, super hard bosses, map themes and much more! MULTIPLAYER That's right - YORG.io 3 now has multiplayer! Play with and against your friends and strangers in casual games. Build zombie factories to produce zombies and attack your opponent with it in the 1v1 and 2v2 match modes. And to make sure you don't get bored, there are now ranked games! Complete your placement matches and play ranked games to climb up the ladder and eventually reach the legendary master division! MODS YORG.io 3 now supports mods! Mods have access to the whole game and can add new buildings, enemies, mechanics, overlays and basically everything you can imagine! MAP LAYOUTS &amp; DIFFICULTIES Play on different map layouts which each feature an individual theme and power-ups, which grant global bonuses to all of your buildings. The medium and hard difficulties ensure you won't get bored! And if you're more of the constructor guy, theres still the sandbox mode which lets you freely experiment. ALL NEW CONTENT Get prepared for the zombies by using the special laser tower. Produce power using solar panels or the nuclear reactor. Upgrade your factories to produce better ammunition using coal, iron and uranium. Prepare your defenses for the mage zombie whose attacks spread over multiple buildings or the pulse zombie which disables your defenses. There is so much new content, I don't even know where to start! ACHIEVEMENTS Take the challenge and complete up to 42 achievements with several challenges in the single player to gain coins as a reward! SKINS Personalize your zombies and buildings with cool skins from the store! All skins can also be seen by your opponents in multiplayer. STANDALONE ADVANTAGES YORG.io 3 will simultaneously launch on the web - However, with very limited features and content. Get the Steam version here for the best experience! If you are unsure about the purchase, I recommend playing a while on the web version for free and see if you like it! PS: The Steam version is much cheaper than buying the content in the web version! TRANSFERRING YOUR ACCOUNT Also, if you want to transfer your savegames from the web version to the standalone, send a quick E-Mail to feedback@yorg.io with your web username and your standalone username, and I will transfer your savegames!",
