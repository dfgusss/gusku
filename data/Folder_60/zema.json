    "About the game": "Take a look at electronics from the inside. There are copper conductors, resistors, inductors, diodes and capacitors. This is a spherical maze. It is very easy to get lost. Let's get rid of all the foreign objects. Caution! High voltage! The game is a maze puzzle on a sphere. Each time you start, a new random map is generated. The player is guaranteed to be able to visit any corner of this labyrinth. Control is the arrow keys. There is always a way out, and this is 'Esc'.",
