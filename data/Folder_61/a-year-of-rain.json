    "About the game": "Story This world is a harsh and unforgiving place. Its people have to fight for every scrap. Tenacious tribes, nomadic clans or those huddled in the shadow of those with power... they're all caught in a cycle of war and violence, to wrestle from the land what little sustenance it provides. Two old friends want to break that cycle and create paradise amidst the desolation. A tempest of change is brewing on the horizon. Real-Time Strategy Choose one of three rival factions and get immersed in a gameplay mixture of base building, resource gathering, unit recruiting and battling against or alongside others players in campaign or skirmish modes. Structures and units can be upgraded in order to enhance efficiency and power. Conquer your enemies with your carefully assembled army led by a legendary hero! Team Play and Roles The ultimate Team RTS - play together across all game modes! Select from one of three roles to unlock special technologies and coordinate with your ally to determine your team’s strategy. Alternatively, you can always command your AI companion to deploy its troops according to your masterplan. Co-Op Campaign A Year Of Rain’s co-op campaign is designed with a team of two in mind. The epic story features a range of iconic characters and locations. During your journey you must strategize, survive ambushes, uncover secrets and wage war – always with the option to experience the story together with another player. Competitive Multiplayer The classic skirmish mode is being developed for competitive matches from the very start. Those new to the genre can use integrated build orders to get their bearings, while seasoned players will find detailed match statistics to further improve their game – easy to learn, hard to master! Factions and Heroes In the world of A Year Of Rain, three unique factions find themselves in a struggle for power. Each faction features three powerful heroes to spearhead your armies. House Rupah is led by an ambitious man from the northwest, called Jaidee Rupah. He is ready to claim unclaimed lands to make a name and a legacy. The Restless Regiment . Led by the infamous Lady Llorona, they all dance on her strings and either serve her in mindless obedience or zealous devotion fueled by singular, driving purpose or the torment of martial memories. The Wild Banners are a coalition of nomads, hunters, tribes, forgotten and fallen civilizations as well as lone wanderers. They chose not to belong where so called civilization thrives. They are beastly savages for some, and tenacious survivalists for others. Features The ultimate Team RTS. Play together across all game modes.
