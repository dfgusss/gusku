    "Release date": "Jul 5, 2019",
    "About the game": "The last kingdom of men has fallen. Nameless terrors wreak havoc across the land. There is but one who can restore peace and order to the Northern Realm. You, the Illuvitar, have been summoned to save mankind from certain doom. Hack, cast, and loose your way through an ancient saga, and become the hero of a world engulfed in death. Rescue captives, build up your defenses, strike back with blade, spell and bow against the forces of darkness. This is NOT your ordinary survival game.. be warned.. .. and tell the Necromancer.. we are always watching... ----------------------------- PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT TO READ BEFORE YOU BUY!!! Please try out the FREE Demo version of my game via the download link in our Discord's download section. This game is NOT very complete yet, and I would rather bring you the most value possible for your hard earned money. Please only consider purchasing this game once you have tried the demo and see the current progress so that you are not disappointed. There are MANY great features planned for this game that are not yet implemented, and I will be updating the demo version along-side the paid Steam version until such time that I feel the game is worth the asking price. This is my first title, and working solo it can sometimes take a little while between updates, but progress is always update in the discord daily if you are interested in following along and seeing what the game has to offer before purchase. Special thanks to those who have purchased and supported the game with testing, and feedback. Your help continues to not only be appreciate but invaluable to the progress of this game and you all have my deepest gratitude. You have made an otherwise impossible dream, actually possible. If you have purchased the game and would like to test, and/or provide feedback, please feel free to post in the Steam discussions or stop by the discord and share your thoughts, as I am always happy to give a free key or two out for those who help me by finding bugs or just giving feedback in general.
