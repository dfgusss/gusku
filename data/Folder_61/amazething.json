    "About the game": "Please be advised that this mixture of maze-running and relaxing beats might still cause your controller to get stuck in your screen. Trap filled mazes with an ever growing difficulty await to test your skills. Reach the goal to finish the levels - but keep in mind most levels will require you to collect all gems to escape. Touching the walls - or traps - will kill you, resetting all of your progress in the level. No checkpoints - these levels are meant to be completed in a single run. Don't worry though. Your ghosts will remind you of every deadly mistake you did. Race your golden best time ghost in each level and improve your skills. Amazething, isn't it?",
