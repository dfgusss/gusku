    "About the game": "Angry Squirrel - is the simplest platformer with surviving elements where you have to do the levels playing as a squirrel. One of the purposes in the game is collecting nuts. There are five nuts on every level. If you find them all, the entrance to the squirrel’s house will open, and you are on the next level. You have three lives. When you waste your lives, you’ll die. You’ll need to do the level again. Be careful and watch out various traps on your way. Think of your every movement because every step can be the last for you. Good luck!",
