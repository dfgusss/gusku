    "About the game": "Art Of Gravity is a voxel/physics based puzzle game, revolving around the theme of destroying abstract figures, which results in mesmerizing displays of dance of gravity. My name is Michal, a puzzle game designer - and it's my new game, after very well received Zenge. As a player - you will have to discover the rules of the game, as there are no tutorials or explanations, just you, the levels and puzzles. The game is packed with tons of different mechanics that will surprise you, give you a wonderful eye-catching physics experience, make you think, or just leave you in awe of oddly satisfying beauty of destruction. The game consists of over an hour of gameplay, with all the levels designed to surprise, enchant, and give you a fantastic puzzle game experience. Thanks for playing! Yours Michal aka Hamster On Coke",
