    "About the game": "Arwinia is a retro-style fantasy action platformer. Play as Trenton on a quest to find and bring a powerful wizard back from the shadows. As a ranger use your longsword, dagger, shortbow, and dexterity to navigate this perilous journey. Collect gold and experience to level up your character and equipment. Player skill will be tested navigating levels, dispatching enemies, defeating bosses, finding items, making wise purchases, and avoiding damage knockback in perilous locations. Play to completion, for highest score, fastest time, or achievements. Arwinia is a classic linear retro-style pattern-based game, featuring 8 and 16-bit mashups of classic style sprites and chiptune music mixed with modern elements. Game play is designed so that once mastered Arwinia can be completed in one sitting and speed run. Arwinia is retro-hard. Users who want a more casual experience can unlock an easier mode for playthrough by kneeling at the first tombstone.",
