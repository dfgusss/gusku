We made huge strides from last year and have even bigger plans for what we can accomplish next year. Your purchase and support of this game helps to make those plans a reality. We plan to release annual versions of the game with improvements to graphics, animations, features, and more! Let us know what you'd like to see in the game, and share Axis Football with your friends!",
