    "About the game": "Bonbon is a short, first-person domestic horror narrative in which you navigate childhood events beyond your capacity to understand. Bonbon is about experiencing the objects and events around you. As your parents increasingly demonstrate their absence, you spend time with Bonbon, a large, overbearing and ambiguous visitor... You can play with mouse and keyboard, or a 360-style gamepad. The game takes between 20 to 40 minutes to complete, depending on how you play.",
