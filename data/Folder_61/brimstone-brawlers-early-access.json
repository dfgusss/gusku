    "About the game": "Brimstone Brawlers is a local and online multiplayer pvp arena brawler with peculiar characters set within the Lovecraft inspired, gothic city of Brimstone. Choose from an initial cast of five Brawlers with unique abilities and playstyles including the bombastic explosive-maniac Bomber, a deranged Plague Doctor who thinks he is an actual bird, and the menacing Vampire just looking for love. If you upgrade to the Founder’s Edition you can unlock more Brawlers to play with! Set in a fantasy Lovecraftian industrial world, brawls occur in a variety of dangerous hazard-filled 3d arenas. Laugh in delight as you knock a friend off to their doom or scream in fear as you get hit by a runaway train! Play with up to four friends locally with controllers or play online with up to eight players through peer-to-peer connections. Play with your Steam friends or join our Discord to find new friends. Check out our Roadmap for planned updates to our Online play! Brawl against friends in a variety of different PvP modes including Free For All Deathmatch, Free For All Stock, Team Deathmatch and Team Stock. For a change of pace players can play the bonus mode Bamball, Brimstone’s take on football, where they can use their abilities to disrupt (or eliminate) their opponents before scoring the winning goal. Stellar industrial victorian soundtrack by Andy Gillion (solo artist, songwriter and lead guitarist of Mors Principium Est) provides the perfect atmosphere to brawl with friends.",
