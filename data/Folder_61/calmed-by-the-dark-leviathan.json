    "About the game": "More than 90% of humanity was killed by the Gods of Infinity, dragon beings who now rule the Earth, the last humans live in underground shelters. The remaining survivors are building their own weapon, a Dragon Slayer Mech, but in a wrecked world, such thing isn't a easy matter... So is up to Europa, Sofia, Claire and Virginia to defy the gods and save the world! Action combat; Fight, capture and upgrade giant monsters! Open World to explore; Gather resources and use it to repair things or trade with other shelters; Multiple endings and New Game+. This is a new timeline for Calmed by the Dark and, with it, new characters, lore and story will be introduced. Different from the main story or the Purgatorium mode, RE:iterate has a more linear and narrative focused experience with a combat inspired by older Beat'em up games. Brief story of RE:Iterate: Across the city, people are being mysteriously kidnapped and they are never seen again. Eve, the protagonist, was just looking for a job and somehow ended up discovering a strange world where she awakens her powers and learn the truth behind the kidnappings... Purgatorium: A game mode which the player must climb a tower full of monsters, for those wanting a more challenging and roguelike experience.",
