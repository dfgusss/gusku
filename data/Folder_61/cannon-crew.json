Feel free to get competitive within your team - the more gold you can snatch or jobs you complete will give you a higher score than the others - but don't get too distracted from the incoming horde! Game Modes - Story Mode - Survival - Puzzles Difficulty The difficulty changes depending on number of players in-game. If you're playing with a team of 4 then enemy waves will arrive quicker and be harder to defeat - Singleplayer means enemies will move slower and take less hits.
