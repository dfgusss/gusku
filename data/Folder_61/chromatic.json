    "About the game": "The world is monochrome. It is your quest to defeat those evil adversaries who have taken the color, and restore the world to its colorful state. In this 2D Side-Scroller, you will travel across four different levels, restoring color to the world as you progress. Jump, Dash, Grapple, and more in this colorful 2D adventure! Progression In Chromatic, you will fight multiple bosses, each releasing a new color when you defeat it. As you restore color to the world (and yourself), you will also discover new abilities to help you traverse difficult landscapes and give you an advantage against enemies. Features - Four unique levels containing varying landscapes, themes, obstacles, enemies, and bosses - Four special abilities unlocked with new colors - Themed music for each level - Color. Development This game was made across two semesters (15% of the game in the first semester, and 85% in the second). Warning: This game may not be for you if you have an avid fear of any of the following: water, color, vibrance, bunnies that pelt you with wooden pellets, giant two-dimensional frogs, music, clouds, wind, annoying lava chickens, falling, failing, running, dashing, jumping, moving, sand, people, or fun.",
