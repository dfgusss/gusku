But caution: don’t come to near otherwise the comet will crash onto the planet! Shoot the comet through galactic flows It may happen that galactic flows cross the path of your comet and it needs to fly through them. Forward planning is necessary: If the comet flies with their flow direction it gets faster, but if it flies against them it get’s pushed back and will be deviated. Caution, asteroids! Some things in space should better been curcuited – like asteroids. Prove your feel for timing and wait for a gap to pass the comet safely through the asteroid belt. Just space junk? On the journey through space you will come across human legacys, for example satellites.
