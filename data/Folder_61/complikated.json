    "About the game": "Retro, 90’s style rock’n diamonds with logic gates/binary puzzles. Fail to succeed. Dodge gravity balls. Collect items to unlock the exit. Use logic gates to solve puzzles. Something old The ecstatic pleasure of winning when you failed so many times in order to beat the challenge. The exasperation when the game gets the best of you when you’re least expecting. The kick-up from the ramping progression. The nostalgic 8 bit retro sound. Something new These tightly packed old-school levels add a new challenge: LOGIC GATES. Use logic operations (“AND”, “OR”, “NOR”, “XOR”, etc) presented in an accessible manner. Manipulate 19 functional tiles (signal generators, sensors, timers, delays, teleporters, etc). Avoid lurking viruses and over-zealous anti-malware Open laser barriers Turn off lethal electric arcs What others say about CompliKATed: “This is like a maze where the walls move in” - BasketMC on Mixer “This game is fast becoming my favorite non-horror game” - Shanon Gower on Youtube “There's a surprising amount of thinking involved in these tightly-packed levels” - Liam Dawe on gamingonlinux.com “That was insanely difficult […] but we did it! We beat the level!” - MagicManMo on Youtube",
