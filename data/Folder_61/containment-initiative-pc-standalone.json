    "About the game": "-Shoot zombies in the face and earn money! -Watch zombies heads explode in slow motion! -Split-screen co-op with another player on the same PC. -Unlock new weapons and equipment! Containment Initiative is a simple game about shooting zombies and earning money for doing it. As you earn money, you can buy better guns. Some levels allow you to roam around and collect supply crates that are traded in for cash, while other levels will have you perched up in a high position and allow you to shoot at zombies without worrying about them hitting you back. Once you call for extraction, you will need to survive for 60 seconds until the helicopter can arrive. If you die, you will lose any money earned in the mission! Currently, there are six maps to play through with each differing in difficulty. Split-Screen Co-op Info One player will need to use the keyboard and mouse and the other will need to use an Xbox controller.(Other controllers work just fine, but need to be recognized and setup in Steam before playing. Check the forum for directions on how to do this.) Online PC/VR Cross Play Deprecation Info Crossplay has been replaced by Steam's new Remote Play Together feature. The VR player would only need a single copy of Containment Initiative and can then stream the game to you(the PC player) in order to play the full game together. More info here:",
