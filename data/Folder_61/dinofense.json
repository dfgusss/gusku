    "About the game": "In DinoFense, you are a dinosaur protecting his/her Dinozens from an onslaught from the outside world. Using the VR Environment, players are required to strategize which enemies they should defeat first in order to make it to the end of each wave. Enemies will spawn all around you, and you must be alert of the entire VR environment. There are three main zones: Beach, Jungle, and Volcano. Each of which have their own variations and special items and enemies specific to that zone. DinoFense contains two game modes: Adventure and Endless. With Adventure mode, players can enjoy shorter length levels with preset difficulties. As the levels progress so does the difficulty, with more enemies and more waves before you win. Endless mode has no such respite. Players will face an endless barrage of enemies. Survival is key. By using the landscape and saving your captured dinozens, players are awarded power ups and a higher score. Get Ready, Wave is Starting! Looking for feedback for future patches!",
