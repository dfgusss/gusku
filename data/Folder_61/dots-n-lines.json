    "About the game": "Dots n Lines (Dots and Boxes) game is a classic and old school game brought you by Lighthouse Studio Europe. The game starts with an empty grid of dots. Usually two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. A player who completes the fourth side of a 1×1 box earns one point and takes another turn. (A point is typically recorded by placing a mark that identifies the player in the box, such as an initial.) The game ends when no more lines can be placed. The winner is the player with the most points. Features: - Single Player Mode (Against Computer) - Two Player Mode - Different grids (5x5, 6x6, etc.) - Very fun to play with your friend. - Nice graphics and sounds.",
