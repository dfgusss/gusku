    "About the game": "The next generation of spooky displays, created by the Spooky Genius! You’ve never seen anything like this before. Run Ecto Portal on any large screen (projectors are best) that you show to other people. It will display ghosts and ghouls that passers-by can interact with and fight.* Some features of Ecto Portal: - Display a ghost on any screen (but best on large screens or projectors). - Select from different ghosts. - Change the size of the ghost. - Rotate the ghost to best fit the display area. - Download new ghosts as they become available. - Ghosts move around, haunting your display area when in idle (haunt) mode. - Display your ghost on a map so trick-or-treaters, ghosthunters and others can find it. - Allow EctoQuest players to fight and attempt to capture your ghost. ** Interactive features require Internet connection.",
