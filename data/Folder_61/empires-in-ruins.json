Tower defense-based combat - fight your battles in a new, advanced tower defense style that winks at advanced real time strategy Dark humor, dark humor everywhere! - Don't smile, it's punishable.

A god forgotten borderland, the Western Marches, just got inflamed with rebellion, cutting every contact with the capital and declaring independence. And in such a critical moment, who to send in order to quell the rebellion if not a grumpy alcoholic sergeant with discipline problems and bad bad temper? Why him?
