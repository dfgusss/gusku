    "About the game": "Flood Fill is a fast paced action-arcade game. The concept is easy, the game is not. Avoid the enemies, and section off areas of the map. Section off enough of the map, advance to the next level. Different levels offer different challenges, some will require precise movement, some a bit of patience, other levels will be fast paced, and some may require a bit of thinking. Complete the game, and be rewarded with end game content that might hold challenges of it's own.",
