    "About the game": "In Ghost Buster 3D, you are a ghost that hunts down other ghosts and gather their energy to survive. There is a present ghost epidemic, ghosts have taken over several residences and you've been called upon to do the job no one has been able to do, that is eliminate all ghosts you see occupying the residences. Since these are ghosts, no normal weapon will have an effect on them. You do have a weapon that zaps ghosts, a ghost zapper which is basically an EMP device modified by you to zap ghosts. While it all looks good, the zapper has a kink though. It draws on your energy when fired. This means that you can't go out there with a guns blazing mentality in mind. You have to be frugal in your use of the ghost zapper. So technically, you can kill yourself if you overuse your zapper. The good news is, on successfully zapping a ghost, your health is restored back to full levels. Also you have a map that is your guide to tracking down these dastardly ghosts, use it well, make sure you keep your distance when hunting these ghosts, they draw on your health when you get too close to them, even behind walls where you can't see. Mastery of your map is essential to your survival in this third person shooter. As a ghost, you possess the ability to walk through walls in your bid to hunt down ghosts, though this process will draw on your health and is not advised. We have identified three ghost types out there, the reds are the malevolent types, attacking when you get within range, the yellows which cause difficulty with your lights and the blues which teleport you to other areas where you may meet the more malevolent types. The different ghost types are outlined on your map so be careful out there.",
