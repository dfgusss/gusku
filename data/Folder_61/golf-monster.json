    "About the game": "GOLF MONSTER - is a 2D puzzle where you have to do the levels playing golf. You are playing as a cute monster who likes scoring balls into the holes. At first sight, it seems so easy to play but it’s not true. Every level is unique and unrepeatable. You have to have a perfect strike power and be accurate. Again, don’t think it isn’t hard – you have to strike straight or kick a ball stronger. Besides, you have to think and use enemies and traps for successful game. Your enemies are monsters who don’t want balls being in the holes. For your information, monsters are slightly dull. They help you to do the level. All you have to do is to be wiser and use them in your own way. Please, remember about finding a crystal and kick the ball using limited strikes. Can you do all levels? It’s up to you. Good luck!",
