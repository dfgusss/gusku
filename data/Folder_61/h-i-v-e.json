But make sure to take care of them, if a clone dies in action you will lose it for ever and all the chips that it was carrying. Every run has randomized levels that will become larger and more challenging as you progress, choose your path wisely. Face different game modes in every level experiencing diferent roles when it comes to attacking or defending. The clones will act on their own once the enemies start arriving but you will be in charge of their placement and choosing the strategy they will follow. Remember your first revolution may fail. Learn from your mistakes, save money to buy permanent upgrades and in the end the H.I.V.E. will succed.",
