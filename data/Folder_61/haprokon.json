    "About the game": "Haprokon - the little more complex economy simulation Manage an imaginary city. You will not be able to see the city itself, but a lot of numbers that represent it. Stay on top of things. Ha ndel (= Trade) : Buy desperately needed goods or sell the ones that would otherwise make Your storage burst. Pro duktion (= Production) : Produce all 227 goods on plantations, farms, in mines and factories. Kon sum (= Consumption) : Build houses for Your population and watch, as Your people consume Your goods and becomes happier - And happy people pay more money! --- Once Your people are happy, You can upgrade them to the next of the 25 different population levels. And with a growing population You will unlock more and more buildings and with them Your people will demand more consumption goods. During the game an increasing number of resources will be unlocked - and their deposits will have to be found on expeditions. The more You progress in the game, the more challenge ranks will be unlocked that earn You technology points. These technology points can be invested to make progression easier. For example larger storages! There are 199 achievements in the game and 100 achievements in Steam. Can You unlock them all? Each new game can be adjusted to change the experience with every city You play. --- Warning, fat spoiler ahead! Can You build a huge metropolis without going bankrupt? --- Everything is drawn by hand. With love. Or something like that 'But dude, why is this sooo ugly?' I would call it art... but well. --- Please note: There is no pretty 3d graphics here. But a lot to manage! You like the challenge? Then welcome to Haprokon ;) Thank You for supporting indi-developers :)",
