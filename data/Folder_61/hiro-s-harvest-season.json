    "About the game": "Lola and Benny Hiro are two bunnies that can scare away foxes, wolves and bears. The Harvest Season is on. Choose your favorite bunny and protect your mate while gathering carrots and cabbages from the garden. Don't waste rotten vegetables but throw these against the predators to make them run away terrified. Make a good use of your ammo to turn the hedgehog's needles blast into your advantage. Keep your eyes on the rascal eagle and get bags full of gold coins with the cost of just a couple of well aimed blows. Three game types to enjoy: - Training Mode, with unlimited ammo; - Story Mode, with limited ammo and a set of incoming predators waves that are always the same. - Survival Mode, ultimate challenge - try to reach highest wave and be the leader on world wide leader board, with limited ammo and predators that become more and more challenging each wave. You can use several power-ups: - Throw stinky cabbage to scare more predators at once; - Put on the magic hat that speeds you up to harvest faster and defeat predators easier, limited duration per use; - Make martial move as last resort to scare all close-up predators with one terrific blow.",
