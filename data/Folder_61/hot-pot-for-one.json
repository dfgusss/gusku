    "About the game": "Overview Hot Pot For One is a short first-person experience about the bittersweet feeling of making hot pot at home for yourself on Christmas Eve. It is about the bitterness of lonely times, and the sweet comfort of food that keeps us going. We wish to evoke those emotions through simple and smooth interactions such as putting ingredients into the pot, watching them cook, seeing them being eaten, and eventually dumping the rest away. Our Story The concept of the game came from our personal experiences as international students. One of the most challenging things about living in a foreign country is that you are far away from your family and friends. And that can be very lonely. Luckily, one thing that can put our minds at ease in those times of difficulty has been to make and eat food from home. The familiar taste of hometown summons happy memories, and warms our hearts. It helps us retain our power to fight on. Those experiences inspired us to take this opportunity to express the loneliness of being away from home, as well as the satisfaction of consuming our favorite food, in the form of a game. What To Expect -Estimated playtime: 15~30min -a carefully-crafted, bittersweet story -Realistic looking food and high fidelity kitchen environment -more than 30 pieces of hand-drawn illustrations to be collected for multiple playthroughs -10+ kind of food models, with cooking and eating animations -physics based first person mouse look with no movement -high quality sound effects and music",
