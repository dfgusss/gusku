    "About the game": "You are a great tentacled cosmic deity, drifting through the endless void. Space can be very boring at times. But every now and then you find something that can hold your attention. This time, you found Earth. Build your Human Factory. Build a habitat, populate it with Humans and then butcher them into many parts for profit. Keep them fed and happy and they will work for you to craft items and power your machines. Automate everything with Pipes, Conveyors and Wall Flippers. Raise and Breed your Humans. Breed or clone Humans and separate them by Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence and Charisma. Complete quests for other great cosmic space deities and unlock new technologies. Expand your factory line to get the most out of each and every Human. Butcher Humans and sell their Souls. Process and export the Human parts for profit. Make clothes from their Hair and Skin, make drugs from their Hearts and Livers, make sausages from their flesh and Intestines, put their brains in a jar and sell their dreams for eternity, bottle and sell pure joy and pure horror, breed and sell high quality Humans whole. Question the very nature of morality and Human existence. Automate everything.",
