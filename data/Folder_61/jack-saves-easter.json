    "About the game": "Jack Saves Easter is a family friendly game where you play the role of Jack the Rabbit from Easter Island. As Jack, You will go on the adventure of a lifetime to recover various Essence Shards from challenging locations. Use your skills and wits to solve the puzzles and clues that will help you recover the essence and save Easter for All ! Jack Saves Easter is a 3d Platformer game that also has elements of an RPG with regard to interactive dialogue and missions. In order to access some locations in the game you will have to navigate over floating island platforms, stone stairs, deep water caverns, bouncy clouds and narrow walkways. You may have to use your Double Jump to break loot crates or to knock back enemies. You will also have to collect various items that are required by NPC's who will reward you with healing soups and powerful 'Y' Stick Sling Shots ! You will use these items to further explore and unlock puzzles. Some areas are only revealed by delivering items and objects to their correct locations or by arranging things to complete a pattern. Before leaving Easter Island make sure you talk to the NPC's and collect helpful items that will aide you on your quest. Also be sure to complete your special agent training. This will help you learn how to climb, double jump, target enemies and move items around the levels. Jack Saves Easter is a collaborative game from the creative minds of Emsad Brushbeard and T.C. Mabe (Hilltop Games LLC). Jack Saves Easter is the first game in a franchise series of games. Hilltop Games LLC is also working on Jack Saves Halloween, Jack Saves Christmas and other “Jack Saves” titles. Thank you for your support and for checking out Jack Saves Easter ! This game will be available on various outlets very soon.",
