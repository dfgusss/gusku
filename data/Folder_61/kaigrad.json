    "About the game": "What if there was no Sun? If you had to fight not only with others, but with the universe itself for the crumbs of light? The darkness is near. In such circumstances, a person's values are overturned. People stop being people. There was only a slim chance to fix it. But the path is thorny. And only you can choose the road! 'Kaigrad' is a non-linear visual novel in the genre of dark fantasy. The action takes place in the world of 'Kaigrad', where Light comes only from people, animals and all living things. He is on the verge of total darkness. People are distraught and seize every opportunity to prolong their miserable existence, forgetting about principles and morals. You have to find out what happened here, who is to blame for this and try to fix it! At the moment, the game has three main branches of passage, each of which has several endings. We are planning at least two more DLCs, which will have no less variability than the main part of the game. A story that will stay in your memory for a long time The oppressive atmosphere of a dying world Non-linearity is not in words, but in deeds Characters you don't want to end a conversation with A love line that leaves a pleasant aftertaste Great soundtracks As well as unanswered questions and... answers without questions.",
