    "About the game": "The King is tired of being protected so now he is shooting the enemies down! King Bullseye is a shoot-the-target game in which the enemies are chess pieces on the board! Can you think quickly to predict who you need to destroy first? Eliminate the enemies before they reach the King! Enemies make a move per 'turn'. Harder enemies make two or three steps per 'turn'. Headshots increase your score multiplier up to 10x! Miss shots or shots to the body decrease your multiplier! At the end of each wave you'll receive a bonus score for time and shields remaining. Leaderboard: Fight for the highscore. (Steam Integration) Achievements: 26 achievements to conquer. (Steam Integration) Light Gun Support: Light Gun is supported via the absolute mouse coordinates, you'll need to activate it on the pause menu! Mouse Sensitivity: Configurable via the pause menu Never Dies Mode: Keep playing even if you lose. Your score will stop increasing but you can keep training! Waves: 3 waves that mix different enemies with their patterns and difficulty. Straight to Action: No running around with lots of texts or customizations that take hours. Just enjoy a single-player campaign full of action and challenge! Play-Only Controller Support: You can use a controller to move the crosshair and shoot, but the pause menu needs a mouse. (It might be too difficult on the controller though) Steam Cloud Integration",
