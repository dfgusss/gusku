    "About the game": "Lawyer Guy is a jumping, shooting action platformer game in the vein of Mega Man™. There's no gimmicks, just high-quality level design and crushing old-school difficulty, with some modern quality-of-life touches. If you don't usually play very difficult games, this is a good place to start. Plus: a delightful demoscene/tracker soundtrack from some of the genre's most eminent musicians! It is also a role-playing game, because you play the role of Lawyer Guy. Free, to keep, forever, no strings attached. This game is a weird passion project and I want to make it available to as many people as possible. Therefore, it is free. Later on, there will be a 'Deluxe Edition' available to purchase with a small amount of bonus content. Features Multiple levels. To compare, a game like Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas™ only has one level No shaders: absolutely no shaders. None. The motion captured performance of Tom Hanks Probably the only video game about a lawyer ever made. Portable checkpoints, so you can enjoy a checkpoint at home or on the go. Canon Gay The second ever strand type game A ranking system Not roguelike Doesn't cost any money even though I spent years making it. The Dark Souls® Testimonials 'This game is too difficult' -my friends 'How's that Lawyer Man game you're working on?' -my family 'Lawyer Guy should have a katana made from nippon steel folded over 4000 times' -internet anime reviewer Lawyer Guy needs YOU! If you have opinions about this game, head over to my website (link is -&gt; thataway), where you'll find playtester feedback forms and contact information. I'll also be monitoring the forum here on Steam. If you can record or livestream yourself playing the game, even better!",
