    "About the game": "The Lobster Game is a ruthless competition in the pursuit of profit, which never ends in favor of the player. This is a kind of trap for city dwellers who are hungry for easy money and have paid for it with their own lives. And you're one of those poor devils. You have one task - to survive, and to do it for the sake of money or for the sake of life itself, it's up to you. Lobster Game is a reaction speed game, a chain of puzzles and QTE mini-games in which you need to apply all your talents, both obvious and hidden. There is no reward for victory here, the outcome is always the same - your death. But believe me, you will run this game again and again and again, hoping for a reward. After all, who knows, maybe this madness has an edge? Features of the game: - Cyclicity - Nice graphics - Non-trivial puzzles - Checking your reaction",
