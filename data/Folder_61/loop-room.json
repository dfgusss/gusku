Also, experience new fun in a different way from map to map. - Escape : You can escape after operating the panel with a key card that you can get around the room. You can guess the location from the compass displayed on the screen. - Two kinds of ghosts : each map with a ghost that moves randomly once every time you move the room. It consists of ghosts that keep wandering around the map looking for you. - Protection : Items you can get from moving around the room can be used before moving to another room to protect you. The only way to escape from a ghost wandering the map is to hide.",
