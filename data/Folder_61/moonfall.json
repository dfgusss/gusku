    "About the game": "Mixing elements from roguelites and turn-based tactical RPGs , Moonfall is a short game about travelling through dangerous wastelands. Manage your squad, recruit new travellers and craft items to reach the Valley where the broken fragments of the Moon once fell. Features: 6 different classes of travellers with unique abilities. Assemble the most versatile team to survive the dangers of the wastelands. Reorganize your team each turn and make the best use of the various terrain types. Avoid hazards and gather resources to craft makeshift equipment at your Night Camp. Procedural map and level generation: each run will offer a new set of situations and challenges. Origin cities, crafting recipes and codex pages to uncover and collect for the next runs. Moonfall is designed to take 2h-5h to complete depending on your experience with the same kind of games. I hope you will enjoy the game :)",
