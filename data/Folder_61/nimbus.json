    "About the game": "Nimbus is a unique combination of racing & puzzling. The player controls a craft with no means of directly propelling itself and needs to use whatever is scattered around the levels to acquire thrust and reach the goal. Traverse a world map with several distinct islands in order to recover your lost love. Light on story, but heavy on gameplay Nimbus offers several hours of increasingly harder challenges. Key features: Over 50 levels available on the main campaign Unique game play that is easy to understand, but hard to master A varied blend of levels that requires a combination of skill & puzzle solving Plenty of opportunity for optimizing how you approach each level in order to beat the best times Several trails, levels and ships to unlock Loads of secrets & tricks",
