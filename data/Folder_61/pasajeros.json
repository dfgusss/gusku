    "About the game": "Pasajeros is a narrative video game that mixes visual novel elements to tell the story of a taxi driver who tries to prevent the suicide of one of his passengers, in Chapinero, a neighborhood in Bogotá, Colombia. But in reality it is much more than that, it is a game of micro stories that take place over four nights that mix everyday stories with fantastic ones, showing everything from robots and vampires to musicians and thugs. It is an interactive game in which players can vary the decisions of its protagonists and determine the life or death, love or loneliness, of the taxi driver. It is a game with a duration of two to three hours, which aims to be a tribute to the most important cultural neighborhood in Colombia and rescue some of its myths through anonymous characters on the verge of happiness and death.",
