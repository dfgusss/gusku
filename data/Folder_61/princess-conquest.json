    "About the game": "Princess &amp; Conquest is a hybrid RPG game where you, the Knight, will have to decide the fortunes of a Kingdom, plunged into chaos after a certain 'incident'! The sudden disappearance of a powerful dragon is the spring for a series of events that will plunge the whole Kingdom into chaos! Now it's up to you to either keep everyone in check and save the land or plunge the Kingdom into a pit of insanity. The Kingdom is the huge world you will be adventuring in, with more than 400 different maps and everything a RPG needs: cities, hidden dungeons, secret events laying around, and a lot(!) of NPCs! The final version of the game will have 20 Reigns (currently working on the 15th) fighting for supremacy, each one of them led by a Princess of a different race or with some unique features! There's currently more than 100000 possible looks for our characters, across 20+ different races! There's pregnancies in Princess &amp; Conquest , but that's not the only way to get more companions! You can also: find eggs laying around buy new companions from the goblins auctions conjure skeletons resurrect undeads into other living races transform everyone into rabbits and many more! While every Reign is granted to get theirs, many characters that you'll meet around the Kingdom are missing their own lineage of NPCs (called Progeny) and can't be bred yet, but we'll keep adding more as development continues! VN meets RPG meets Strategy in a world to travel on foot, boat, digging your way underground, diving or flying with wings on your back. A surprisingly phenomenal soundtrack! You will be humming our tunes for weeks... More than 100k possible looks for NPCs you can recruit and 'have fun' with. Beautiful CGs and pixel animations made by professionals in the hentai industry. Countless dialogues, scenes, events exploring the Kingdom's characters and its story. Unique mechanics (simulated pregnancies and genetics, breeding, slave auctions, necromancy, kingdom-wide corruption, transformations...) Constant updates and plenty more features to come! Thanks for supporting our project! We hope to give you hours and hours of fun!",
