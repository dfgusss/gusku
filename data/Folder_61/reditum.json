    "About the game": "Forget everything you know. This place is a very different place. You are in a simulation. Although you are able to go anywhere you want, you can't actually go. REDITUM is a short first-person puzzle platforming game. You can change the gravity. You can walk the walls. You can swap the boxes. You have to solve puzzles and pass levels. Walls: If you press (E) to a wall, you rotate the simulation. Boxes: There are 2 kinds of boxes. On the arrow, they fall on the wall they show. You can open the doors by moving them. Empty boxes are not affected by gravity. You have to use them to overcome obstacles. Lasers: You can reflect the lasers by placing the Reflectors in appropriate places. You must carry the power and open the doors. Portal: You must activate the portal by finding the Pieces of Power in the simulation. Thanks for the music: Abstraction Music",
