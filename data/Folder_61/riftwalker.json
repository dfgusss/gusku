    "About the game": "Riftwalker is a rogue-like tower defense in a world consumed by darkness, featuring rich backstory and endless, detailed procedural levels. You play the role of a riftwalker in a scouting party sent to investigate a nearby missing star, but find more than you were expecting - a civilization, or rather, what's left of it. It's your job to find out what happened and make sure the threat never spreads to your world. Features Tower Defense like you've never seen before! Riftwalker takes the ambitious aim to redefine the genre. Rich procedural maps that develop as you progress through the game. A deep backstory that begs to be pieced together, delivered in bite-sized fragments.* Stunning visuals, that break free of the traditional mold surrounding tower defense games. Full 3D camera control, get close to the action with full 3D camera controls, allowing you to really be a part of the action. A large upgrade tree that you build as you play the game, allowing your towers to follow your playstyle.* Incredible music track that really helps immerse the player in the world of Riftwalker. * Early access notes, some features will become available post-release and are subject to change. I'm being open with the community as I don't want to disappoint anyone. The story is almost complete, however, I will only be introducing the story fragments once I've polished up the game-play some more and released the upgrade tree as they will integrate with the upgrade tree. In the meantime, there are clues to the story everywhere - without going into specific detail. The environment is being designed with the story in mind. I hope you decide to be a part of the community and help shape the future of this incredible game.",
