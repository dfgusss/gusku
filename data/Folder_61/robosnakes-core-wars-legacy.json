    "About the game": "RoboSnakes: Core Wars Legacy is a game created from dreams of a game, where your mechanical skill, age, dexterity or equipment won’t give you any major advantage, a game where nothing but your intellect could give you an edge on your opponent, player and AI alike. The effect of those dreams is a game with a completely new idea of the word multiplayer . You will never need to queue up and wait for other people since the players of RoboSnakes leave their mark on the game forever. What are Core Wars and why the name Core Wars Legacy? During prehistoric times, or 1984 to be exact, when no one even dreamed about a serious video game market an idea was born. An idea that fascinated us and inspired us.
