    "Name": "Space Cruise",
    "Release date": "Jan 17, 2019",
    "About the game": "With some recommendations and advice from top industry developers such as the midlands based Sumo Digital and Matmi , the game promises to blossom into a fun game that can be played both casually and for speed running. Space Cruise is a hybrid of both metroidvania style platforming and traditional bullet-hell gameplay, allowing the player to choose which play style resonates with them most for each run. With power-ups for both methods of gameplay, randomised levels on the branching paths, and leaving the final decision to the player, each run should feel unique! Test your runs across each level and compete for the fastest in the world, or take it slow, explore and find hidden secrets! It may be our first game, but with the bare-bones prototype impressing devs, with more polish and support coming to the game after launch while we move onto our most ambitious project; Space Cruise is a great example of what you can accomplish even with just two friends and some dedication.",
