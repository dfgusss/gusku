    "About the game": "Star Aegis is a shoot'em up without shooting. Use your shields to reflect bullets. Wave-based, scorechasing old school arcade experience. Your shields are powerful but limited. You need to defend and reflect from one side while tactically dodge from the other. Choose between ramming enemy ships with your shield for a smaller score or go for broke by reflecting bullets back at them. Main graphics, programming and all of audio made by one developer, one-man band style (hope you like guitars). A short but intense experience. I tried capturing the experience of playing a couple of rounds at the arcade before going to school. How high can you score? How long can you endure as the last line of defense?",
