    "About the game": "SUPER NEAT CAT is a retro platformer in the vein of the original Nintendo &amp; Super Nintendo 2D platforming games. Can this neat little cat save their home from a Nanobot-Virus? This virus was created by an ancient civilization. It has infected the world and has been taking over the wildlife. Their first time leaving their home, this cat will travel far to try and find the source of this destruction. 60+ levels await to be challenged and more! Run and double-jump across a land covered by ancient temples that have awaken again. These temples are protected with traps and hazards that you must avoid. Some form into shifting dungeons that change every time you enter! Absorb Nano-Crystals that seem to give the Nanobots power. Perhaps they can also be used to stop them! Can this neat little cat do more than they ever thought they could? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPER: - This is my very first 'big' game, and I made it in 10 months. - I have been learning game development for almost 2 years as a hobby. - I'm a full-time English teacher in Korea. In my free time I worked on this game. - I greatly enjoyed making this game while also learning to code and do game design for the first time! Thanks so much for trying my game. - I hope this simple game gives you some joy and fun challenge. Be safe and be happy! Neat Games :D",
