    "About the game": "Welcome to the Symbol Games Horror Bundle! This features four different games of varying types, ranging from exploration, questioning, modern store tasks, and making games with issues to fix. These games can and will pull out-of-game scares (that won't actually damage your system). (WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS IF YOU ARE SUICIDAL, AS SOME OF THESE GAMES CAN HAVE SUICIDAL THOUGHTS OR ACTIONS OCCUR WITHIN THEM.) These games are all a part of the psychological horror genre, as they do not feature many jumpscares, but they still have the right amount of tension. You play as a man, a man who lives throughout his life doing what he has to, in order to 'survive' in the world. There is another man too in a certain game, but that's just for a different experience... I promise. As you play these games, there are different events that can occur, such as intentional bugs or even 'repetitive' main menu screens, but that's where the fun just begins. The following games are included: - The Error Development - Perception_ERROR - Retail Retribution - The Big Day With features such as, but not limited to... - A story that may be hard to follow at first, but can be pieced together through replays of all games included! - a̷̺̹͈͓̖̖̞͍͚̮͖͗͗̓̊̿́́̾͛̕͘ ̵̡̼͉͓̼͠s̷̰̣͚͈͕͔̄̎̊̊̊̕͜͝t̷͈̭̉͠ǫ̵̩͉̬͈̀̑̎̀̃̊̉̚͠r̷̟̆͐̒̑̆̈́̔y̴͖̣̮͖̲̞͛ ̷̤̯͉̥͐̾̈́̉ő̷̧͈̠̙̲͍͂̃f̷̨̞̝͖͓̼͓̪͉̃̋̇̄͑̆̇͒̌͛̚͜ ̴̨͎͔̫͚̈́̐̈ş̵̧̢̢̛͍̹̰̋̏̐͑ͅo̴̹͗́̆̎̐m̶̯̫͓̘̺͐̈e̸͉̠̰̐̌͊̏t̷̨̨̛̻͚̪̟̋͂́̕h̷̛͔̪̜̬̫͓̖̜͎̳̐͆̏͆i̷̝̎̋̾͝n̷̙̪͙̦͖̄̋̎͝g̷͇͋͘͜ ̵̧̺̞͈̮̓̉̿̃̏̌̊̓̚ț̶͑̉̓͛̋̒̎ḧ̵̬̖̟̘́̅͛̆̃̿̄̍͘ḁ̸̡̛͙̮̫̜̬̠͒͆̾̂͂̓̕͠͠ͅt̴͈̹̘̮̖͎͕͊̅͆͠ ̷̛̜̓͗̆̈c̶̹̰͈̓̒̂̈́̈̓̑̽o̶͉̫̒́̓͜m̵̱͎͇̤̥̫̆͗͆̇͛́̍̎̊̚ë̶̡̤̠̻̼̫̮̗͍̾͠ş̶̧̛̳̟̫̬̖̘̲͈̰͑͛̇͌̀ ̵̼̯̭̠͊f̸̧̪̝̞̗̦͖̻̝̮͎̒̍̈́͐̕͘o̵̡͎̠̯̤̥͈̩͆̊̓͠r̴̼̹͙̼̜̮̫̬̬͇̍̓̂̏̃̏͐͌̇̀͘͜ ̵̡̧̖͚̖̫̘͇̘̓̾͊̋͋̾͠t̷̨̡̢̡͖̦̤̥͖̆̎̾̌͛͝h̸͇́̽è̶̬̼͛̾͆͊ ̴̯̱̠̜̮̓̌ͅë̷̯̺̺̊̈́̾̔͋̃̕n̵͎͆̒̉t̸̮̙̗̙̖͚̅̀̓i̵̥̗̖͈̼͇͉̳̩̹̠̍̋r̷̡̛̰̝͚̳̠̭̪̬̱͓͛͌̓̊͐͘͝e̷̮͍͙͐̌̎̾̕ ̸̢̢̦͚̞̪̗͕̉͋̃̇ẉ̶̢͎̒̽̓̿̄̕̚͝o̵̥͈̝̩͛̈́͘r̵̯͉̰̍̔̒͂̍̇́̀̚͜l̷͈͔̀͗̒̐̌̀̈́͌̍͘d̸̰̼̻̖̃̏͝ ̷̠̮̱̪͇̦̈̄̀̀͋͐̃̾͆̅͠ͅw̴͖̪̯̓i̸̢̨̡̺͎͎͉̲̦̹̔̀̑̈̋̓̔̓̕̕͝t̶͚̿̅͊h̵̢̯̗͙̙̻̺́̎̂̃͌́̑̕͠ͅí̶̛̟͑́͗̀́̑̋ͅͅn̸̪̻͎̂̑̅̾͊̎̚ ̸̺̈̿̔͒͒̈́̎͗͜ḧ̴̭͈͍̮͓͐e̶̛̙̦͈̯͇̊̽r̵̫̲̪̝̲̗̣̥͜͠e̶̢͕͙͈̲̝̝̤͛̉̚.̴̧̧̝͖̟̹̘̻͎̏̾̚͜ͅ.̸̨̻̗̬͍̬͇̥̣́̂͆̍̒́̊͂͝͝.̸̮̼̦͕̣̫̈̀̎͛̃̑̊͜ ̵̣̀̀͊̾̂̊͗̾̒͘b̴̳͙͉̜͚̘̮̂͘e̷̡̖̙͋̑̂̉̈́̇̎́ ̸̢̡͍̩̩̉p̶̨̖̩̻̝͚̞͙̯̖̉͗́̅̐͂̇͜å̵̡̡̧͙̖͖̰̼̫̲͍̉t̷̨̙̯̩̹̘̑ī̸̲̣̘̭̪̲͛̋̇̀̂͗͜͠e̴̫͗̓͊̊̔͊͆̚͝͝͝n̶̲̍̔̅̄t̷̡̘̯̝̣͕̓̑̏̌̌̐̄̅͋̈́͘͜ ̸͓̩̙͛͝f̶̣̖̖̹̟̝̯̯̬̫́̔̚͝͠͠͝ͅố̷̢̎̽̈͗̊̃r̴̡̢͖̱̙͉̝̐́̐͗̉͊͠͝ ̶͇͛̽͐̏̊̆̿̏͜͝n̴̨͓͕͈͍̬̮̘̙̭̄̒̾͛̇̆͑͑͊̑̓ǫ̴̢̫̹̰̥̦̦̞̖̪͛́̐̈͝w̸̨̫̰͇̽̏͘͘͝͠.̵̤̀͌̅́͂̌̑̚͝ - A bunch of secrets scattered around, ranging from in and outside of the games! - Creative scares that involve breaking the fourth wall.

(There are a LOT of secrets and other things that you can find if you keep playing...) TO RESET ANY OF THESE GAMES, GO TO %AppData%. From there, go to LocalLow, and then find the folder called 'Symbol Games', once you're in there choose any of the games you want to reset in their respected folders, and delete all files that aren't in a folder (Example: Important Saves). I hope you enjoy these games that are included in this bundle, as they have more meaning than what you may think, do not let the graphics fool you.",
