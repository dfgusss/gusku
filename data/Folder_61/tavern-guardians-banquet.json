    "About the game": "Welcome to an all new RPG experience which perfectly blends the excitement of match three games with the strategic demands of Turn Based Tactics! No longer will you match tiles just to watch avatars attack enemies above the board. In Tavern Guardians: Banquet, countless waves of enemies, each with their own skills and specialties, advance from the top of the board. You take on the role of a Guardian, charged with defending various taverns. Watch each enemies' movements and actions, and then use magical skills and items to claim victory against evil! 60+ Unique Enemies We've prepared more than 60 unique enemies, each with their own behavior, movements, and skills. Enemies include both normal and elite minions, the latter of which will prove to be a challenge to defeat! With a variety of unexpected combinations of enemies and our unique combat system, Tavern Guardians: Banquet is sure to give you an exciting and refreshing experience on the battlefield! 10+ Epic Boss Fights What's a battle without a terrifying boss to face off against? Each boss' size, abilities, and behavior vary drastically from normal minions and other bosses. You might want to think twice if you believe that bosses will be taken down easily! In order to defeat each boss, you must analyze their behavior and avoid attacks from other enemies. Every single one of your decisions matters. Of course, a little luck never hurts! Choose Your Own Combat Style With 3 unique Guardians, each with their own looks and skills, and more than 40 active items and pieces of gear, it's up to you to find your own favorite fighting style to vanquish enemies in Tavern Guardians: Banquet! (New Guardians are under development!) Story Mode In story mode, you take up the role of a Guardian in the great land of Dionia. In your adventures, you've come upon a Tavern Master, who, after telling you his emotional story about his dreams of opening taverns all across Dionia, has convinced you to help him protect his taverns. Different difficulties of stages will grant different rewards, while players who choose to take on Survival Mode will get a leg up with extra Coins! Survival Mode (in development) If you fancy yourself a master of match three RPGs or any other strategy game, this is the place to challenge yourself! You'll face completely randomized combinations of enemies, and a randomized availability of gear in the shop! Survival Mode is sure to surprise you. If you're still not sure whether or not Tavern Guardians: Banquet is for you, check out our free demo!",
