    "About the game": "Cerridwen has fallen… Join the crew of the Celestra, possibly the last remaining ship of the Accord Defense Fleet after their home system was conquered by the Ragna Imperium. Now out in the vast reaches of space, the crew must work together to explore the galaxy and build alliances in hopes of one day saving their home. The Celestra is a text-based online roleplaying game. Similar to other online roleplaying games such as MMOs it differs in that most interaction happens through text, players writing what they want their characters to do, and in that it is an ICly enforced game. All character behavior is considered In-Character at all times. The game takes place in the Milky Way Galaxy 1600 years in the future. Mankind has settled the majority of potentially habitable solar systems throughout the galaxy. Faster than light travel is fairly difficult with jumps between systems taking a few days for those on the vessel but several months pass in relative time for those not on the ship. This makes managing civilizations larger than a single system difficult and most systems are independent, with their own governing authority and society. There are exceptions, with some systems containing many governments and some empires that span systems. Come join an immersive roleplaying experience unlike any other, sign up to serve your system, sign up to save your home.",
