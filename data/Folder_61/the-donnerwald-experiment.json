But three years ago, she lost her creativity during a nightmare. One day a charming mole named Montgomery appears in her dreams. He warns her that a Dream Demon 'cursed' her with something known as the Mare Noctem. The loss of her creativity is just one of the symptoms and she's about to turn into a monster soon. Now the duo is hunting Dream Demons together and try to find a way to get rid of her curse before it's too late. An interactive combat system with action commands. Aim with your skills and evade enemy attacks. Build and personify your battle machine to fight off Dream Demons. Find a way for “more inspiration” to unlock additional modules. Many characters, all with their own goals, fears and dreams. You can bond with them if you deem it necessary, maybe it pays off to be nice? A big plot tree which allows to see the whole story from different angles. Dogs which can be pet. Many special boss battles, all with their own high quality soundtrack.",
