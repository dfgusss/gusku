    "About the game": "Environment The Forgotten's environment is amazingly stunning, yet terrifying. Walk through the lush birch forest to the sparse snowy capped mountains. Be careful when you are travelling as there is always bound to be something around any corner or behind any tree. There are many locations in The Forgotten, anything from a town, to caves all with unique horrors to discover and they all have something new to help you uncover what is happening in this forgotten valley. Story You and some friends are on a hiking trip. You stop to set up camp for the night as it is already pitch black. When you wake it is still pitch black but you can hear screaming in the distance, you go to look but all your friends are gone. YOU must now venture through the terrifying valley to find what happened to your friends but watch out as depending on what you do will determine which ending you will get. There are 3 endings all with their own unique way of portraying the story. Game-Play When venturing through the unique map of The Forgotten you can come across many locations and strange dynamic experiences. Enemies may come out of no where and attack you, some enemies will just follow you and observe what you do. Keep a keen eye out for items that can help you, or items that could unlock a door or discover a key item that is needed for a puzzle. There are many collectibles around the games map that will give you hints as to what is happening and who these strange people in the valley really are. Key-Features The Forgotten has many features, from sneaking to avoid enemies or hiding in bushes all the way to real time events. While playing the forgotten enemies and animals will go along their daily life, this also means that the enemies won't wait for you to save your friends, if you're too slow they may be gone forever.",
