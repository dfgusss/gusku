    "About the game": "The Legend of Zuri is a 'pick a path' style raunchy adventure with over 180 CG images, 69 achievements and over 18 months of cooking in the oven. Princess Zuri will encounter giants, orcs and other crazed creatures during her travels. You will choose how she lives or dies and who she marries in the end. Supported by her potty-mouthed fairy servant Siofra , Zuri will encounter a variety of fantasy creatures, lewd bar patrons and suitors while trying to maintain her composure. Zuri has plenty of opportunities to make the wrong decision that end her adventure prematurely but that is all part of the fun. Did you enjoy the trips to the bar, the servants or the excitement? Save and load as needed, you'll find the path to the end you desire. All characters are 18 years or older.",
