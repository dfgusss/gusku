    "About the game": "Hop on the Puzzle Train with us! For thousands of years people have dreamed about traveling. As a species we have achieved a lot - millions of railroad kilometers, endless highways and the fact that at any given moment there are half a million people flying around in the sky. We are even on the verge of space-tourism. However, the most important journey is still beyond our reach... Or is it? The Ancient Greeks built the first railroads around the year 600 BCE. In 1895 the Lumiere Brothers were the first to capture a train on a moving picture. These are two amazing achievements but we need to evolve further. In 2018, The House of Fables has combined virtual reality with a childhood dream. We created a video game which offers you the chance to relive those innocent memories. Virtual Reality gives us more than we realize. Time-travel isn’t a physical reality (as far as we know), but a ride down the memory line is. We developed Trains VR as a bridge between the present and the past. A childhood dream combined with the newest technology. Hop on the locomotive and travel back to your past! Don’t try to time-travel to your past. Bring it back with Trains VR! Trains VR is a puzzle game that gives you the ultimate opportunity to find the best-fitting solution to railroad problems and relive your childhood: Challenge yourself with 40 levels of logical puzzles that have multiple solutions. Dive into a fantasy world of locomotives, train stations and magical stars that you will have to collect. Become a master builder and the fastest conductor of all! Build, Ride, Fail, Repeat and solve puzzles!!",
