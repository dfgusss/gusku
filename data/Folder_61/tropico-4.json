    "About the game": "The world is changing and Tropico is moving with the times - geographical powers rise and fall and the world market is dominated by new players with new demands and offers - and you, as El Presidente, face a whole new set of challenges. If you are to triumph over your naysayers you will need to gain as much support from your people as possible. Your decisions will shape the future of your nation, and more importantly, the size of your off-shore bank account. Tropico 4 expands on the gameplay of the previous game with new political additions ∼ including more superpowers to negotiate with, along with the ability to elect ministers into power to help get your more controversial policies passed. But remember to keep your friends close and your enemies closer as everyone has an agenda! Your political mettle will be thoroughly tested, as new natural disasters will have the populace clamoring for you and your cabinet to help them recover from some of the worst Mother Nature can dish out. Key Features: New campaign consisting of 20 missions on 10 new maps. 20 new buildings including Stock Exchange, Shopping mall, Aqua Park and a Mausoleum to El Presidente. Six new interactive disasters including volcanoes, droughts and tornadoes. Council of Ministers – selected citizens to ministerial posts in the government to help push through your more controversial decisions. National Agenda – receive objectives from Tropican factions, foreign geopolitical powers or opportunities relating to current island events such as ongoing disasters. Trading system – import and export goods to/from other nations to boost your economy or production.",
