    "About the game": "WeakWood Throne is a 2D Action RPG with the open world. In the story you will find out what happened in the WickWood Kingdom; why its inhabitants get poorer every day, and soldiers-beasts wander on their fields; what's wrong with the new king, and how to dethrone him. In the game you can freely travel around the world, while playing as a swordsman, an archer or a mage (or all at once), complete the quests, or go to the forest and earn gold by finding secret items and chests. Go on your adventure through the kingdom and defeat every enemy on your way! In detail: With the open world, you can earn gold in several ways in the game: • Wander through the forest and find various expensive plants, chests or hidden weapons, and then sell everything in the nearest village. • Hunt the animals and rob caravans of soldiers by taking away their supplies and gold. • Complete the quests, for which you’ll be generously rewarded by inhabitants. As in all RPGs, the ultimate goal is to develop the character to the maximum level and to defeat all the bosses that can be met on the way. At nighttime, the hero may find unique enemies and unique quests. In different types of locations there is a variety of enemies and items with unique characteristics and appearance.",
