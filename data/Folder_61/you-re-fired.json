Hire workers to build the greatest team of workers to do the best work that any company has ever done. Then fire those stupid workers so that your company can be even better than ever. You will be so great! No company has ever been as great as yours will be! Manage your weekly schedule to spend more time writing your book. It will be the most wonderful book that anyone's ever read. Nobody knows words like you do. Or decide to spend more time taking your employees out furniture shopping. Try to stabilize your business as it goes into an inevitable tailspin under the onslaught of overhead costs, investigations, and lawsuits that your amazing success brings.",
