    "About the game": "The security robots of Zettavolt Inc. have been hacked and are bent on tearing down the company from the inside out. Safe from hacking due to his A.I., it's up to Trigger to stop the rampaging robots before they ruin the fiscal year. Zettavolt Trigger is a sidescrolling platformer shooter with an emphasis on combat. Travel the 20 levels of Zettavolt Inc., starting from the basement and working your way up through factories, offices, laboratories, and more as you search for the perpetrator of the hostile takeover, Hacker-Prime8. Grab new weapons and mobility upgrades along the way to help you defeat enemies and progress past environmental puzzles and obstacles. Watch out for traps and ambushes left for you by your enemies. Take flight by joining forces with your ally, Clipper, the helicopter bot. Beware of hostile robots being upgraded by nano-bots, making them tougher and giving them new ways to attack you.",
