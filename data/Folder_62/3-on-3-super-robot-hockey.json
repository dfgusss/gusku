    "About the game": "3 on 3 Super Robot Hockey is my humble fun version of hockey. No fouls - so you can push your enemies away as many times as you want, and sometimes it ends up in a fight. Sweet classic organ music and awesome effects when you score a goal. Instant replays to enjoy your goal a little bit more. 3 AI difficulty settings. Starts out on easy. I highly recommend starting out easy as the AI will not knock you down and they're a bit sluggish. Play solo, or with someone locally. Locally - screen is shared. Fully supports Xbox controllers. Custom controls on Keyboard and Xbox Controllers. For Keyboard, the Numpad area is disabled because of hardware limitations (Several keys pressed at a time sometimes does not register). Mouse is disabled. Fully supports almost any landscape screen size. From small screens 4:3 up to ultrawide screens 21:9. If you have wider screens let me know if it works, that would be awesome. Technically it should, as I designed it like that but I have no way to test it out. Customize player names and numbers. More than 20 teams to choose from. Cloud Save for your settings.",
