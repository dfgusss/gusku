    "About the game": "You remember being badly injured, but how and why it happened are unanswered questions. You were making your way through the compound to find help. Your mentor's voice guided you through trouble and danger until the twisted reality of something unthinkable erased it. And only horror remained. And shooting. And the escape. And a flash followed by contusion. Be afraid of the dark and remember that any attack by you or by the enemy can lead to death, serious injury or leave no scratches. - 16 kinds of bullet weapons, shotguns and melee weapons; - 6 types of bullets, 4 types of shotgun shells and 7 modifications of melee weapons; - 15 types of light, medium and heavy body armor; - Various helmets, shields, grenades and first aid kits; - More than 70 different perks; - 20 powerful artifacts; - 5 enemy factions with different mechanics: heavily armed criminals, mutants with random DNA, bloodthirsty and almost invulnerable undead, robots that improve themselves with armor, sensors, weapons, self-destruct system and even dead human bodies, as well as an ominous black goo. - 5 types of procedurally generated levels: fights will take place in catacombs, underground bunkers, warehouses, sewers and outdoors.",
