    "About the game": "An Adventure Only Limited By Your Imagination. The most popular AI text-based adventure is coming to Steam! AI Dungeon is a text-based, AI-generated fantasy simulation with infinite possibilities. Unlike most games where you experience worlds created by game designers, with AI Dungeon, you can direct the AI to create worlds, characters, and scenarios for your character to interact with. You could lead an army fighting back an alien invasion, be a mythical detective investigating the attempted assassination of the fairy queen, or simply enjoy the pleasures of a simple slice-of-life scenario. Unlimited AI In this Steam release, AI Dungeon is offering its first-ever one-time purchase for an unlimited AI experience. On web and mobile versions, free play is action-limited, requires ads, and doesn't give access to premium model settings. In this exclusive Steam-only offering, you can play forever without worrying about energy limits. Unlimited access to Griffin, one of our language generation models Access to premium AI settings for Griffin No Ads Create Worlds Pick a character, a world, and a story. The AI will fill in the details for your unique adventure. Or choose predefined worlds from other users or a random one using our quick start! Take Actions You can decide what your character says or does. The AI will produce responses from other characters or world events for you to respond to. Every adventure is unique and unexpected. Make It Yours Save the scenario for later. Don't like the AI-generated text? Initiate a re-do or enter your own words. You are the main character AND director of the adventure.",
