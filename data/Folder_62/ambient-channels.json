    "About the game": "Welcome to Ambient Channels! Ambient Channels is a passive game with clicker and non-interactive modes. The current clicker mode is a hidden objects game where you find a pre-selected set of items. The low/non-interactive modes provide you an escape into ambiance. Hidden Objects / Scavenger Hunt Modes In the Hidden Objects / Scavenger Hunt mode, you pilot an invisible drone which can go through walls or an FPS controller, but in either case, you can casually navigate the scene to find a preset list of items. Passive Modes Different episodes offer different passive modes, we primarily provide a warp camera that you can control to move from one location to another as well as a rail camera which takes you on a cinematic course using a predetermined time scale. Infinity Jukebox To set the right tone, we provide Infinity Jukebox; a growing collection of high quality game music categorized into a large set of genres. Each episode has its own custom playlist based on intersecting a series of genres. You can also play music visualizers through Infinity Jukebox. Ambiance Machine New! We're excited to include Ambiance Machine, a companion media app, now embedded in Ambient Channels. It provides quick loading screen saver type scenes and an event scheduling component that can be used across any of the views in Ambient Channels. You set the time, duration, playback item to load (Ambiance Machine Scene, Ambient Channel Episode, or Infinity Jukebox Visualizer) and an optional music playlist and it will cut over to that view at the appropriate time and display a clock and time remaining/information for your event. (You can schedule multiple events and continue to the next one once you finish your event). When the timer is up, the playlist will be stopped and a sound effect will sound. Use it for Alarms, focused time, etc. You can hit F4 anytime to toggle the Ambiance Machine HUD to display a clock, Event/Next Event Information and a button to open the scheduler.",
