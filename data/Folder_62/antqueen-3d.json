    "About the game": "AntQueen 3D offers you the experience of playing through the cycle of an ant colony. Every spring, a few hundred ant queens will walk out of their hatching colony and attempt to found their own colony. The very first summer will give your new queen enough time to settle in and breed a few ants. Year after year, the empire will grow and the colony will gradually take control over a territory. The games offers you challenges in the Sandbox and a Story Line where you are guided to control a mature ant colony. Each game is different and you can dig your underground colony as you wish. Find resources, disinfect your colony from mold, excavate collapsing tunnels, establish a network of pheromones. Learn to overcome every challenge an ant colony will face. A colony is successful when each ant is in charge of a specific task. You can breed 5 different ant classes and each one is specialized for a task. You can additionally customize each ant to be faster, stronger, healthier or more resistant. Tiny nursers are best at taking care of the colony. Workers are fast and useful to gather food, but they cannot defend themselves very well. Diggers are strong enough to carry heavy loads. Replete are able to store food in their abdomen for times of drought. Soldier ants are the very mandibles of the colony, they are fit to explore and hunt other insects. Super-Soldiers are the exoskeleton of the colony and are set to defend the colony.",
