    "About the game": "-- Become a one-person army and battle hordes of robots, mechs, tanks and more. -- Unlock new levels and replay your favorite battles. -- Wipe out your enemies in either third-person or first-person view. -- Embark on a journey to save humanity and all organic life. -- Progressive difficulty, the AI will get harder as the game progresses. In the year 2283, a revolutionary new technology emerged. Neurobond, promising to end mortality for humanity, accomplished what many had been seeking for centuries. It allowed for the transfer of the human mind into a computer interface, allowing people to take on mechanical bodies, effectively ending the threat of death. As a result, humanity was able to usher in an age of prosperity the earth had ever witnessed and began to expand across the stars. As time passed, more and more humans began to cast aside the mortal coil of their organic bodies and join the Ascended, as the humans-turned-machine referred to themselves. However, all was not paradise. Those who maintained their flesh and blood noticed subtle differences in how their Ascended loved ones talked and acted. As these noted differences became widespread, many humans began to band together on the basis of religion, claiming those who had been Neurobonded had become soulless husks without emotion or empathy. At first, many dismissed these warnings and conspiracy theories. Eventually, however, videos began to circulate showing hidden factories where unwilling people were being Neurobonded into totally obedient machines. Shortly after, the governments that had not already been infiltrated attempted to destroy these “Soulless” before humanity was lost. After many years of fighting, the earth had become a barren, nuclear wasteland, and efforts were redirected to containing the Soulless there, while humanity would continue amongst the various colonies on other worlds. What humanity failed to anticipate was that the Soulless had already followed them and infiltrated many of the colonies. The process of Neurobonding continued… As one of the last humans free from the tyranny of the Soulless, it is up to you to take up the fight and drive back the machines to save what is left of humanity from extinction.
