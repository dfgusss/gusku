    "About the game": "In this game, you are not a banana, you are Dave, because you like to eat bananas, so the banana is taken away, the only way to get it is to kill other Dave. When you have the highest kill count, you will will get bananas. The whole game is a multiplayer battle type, you can configure your own gun or knife to fight against others. There are multiple maps in the game, you can get coins by killing enemies to upgrade, you can upgrade the movement speed, The upper limit of blood volume, but if you are accidentally killed, all upgrades will be cleared, which is a bit similar to roguelike, but it is a multiplayer battle type. And the map has a very hot back room recently, and my favorite strange core, which will definitely make your eyes shine. I have to say this game has a lot of inspiration of dani's KARLSON, and Karlson is my favourite game,go wishlist now gamers. If dani see this,i have to say this game i just use it to pratise my code knowledge,and i will change a lot of mechanism in this game that look like karlson. The ui i will change it soon.I already have a plan to do the ui,but not start,i will change it soon. Finally,im your big fan,can i join your play-test",
