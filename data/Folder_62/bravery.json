    "About the game": "In Bravery, the player must defend his brewery by building crossbow, automatic crossbow, and flamethrower towers, which can be augmented with minion pawns. Pawns can be equipped with hammers and shields if improvements are purchased for their brewery. Towers, minions and upgrades are all worth gold, which can be obtained from gold nodes, as well as collected after killing enemies. If the player can survive five waves of enemies, including the final boss, without losing his three lives, he will win the game! The game will also feature a 1-on-1 PVP mode, in which victory is achieved if one of the players destroys the opponent's tower. In the future, there will be equipment for the tower and pawns that you can pump and improve to guarantee victory in both PVP and PVE.",
