    "About the game": "In this strategic card game, you battle with adorable yet quirky cats! The rules are similar to mahjongg and poker, with a new tactical sense you'll love! Even though the rules are simple, the game is surprisingly deep, so the battle of wits and psychological strategies are so fun! [Rules] The basic objective is a build stronger three-card hands than your opponent's. However, cards are dealt one at a time back each round. In addition, battles can progress simultaneously in multiple locations. As a result, the strategy is not so simple as building a single strong hand. 'My opponent's hand seems stronger here, so I'll give up this battle.' 'I'll put together a hand that can just barely beat my opponent and hang onto my other cards.' These are just some of the different tactics you can employ! (*Note: For more information about the rules, see the 'How to Play' section within the game.) You can also use 'special cards' with unique effects to turn the tables! [Game Modes] Includes two different game modes, 'Naughty Mode', which is a quick and simple game with more elements of luck, and 'Yakuza Mode' which is a more advanced battle of wits challenge that requires more than luck alone to win! [Online Battle] Your opponent is another player somewhere in the world! Instead of bots, this game offers unlimited battling against other players all over the world! It also features a cute cat stamp function for sending messages back and forth! [Rates and Rankings] Features a ranking system: win and your rank goes up, lose and it goes down! Aim for the top in winning rates and total victories against players all over the world! [Friend Battles] We recommend using the friend battles function to play with your friends! If you invite them to a game, it'll be even more fun! [Cross-Platform (Cross-Play) Compatible] You can also play with users on different platforms! *Note: Any user found to have committed the following types of actions may have a part or all game functionality restricted. ・Inconveniencing or causing unpleasantness for others ・Slandering others or violating standards of decency ・Fraudulent actions such as intentionally modifying the game ・Sharing personal information",
