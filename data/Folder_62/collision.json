    "About the game": "Daniel has grown up in the Thick Oak Forest for years, living with his mother and father, working at the family inn. His father, Oliver, was drafted into war four years before the events of Collision. He is scheduled to finally return in just a few days. Maxx, a beloved neighbor, has decided to throw a party to celebrate his return. Everyone is attending the party, waiting to see Oliver and Travis, another veteran who fought in the same war as Oliver, finally reunite. A few hours after Oliver confirmed he is on his way, he still has not shown. On top of that, somebody has turned up murdered at the party. Due to his past criminal record, Daniel is blamed for the crime. He must try to prove his innocence to the government, along with exposing the real killer and exposing the killer's conspiracy to cause a collision with another dimension. Collision is a top-down, turn-based RPG. The story takes a major focus, however, there is also a wide range in side-quests, dungeons to explore, and characters to meet and help. Use a crafting system to create new tools not obtainable anywhere else. Find Relics in dungeons. Feel your way through mazes to find treasure. The choice is yours. Take on new jobs to earn money",
