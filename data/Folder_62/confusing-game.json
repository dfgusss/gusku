    "About the game": "Do you want to test your reaction time, quick thinking, and ingenuity? Then this is the logic game for you. You find yourself in a game world where the characters are ladybirds that are on different flowers. The goal of the game is to make the characters appear on the same flower. To do this, you need to run the characters of the game in a certain order (clicking on them game mouse). If you run them at the wrong speed, or in the wrong order, then you lose. There are hints, but they need to be found. At first glance, the game seems easy, but it is only at first glance. The game has three difficulty levels 'easy', 'normal', 'hard'. ' Each has thirty tasks. If you lose in two difficulty levels 'normal', 'hard', then you will be surprised, be careful! If you think that the game is easy, go immediately to a more difficult level and challenge yourself.",
