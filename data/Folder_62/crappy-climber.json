    "About the game": "This game was inspired by 'Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy' If you hated that, you'll hate this one too :) Play as Willy, a small boy with a lot of crap to give. Willy's cat died so the only logical action is to go get the cat back from heaven. By using poo to fling Willy. you climb your way along the unforgiving and difficult path to heaven. Features: Easy to learn but hard to master climbing mechanic using only your gut. A narration voice to remind you of your failures, hardships, and progress. A heartwarming and humorous story that you get to explore as you climb. About 1-5 hrs of gameplay depending your skill level No checkpoints, who needs them anyway. (it does save your position, so you can quit and return) Lots of poop.",
