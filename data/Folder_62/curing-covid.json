    "About the game": "Curing Covid is a falling block puzzle game. Match 4 colors in a row to clear blocks. Clear all virus blocks to win the stage and progress through all 20 levels. The title menu features a level select and every stage features a reset button in case all hope is lost. Stacking blocks to high causes you to lose the stage and have to start over. Inspired by retro games of the same genre. Curing Covid started as a solo project for an indie game jam with the theme 'Quarantine' and slowly morphed into a 20 stage block puzzle game with an original dubstep theme song and virus sprites.",
