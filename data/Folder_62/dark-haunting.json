    "About the game": "4 Player Online Co-op The plan was to stay at the Bodi Lake campgrounds for the night, but only after arriving do you realize the place is abandoned. Still wanting to call the day a success, you take a hike on the posted trails. However, after hours of trying to find your way back and with night falling, you and 3 friends find yourselves completely lost in the dark depths of northern Michigan, with nothing but a dying flashlight and sinking feeling that you’re not alone. The terrifying reality is that you are being stalked and hunted one by one by someone or something, and the only thing you can do about it is run, hide, and collect all 8 pages scattered randomly throughout the map to make sense of what the heck is going on and get out of there! You can choose between 4 playable characters and experience a truly terrifying game using the next generation of photorealistic textures and assets. This game is not for the faint of heart as the AI built will creep up on you when least expected, and not go easy on you if noticed too late.",
