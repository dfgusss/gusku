Once out of his cell, our fugitive has to find a way to survive by running along dark paths full of monsters and traps. The door is finally open; it is a mad rush of killing as many enemies as possible while trying to close the gates that allow creatures to enter this world. There is a letter, but it has been torn apart. Gameplay Description Your cell is finally open, and you are free to go and move in a vast maze. In the beginning, the labyrinth is empty. In the perimeter of this maze, there are 4 gates for another dimensions, one at north , another at south , then east and west . Every minute these gates will remain open for 30 seconds; after that, evil enemies will invade your world, ready to kill you. The more time passes, the more enemies will be present in the maze. So haven't got a moment to lose, you need to find one of the four Gate-Key and then find the relative gate .
