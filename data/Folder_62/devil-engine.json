The Andraste is the only hope to defeat...the Devil Engine. Gameplay Devil Engine is a high octane, classic styled side scrolling shoot-em-up heavily influenced by the best in the genre from the 32-bit era, featuring a variety of incredible locations, hand drawn pixel art, and a blood-pumping soundtrack that brings the dark future to life. Features Use 3 shot types with unique bombs to destroy everything in your path. Build a point multiplying combo with careful play and expend it with a bullet absorbing burst. Compete across 8 game modes for score supremacy. Leave a wave of carnage across 6 incredibly detailed stages. Points aren’t just for collecting! Spend your accumulated points to unlock in-game shaders, additional music, stages and playable ships. Pulse pounding music featuring tracks by famed shmup composer Hyakutarou Tsukumo.",
