    "About the game": "Don’t Shoot Rabbit is a mini game, as my first completed game product. Though I didn’t provide English UI support, it is just simple enough to understand how to play it. Tutorials and button pictures will guide you. The purpose of this game is mini, too. Try to compete with your friends, win a high score, and play fun! Something worth Noting: 1. Please play this game under window mode. Only 16:9 screens will get a perfect fit. 2. If you can’t run this game at 60fps, please check software like dynamic screensaver, and turn it off. 3. This game can be played with keyboard and mouse. If you want to restart one round quickly, press Enter(v1.2.1 changed). (If you have any idea of this game, please feel free to comment)",
