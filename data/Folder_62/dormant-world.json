    "About the game": "The Oneiroi (the gods of sleep) have descended onto the world. Everyone is asleep. It's up to you to try and save everyone from eternal slumber! Inspired by NES/Famicom classics, Dormant World is a retro platformer designed to look and feel like a game that could have existed 20 years ago. Dormant World is for you if you're a bit nostalgic about the good old days and want a 'game like old times, but new.' Not being overly long, the game is completable within two or three hours on a first playthrough and an hour on later replays. Dormant World Features: - Controller support (NES/Famicom USB controller recommended) - Toggleable retro filter to make the game look as if it's playing on an old TV - Hardcore mode (no saves, no continues) for added challenge - Level design featuring the four directions of the world and a compass to help you out - Three levels guiding you through mountains, forests, and a desert - A few puzzles to keep you on your toes - Bosses at the end of each level",
