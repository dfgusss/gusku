    "About the game": "Fighting drones have taken over the entire galaxy. Dronihilators are the last resistance of man kind. Prepare for battle and take the challenge of sharpening your target shooting skill to become the ultimate Dronihilator! The Arena Represents the place where you will train in order to gain the experience necessary in order to face the real threats. This room represents just a simulation so don't you worry, your life is not threatened, yet... The Weapons You will be equipped with the main weapons of a Dronihilator: two laser guns that are capable of neutralizing the enemy with just a single well placed shot. Despite their powerful shot, the main weakness is the fact that a cooldown time is necessary after each gunfire. Using both weapons can really make the difference! The Enemies Their army consists of different types of drones, each having a different behavior. With some luck, our spies have been able to identify several enemy units and we managed to copy their behavior and use it in our simulator. Scout K072 - It's meant for spying the enemy. Once it spots a target, it notifies his allies to start fire. Supplier J017 - This drone is terrible in combat but it carries a healing kit. Destroy it to restore +20HP. Thor W11 - Once it’s destroyed it generates a short powerful burst of electromagnetic energy. It instantly kills everything. Destroyer O53 - It’s a killing machine designed for one thing: destroy enemies. His major weakness is that it needs a short time to enter combat mode. Ghost Z9 - Lose it from your sight and it will hit you behind your back. The Competition As in any war, the elite soldiers will always be going to make a step forward. Prove your fighting skill by killing as many enemies as possible and gain a spot in the Top 10 Elite Dronihilators! How long will you survive?",
