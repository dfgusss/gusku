    "About the game": "With turn-based tactics, fast-paced gameplay, and snarky humor, Dungeoneers brings back the delight you felt during your first dungeon crawls. Use stealth and combat to obtain loot in monster-infested regions, then slay the dragons that have been raiding the village. This is the game for RPG or roguelike fans who want to have instant adventure at their finger tips. [A continual Internet connection is required because our servers roll the dice and save your progress each move.] Dragons to be Slain The villagers need a hero, and you're the nearest one. Each time you save the village from the latest threat, you'll rise in fame and unlock more features. Wilderness to be Explored Gather better weapons and magic as you navigate non-linear regions. Choose paths that offer the most reward at the least risk. (Room contents are generated procedurally.) When ready, enter the dragon lair and finish the job. Turn-Based Tactics The combat mechanics involve hex grids, attack modifiers, and poly dice. The strategy involves using room layouts to your advantage, wielding the proper weapons and magic, and knowing when it’s time to sneak, fight, or ... flee! Streamlined Gameplay Witty NPC remarks, without long monologues or dialog trees. Meaningful weapon choices, without complicated inventory management. Fantastic art, without annoying cut-scenes. Tag Team Heroes Use the best hero for the job, swapping mid-quest as needed. The Human Swordsman is a well-rounded fighter who excels with his blade. The Elven Huntress , with her archery and leaping ability, does best when keeping her distance. The Dwarven Brawler , relying on his trusty shield and deadly fist, enjoys charging into a crowd. With experience, each hero will gain new skills and improved feats. Weapons &amp; Scrolls You’ll start each dungeon run with weapons that only a blacksmith’s mother could love. That +1 Sword of Cutting Remarks will not always be helpful. Procure better swords, shields, and bows through stealth or force. You'll also find magic scrolls such as Flame to create defensive barriers, Leap to reposition yourself, Haste for a free action, Vanish to become unseen, and Bolt to cast lighting when you have all your orcs in a row. Monsters You'll Recognize Engage (or elude) 125+ monster types, ranging from Rats of Unusual Size to Lich Queens . Some creatures, such as Purple Worms and Cavern Crawlers , will attack other monsters, not just you. Monster art is derived from a popular line of tabletop figures by Reaper Miniatures . Outdoor Hunts &amp; Dungeon Tourneys Partake in daily hunts for an XP bounty. Join weekly tournaments to test your dungeon prowess against other players. Play from Anywhere When you aren’t on your Steam account, you can play from a web browser. Our servers save your progress regardless of how you are connecting. Steadfast Developers Dungeoneers has been in development for 10+ years, and our assorted wizards and gnomes are have no intention of stopping. We don’t have a genie, but add us to your wishlist, and we’ll do what we can.",
