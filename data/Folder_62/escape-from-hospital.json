    "About the game": "There is no dentist with a long line to him, from which you really want to get up and leave, although this is no less scary, the situation is different. In the middle of the night, you woke up in one of the hospital wards from a strange noise. Someone groans and groans. Something is clearly not in order, it's time to get out of the dirty bed and take up your hidden knife. But it seems that the knife will not be enough, so you need to see if one of the patients was reasonable and hid something heavier than a knife :) The gameplay consists of a search for objects and a battle with zombies. There are many rooms and doors in the hospital, from which you will have to look for the corresponding keys. Opening some rooms will help you replenish your ammunition, others will give you way to the exit from the hospital. The game has an inventory for a limited number of items. You only have to keep the essentials with you. In the course of the passage, you will find more powerful weapons. Each attempt to complete the game will be different from the previous one, as items and enemies always appear in different places. Cold long hospital corridors and intense music will immerse you in a frightening atmosphere.",
