    "About the game": "Punch a robot in the face! It’s 2037. Robots are running wild in San Francisco, and you need to stop them. Fight through multiple rounds against different opponents to save the city. Fist of Physics uses Midas’ cutting edge VR physics engine to let players literally reach out and touch their opponent. No cheesy canned hit reactions and physically inaccurate responses that break immersion; every response and movement looks real and believable. Choosing from a variety of weapons, the player can use their own body with the Vive controllers to engage in brutal combat. Each opponent has a unique set of moves for the players to learn to anticipate and counter. A variety of weapons enable the player to adapt their combat style to each opponent.",
