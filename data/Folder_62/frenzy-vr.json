    "About the game": "Frenzy VR is a game full of mayhem and destruction. You are placed inside carefully constructed environments where you can go mad and be free to do what you please in a world without consequences. A VR game where all objects can be a weapon, with the added bonus of having satisfying destruction physics. Ever dreamed of hitting someone in the face with a toaster? Probably not, but now I mentioned it I bet you want to try it! Frenzy VR is great for stress relief, anger management, and of course just having a bit of fun! Almost every object you see can be picked up and interacted with, and many items can be destroyed. Jump into familiar scenarios such as an office or an apartment, and go mad breaking everything you see! Enemies fight back! Use hand to hand combat, melee weapons and even guns to defend yourself from the hilarious ragdoll enemies that stand between you and destruction. Part 1 of the story mode is out now, with 5 maps currently available. 15+ maps still to come in future updates! With a great imagination, you can have endless fun in this immersive world in free play mode. With the freedom to do anything you want, you can enjoy wide selection of maps such as Prison, Labs, Nightclub, Rooftops, Cruise Ship and plenty more. Add attachments and cool skins to your weapons! Unlock weapons to use in story mode, or enjoy causing mayhem in free play where you will find weapons all over the place! Fight unhinged bosses in the large collection of custom made maps. Mini Games Along with the regular map that will make up story mode, there are several mini games you can play. From a mystical survival map to the iconic glass panels map, these extra modes are great for when you need to cool off from all the mayhem.",
