    "About the game": "This is a match 3 game with a dog theme. The game has an innovative goal achievement system. By matching the same elements, the dog's walking energy is collected. Once the energy is obtained, the four direction buttons are activated.Using a directional button, the dog can be guided in four directions to help the dog reach its home. There are also three other types of mini-games, and a bonus game. The bonus game is similar to The Pac-Man game, in which the dog needs to dodge crabs that are tracking him and collect all the bones that the dog likes to eat in order to win. Three mini games are jigsaw puzzle, find different and memory games. In addition, the game also provides some cute dog pictures that can be copied and used as electronic postcards and desktop backgrounds. Cute puppies are looking forward to your help.",
