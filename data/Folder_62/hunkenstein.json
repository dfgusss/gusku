DESIGNED FOR LOVE, BUILT TO KILL. As a handsome abomination of medical waste, you’ll walk an earth where Mad Science rules and scary movies have become reality. You'll face werewolves, vampires, clowns, mummies, zombies, killer dolls, and more. With an arsenal of traps and weapons at your disposal, you'll become a helpful part of your community. Turn those neighborhood pests to mulch! ERADICATE ALL HOUSEHOLD MONSTERS. Equip your trusty pickup-truck with the latest in anti-monstrosity equipment, including giant glue-trap, fall-cage, net-launcher, meat-magnet, gas-can, anvil-launcher, monster-mulcher, and the ever handy pitchfork! Raid the labs of rival mad-scientists to steal their work! Investigate and exterminate! Disappearances, exsanguinations, misplaced mummies. The night has many mysteries to unravel. Face a horrific variety of physics based enemies to destroy in any way you see fit. Meet the neighbors! You're not the only monster on the block. Chat up a cast of ne'er-do-wells and societal rejects just like you! Fall in love. Romance can be found in the strangest of places. Level up! Become faster, stronger, hunkier! Survive. The onslaught of the damned never ends, even at home. Be on your toes!",
