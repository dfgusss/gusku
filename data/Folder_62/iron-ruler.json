    "About the game": "Iron Ruler provides that quick 20-60 minute strategy break you need while your food is cooking, or your code is compiling, or the paint is drying... It also gives your mind a solid workout, combined with the fun and relaxation you can expect from turn-based gameplay. - On screen board game experience. - 20-60 minute games for a quick break or winding down after work, with friends, family or against one or more AI opponents. - Configurable procedural map generator offers a variety of challenges and requires just seconds to start a game. - 10 pre-built maps including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Caribbean... - A map editor for completely customized maps. - 4 seasons: Harvest, Development, Conquest and Logistics to inch your way to victory or plan a devastating blow for a quick finish. - A unique ruleset based on the triangular number sequence. (1 unit = 1, 2 units = 3, 3 units =6...) Kids, teens and young adults especially benefit from the experience. Battle royales and sims are great, but the older generations benefited from games that developped strategic thinking in ways that today's games no longer do. Conquering the world, a continent or a map of their own making a couple times a day during the brain's formative years might just work wonders over time! The triangular number sequence results in more impactful decision-making than the typical pitting of stacks of units against each other.",
