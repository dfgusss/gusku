    "About the game": "Japanese TeTris is Tetris like you've never seen before - incredibly addictive in stylistic graphics too! Although the meaning of the game has not changed compared to what it was 30 years ago, the graphics are amazing! Now you do not need to admire the black and white squares. In the game, edible desserts of various shapes will fall from above, which you have to rotate and move from side to side so that they fall and connect with the previous ones and form various sets that are amazing in their taste and appearance! Also, so that the game does not end quickly, when you can collect a whole row without a single gap, it will be removed, so try to choose as accurately as possible where and which figure to put. Be careful, because the longer you play, the faster the pieces will fall and the less time you will have to think and act! What awaits you in the game: - Soothing atmosphere. - Nostalgia for the times when the gaming industry was in its infancy. - Musical accompaniment.",
