    "About the game": "Kitty Rainbow is the 2D platformer where rainbows are your platforms, weapons and shields. You play as a rainbow-wielding cat on a mission to spread brightly coloured joy by removing bumble bees, off-beat music, and other unpleasant things. Your rainbows protect you from the bad things that can kill you and also provide you with platforms to walk and jump on. Cat on a rainbow Chasing you is the misery ghost who lurks near you at the start of every level. Initially stunned for several seconds the misery ghost wants to keep everything dull, grey and joyless. Spend too long shooting rainbows and jumping on rainbows and the ghost hunts you with increasing ferocity. Mysterache is your magical feline friend At the top of every level the Persian cat Mysterache is there to greet you. In his palace he offers you a random choice of three powerful permanent rewards to aid you on your rainbow mission. Touching his face removes all remaining enemies in play with his magic words and vanquishes the misery ghost. Gems and goodies To help you there are items to collect that appear when an enemy dies. Collect 7 gems of each rainbow colour and Mysterache automatically grants you another run at a level if you die - very handy since you only start with one life! Collect a powerup and enjoy a temporary freeze of time or witness the power of giant rainbows! Lots of Levels Many game modes from casual to hardcore, structured to random. Extra weird ??? levels every 7th level. Procedurally generated - but it's not a roguelike. Levels can be very small to very large where your platforming skill is tested. Can you reach the 49th level? 60fps Enjoy a smooth 60fps game. Yes really. Kitty Rainbow was built for super smooth platforming. 30fps platformers are the new retro! Kitty Rainbow has controller support ready and waiting.",
