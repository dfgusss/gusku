    "About the game": "Conquer gravity and land a rocket on the platform. And over and over again. But conditions will change, and the path is not always clear. You just need to fly around the location from one platform to another, but can you, when everything around you wants to break you. You will control various ships You can try your hand at both ordinary levels and mazes, where it is not immediately clear where to fly. And don't think it will be easy. Even an average level of difficulty can be problematic.",
