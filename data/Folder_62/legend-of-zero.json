    "AppID": 2094340,
    "Name": "Legend of Zero",
    "Release date": "Aug 4, 2022",
    "About the game": "This game is based on Fire Emblem and is extremely similar to the previous game I made, except much simpler. I've taken out all the unnecessary hustles and you should progress the storyline fair quickly as there isn't much of a story. The game itself is just a typical tactical RPG with only 5 playable characters and 11 chapters in total, should take you an hour to finish. Most characters can promote once they reach level 15 and learn skills at level 10 and 20, hope you enjoy!",
