    "About the game": "Legends &amp; Lore is a VR or Desktop (with keyboard and mouse) role playing tool . Inspired by tabletop role playing games (aka TTRPG) like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, and many others; the core of our tool is you and your friends telling a story together. You start by choosing between playing as a Game Master (aka GM) or one of up to four Adventurers. Game Masters create the stories and worlds that Adventurers traverse. Guiding them through quests for treasure, battles with deadly foes, daring rescues, and much more. As an Adventurer you roleplay as your character through those scenarios, adding your characters personality and ambitions to the story. The gameplay is what's known as a player driven story. Meaning every playthrough will be different. What you say, what you do, and how you work with your team influence the outcome and flow of the story. Legends And Lore is a dynamic system that gives unique tools to both Game Masters and Adventurers, in order to bring your ttrpgs to life! Adventurer Players who choose the Adventurer role design their characters. The design goes deeper than most RPGs, instead of just looks and skills you delve deeper into character creation through designing your characters alignment, backstory, and personal beliefs. You then roleplay that character and have all of that influence how they interact with the world and others. In a ttrpg your roleplay is everything and helps to create the story of your adventure. Game Master Players who choose the Game Master role design the world and npcs that adventurers experience. Game Masters act as the god of the world and are responsible for narrative flow, creating the scenario/environment, and providing dynamic feedback. Leaving them in charge of everything that happens (outside of the adventurers direct actions) and the overall narrative of the story. The GM’s job is to create an adventure that's exciting, fun, and challenging. Both Adventurers and Game Masters meld together to create a story that has the possibility to unfold in any way possible, meaning no two playthroughs are alike.",
