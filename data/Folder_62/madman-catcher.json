    "About the game": "The doctor who experimented with pills was left without patients. You will have to get new pills, but be careful: the escaped patients will not let you get them. And at the end you will meet the main initiator of the escape. 'Madman Catcher' is a classic 2D platform game. The main goal is to get pills of the right color from scattered first-aid kits. Just beware of the mentally ill patients, they are not very happy with your work (that`s why they ran away and do not want to return). Game Features: Classic gameplay Nice Pixel-Art visuals Steam Achievements support Awesome OST",
