    "About the game": "﻿Make boats and sail them. Build, explore, expand, discover. Sail your ships through changing water and wind inside the eye of a storm . Snap together planks, poles, sails, masts, jets, propellers, balloons, sparklers and more. Take care that it floats....and right side up. Cross the sea to find pieces to make your ship bigger, faster, stronger, prettier, stranger, wilder: more yours. Every island lets you redesign and rebuild. The world is a procedural arrangement of crafted islands, pieces and creatures. Each replay will present different challenges and opportunities at different stages of gameplay. As you push the storm back, new islands and new waters become available to explore. Find new pieces for your creations, escape giant creatures, and push onwards to escape.",
