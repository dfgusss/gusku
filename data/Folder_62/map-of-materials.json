    "About the game": "As the hero in Map of Materials, you'll embark alone on a journey to discover your past and escape from the dark secret of a long-abandoned land. Armed with a sword and a bow, you'll confront a threatening shadow that will try to stop you. Map of Materials is a short old-school RPG with some survival and crafting elements. The game has a simple, open story. It's my first game and I developed it in my spare time. I hope you enjoy this little adventure! Features: Explore - Explore an open world from a third person view. Game world - caves, ruins, tombs, various biomes. Survive - In order to survive, you’ll need to ration your food. Combat - With sword, bow and a little magic you'll fight dangerous creatures. Improve - During the game you can improve your weapons. Craft - Create items to help you survive. Loot - Find hidden items that improve your skills. Quests - These guide you through the game as you explore a beautiful world. Music - Beautiful soundtracks will accompany you on your dangerous journey.
