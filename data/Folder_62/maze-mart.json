    "About the game": "Maze Mart is a little exploration game where you have to solve one or multiple maze with collecting some objects to progress. There is many endding possible that will appear that will be direct consequences of the player's action. The main menu will evolve in function of the last endding or level you've reached. Rest assured that the maze arren't trapped but in the other hand if you do a long fall or steal a product, it can end the game independently of your will. You play as Isaac looking for a bottle of milk. Through small labyrinths you will have to choose how the story will end. Get the object so desired to calm his insomnia... Or will you make darker choices leading to defy the limits of this world? ► Le jeu As you explore this universe, you will be able to continue the game to go further or end it by performing a certain action (Desired or not!). From a 'normal' store, a hostile world, and into the depth of the system. You will therefore be able to discover up to 4 levels which all have a unique atmosphere, if you choose to explore the entire game. ► L'univers The world takes place in a fictional place in France, where time seems frozen. If I can give you just a little advice: avoid stealing, the supervisor is not very convenient!",
