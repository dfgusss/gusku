    "About the game": "The classic strategy gameplay updated into VR. If I had to describe it simply, I would say that it feels like 2017 and 1995 averaged out to 2006. I started this project to get familiar with making VR apps. So naturally this is my first one. I plan on updating this game as I work on growing my skills. This game currently features the 3 classic game modes you remember. You can also customize the board size and mine density of your game using the sandbox. The current options extend slightly beyond what was available on those old tube monitors. I need to focus on some optimization before I go beyond a 40 x 40 board. I am very receptive to feedback, and will make updates as my skills grow whenever possible. If enough people seem interested; I may even do a VR skiing or pinball game in the future.
