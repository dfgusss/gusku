They think that the killer is a necromancer going after the souls of half-bloods, who wants to use them for some horrible ritual. The protagonist, a young half-blood girl called Mia Silverlight, falls into a whirlpool of events. Will she be able to avoid getting caught by the killer, find true love, and discover the secret her uncle is hiding?
