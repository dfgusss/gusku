    "About the game": "Nijowari: Where Angels Fall takes places in a not-so-distant dystopian future where the demise of a major international power has made the world tumble, ultimately forcing it to evolve or die. Experience this broken world through the eyes of William and Adeia, survivor and victim of what is now an unforgiving reality. Will they be able to cast some light to the darkness that surrounds them? Overview Nijowari: Where Angels Fall is a rich, kinetic visual novel with two main characters, each one with its own story and its own life. Follow our heroes' steps in this daring mix of plot-driven and slice-of-life visual novel with heavy character development, an enticing yet dangerous world, and hard-hitting special effects. William Steele 'I was just an ordinary kid when my world blew up.' William Steele, a young man with a calling and our first main character, discovers that his region is home and that is worth protecting. Bent on helping his community, he ends up becoming a 'fixer', a counselor, sometimes friend, always driven to help people who deserve it. Adeia Berith 'It's not time to overthink... It's time to enjoy!' Adeia Berith, our second main character, is a coy, fearful, and innocent newcomer to Nijowari, a strange city with a peculiar society. Trusting the world she's about to enter is as gentle as her, she's forced to find her way, ultimately discovering a dark reality nobody knew existed. Along the way, both William and Adeia meet a cast of supporting characters that change their fates, for the better and the worse.
