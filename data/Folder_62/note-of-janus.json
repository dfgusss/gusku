    "About the game": "Sometimes It's our secrets that define us. A sparsely populated suburb. The mansion located there is inhabited by Marquis Ethan and his family. Marquis Ethan wants to expand his mansion. And he commissions you, the best architect of the empire, to build an extension. You visit the marquis' mansion before starting work. And you meet the members of the mansion and inspect the mansion. While looking around the mansion, you notice strange things happening there. And a terrible incident happens... What truth will you face? Note of Janus is mystery adventure game for single players. You are an architect who visited the mansion of marquis for extension work. You have to go through the mansion, talk to the people there, gather clues, and get to the bottom of what's going on there. The game starts at 8 a.m., the time when you arrive at the mansion. And you can act freely in the mansion until 8 p.m. the time when the incident takes place. You can look at things in each room or hallway, or you can move to another place. Every time you do something in a mansion, time goes by. You have to gather as much information as you can during the given time. Fortunately, the Marquis' consideration has prevented the members of the mansion from disturbing you. When you stay in a space, they won't come up to you and talk to you or anything. But if you move into a space where someone is in a mansion, you might overhear someone talking or talk to people you've encountered. There's a lot more going on in the mansion than you think. So you may not have enough time to get to the bottom of a terrible event to come up soon. But if you don't get to the bottom of it, the time goes back to 8 a.m.. Why does this time loop happen? And what truth does the series of events in the mansion contain? You have to figure it out yourself. You are basically given 2 items. One is a pocket watch that can check the time. You can click to see the current time whenever you want. At noon and 8 p.m., you are to move to the restaurant for a meal. Another basic item is a notebook that writes down what you see and hear in the mansion. When you find something meaningful in a mansion or have a conversation with members of the mansion, the note's contents are automatically added. One thing you can't understand is that even if you go back to the morning through a time loop, the note's contents stay the same. What is this for? Anyway, notes that keep records will be of great help to you when there is too much information to remember everything. It's time to show off your reasoning skills. Get to the bottom of the terrible incident at the mansion! And find out the secrets hidden in the mansion!",
