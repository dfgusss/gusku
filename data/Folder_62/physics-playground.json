    "About the game": "Physics Playground is a game that is all about cubes and physics. You are on a huge playground where you can be as creative as you want. Build a small tower or, if that's too boring for you, create thousands of cubes and let them all fly through the air. But be careful not to catapult yourself into the sky. tools Use your 'tools' to create new cubes, to move cubes, to fling cubes, to fling the player or just to wreak havoc. buttons Spread across your playground are large, red, glowing buttons just waiting to be pressed. physics Almost everything in this game can be moved, and when things can be moved, chaos is not far behind.",
