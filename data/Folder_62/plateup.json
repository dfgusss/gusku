    "About the game": "PlateUp! combines chaotic kitchen and restaurant management with strategic planning and development to create a delightful roguelite dish unlike any other. Up to four players build and run a restaurant from scratch, choosing dishes, buying and placing appliances – some of which can be daisy-chained together to create ambitious automatic kitchens – cooking food and serving customers. Players have free rein to design their restaurant which will expand and develop between shifts – with additional content and challenges unlocked through progression. Can you cook, serve and manage your way through 15 hectic days in your restaurant and unlock a brand-new franchise? Classic co-op cooking action, with a wide selection of mains, sides, sauces, toppings, desserts, and starters. Choose your equipment, lay out your kitchen, curate your menu and plate up your dishes. From bubbling soups to sublime salads, tender steaks to hearty pies, there's something for everyone. Look after front-of-house: seating customers, delivering orders, and managing patience. Equip your restaurant to handle the most fickle of customers and deliver them what they need, right when they need it. Co-operate with your team like a well-olive-oiled machine or build a name for yourself going it alone. Exceed your goals and take your franchise to greater heights at a new location, bringing with you new unlocks and upgrade Upgrade and rearrange your restaurant to your personal taste: when the restaurant closes for the day, the planning begins! Decide what new equipment to purchase, and place it wherever you want. Want to go high-tech? Install the turbo-ovens, crank up the conveyors, and make way for the robo-kitchen of the future. Fancy something a little more... fancy? Curate your art collection, fix up that wallpaper, enlist a friend as a maître d' and get ready to provide the culinary experience of a lifetime. Exceed your goals and start over at your next location, bringing with you new unlocks and upgrades. Tailor your brand towards gourmet dining, or fine-tune your fast food franchise. Every restaurant is procedurally-generated with its own climate, customers and conditions. Return to your franchise HQ to view your achievements, customise your characters and upgrade your kit, ready for your next adventure!",
