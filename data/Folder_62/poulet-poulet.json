    "About the game": "The Evil Mahi Mahi returns, as the Poulet Adventure comes from Fantasy-Consoles to your PC. Poulet Poulet is a simple but unique action Platformer. Each level is hand-crafted and play-tested to challenging and delightful perfection. Half Chicken, half-pinball, Poulet can beak-smash foes and bounce off of them, flying towards the next foe for a score-multiplying combo (or maybe to an untimely end!) Victory awaits at the end of 32 (or more? ) 2D stages across 8 worlds just like the platformer classics of back in the day. Set high scores, set speed-run records, and maybe discover a secret or two.",
