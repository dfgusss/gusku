    "About the game": "In the medieval Europe, to be the younger brother was a harsh business. The elder one often saw you as a threat - so as fast as he claimed his lands and title, he cast the younger siblings out or even killed them.  The cast out brothers were too prideful, to work at the villages or serve as wretched mercenaries. So they often formed bands and started to rob merchants in the lands nearby. They were well-trained, equipped and very ambitious. Which made them very dangerous enemies. They were called the Raubritters. You are one of them - but your story, started, a little bit different. Raubritter is a bridge between survival simulators, RPGs and co-op games. Survival - First you have to survive in the forest and build your camp, before you will be able to establish your band and sow fear in the hearts of the local merchants and landlords. RPG: Develop your character, your base and your band. Fight and build your legend.  Simulation: Create and upgrade your weapons, build your camp and his defenses, plan your raids and execute them perfectly. And if you are bored with robbing simple merchants, maybe you are bold enough to burn a village or an even castle?  Strategy: Decide who fights and who sustains the camp. Will you move your camp, so the guards do not find you, or do you want to build up strong defenses and fight them off? Many choices stand before you. Choose wrong and die.",
