    "About the game": "// The World // The world is made of cats. Cats are gods. Hundreds of years in the future, on an Earth where mankind has disappeared. A girl is summoned to a village where cats and androids live peacefully. Her mission is to create a base environment where cats can live comfortably while eliminating dangers around the base. She must also increase the number of cats to take care of. Ningen is not the only one who worships cats. Cats are now the idols of all life and non-life on earth. They are the object of worship of monsters, zombies, aliens, fish, demons, gods, and automata! We need to make peace with as many cats as possible, and ask them to move to our bases and live an elegant life. // GAME // This game is a so-called roguelike game in which you explore an overlooking, auto-generated dungeon. Grid movement is turn-based. If you run out of power during the adventure, your level returns to 1 and you lose any items you had. Each time you level up, you are presented with several random skills corresponding to the job you have set, and you can acquire one. Choose your job and skills strategically according to the objectives of your adventure. You can customize your fighting vehicle with resources and parts collected in the dungeon. If a combat vehicle is broken, it does not lose its equipment (although it must be repaired). (However, they will need to be repaired.) Defeating enemies and expanding base elements, especially boss monsters, will increase the number of cats in your base. The more cats you have, the more you can strengthen your tanks and add abilities. The game is currently in Early Access. The game balance will be adjusted and additional elements will be added through version upgrades.",
