    "About the game": "Rise of Humanity is a tactical turn-based deck-building card game set in a dystopian future where an AI has taken over the world. Take control of a band of loveable misfit heroes that survived the onslaught decades ago and help them save humankind! Each hero (and enemy) is controlled by a deck of cards, allowing them to attack, dodge, move and so on. Use remarkable weapons such as an exploding bunny to slay hordes of crushers, robot puppies and drones! Collect, upgrade and merge cards to build decks for each of your heroes and get them stronger as the story missions progress. Be the master of the playing field by planning your strategy wisely! For now, the game has 2 modes: • In Story Mode, guide your trusty team of characters on a mission to destroy the rogue AI. • In Daily Challenge Mode, fight in 3 different missions with 3 randomly determined heroes under battle conditions that change every day. Climb the daily and monthly leaderboards and become our champion. Rise of Humanity Supports Tilt Five™! Level up your game night with tabletop holograms! The Tilt Five™ holographic gaming system transforms tabletop and video games into vibrant holographic 3D environments.
