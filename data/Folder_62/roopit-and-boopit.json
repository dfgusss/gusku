    "About the game": "Roopit and Boopit is a local Co-Op puzzle combat game. Full of Charm, Character, and a Cartoony overtone! Roopit, the red player, has a bow and arrow. He can shoot in horizontal and vertical directions for the length of the level. Boopit, the blue player, has a sword and shield. He can block projectiles while not attacking and his attack swings in an arch, meaning he can hit diagonals as well. The difference between the two players' abilities creates a need for them to work together in order to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. There are 5 unique worlds of 10 levels, featuring a boss fight at the end of each of them! Don't have someone to play with? No problem! The game is completely playable solo, there is even an option to control both character's twin-stick style.",
