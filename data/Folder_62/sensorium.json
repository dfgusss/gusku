    "Name": "Sensorium",
    "Release date": "Aug 28, 2020",
    "About the game": "As lightning flashes overhead, you're transported to a strange, abandoned, yet oddly familiar world, surrounded by puzzles that revolve around the 5 senses: touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing. With no indication of where to go or what to do, you have no choice but to explore, solve puzzles, and try to find a way home. Staying true to the Myst-vania genre, nothing in the game is outright explained to you; a big part of the game is about exploring, learning, and piecing together clues about what's going on and how everything works.",
