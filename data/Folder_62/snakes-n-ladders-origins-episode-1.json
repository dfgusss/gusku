    "About the game": "PLOT Every ancient game has a story behind its origins. Scripted from an exciting Sci-Fi perspective, this is a story of how the ancient Snakes&amp;Ladders board game came to be. Millions of years ago the galaxy was devastated by a terrifying war between the Humans and Reptilians. It all began on a dark desolate Earth-like swamp-filled forest world in a distant uncharted corner of the galaxy. A Galactic-TriAlliance Officer faces off with serpent-like Reptilians while searching for an Artefact that could change the fate of the galaxy. Episode 1 delves into this first encounter between the two species, before the galactic war began. Snakes-N-Ladders: Origins - Episode 1 is a small, fun, tense, and entertaining shooter game. It starts with a slow rhythm, and ends with a big bang!

Map is the same forest as Episode 1; but you only hunt on the forest floor, not the stages above.

FUN FACTS ABOUT GAME-PLAY CONCEPT DIFFERENCES Only the most basic game-play concepts of the Snakes&amp;Ladders board game were integrated into this game. Board Game: The player has to keep going UP the board to the destination. This Game: The forest represents the board. Each higher level in this game is represented by a stage of wooden ramp-ways at a higher altitude in the forest. Board Game: Ladders assist the player to go UP the board faster. This Game: There are ramps that the player must walk UP to go to the next level. Board Game: Snakes bring you DOWN. This game: Enemy serpents either force you off the ramp-ways to a lower (DOWN) level or kill you altogether. The existence of the ramp-ways and the serpents is explained in the game.
