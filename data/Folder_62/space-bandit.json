    "About the game": "You are the infamous Space Bandit, one of the solar system's most wanted gun smugglers. Having been ripped off by a client, you and your professional business partner are now on a space rampage for revenge and profit! Gunfights are brutal and fast! Sometimes it's a surgical operation sweeping behind the enemy flank. Sometimes it's SPRAY AND PRAY. The environment &amp; physics are your weapon! Blow a window and vent your enemies into the void of space! Reflect bullets and chop up enemies with your sabre. Blow up enemies with grenades and then hide in the smoke while you shoot more enemies! All this and more if only you were good enough to beat the first zone. Features: Brutal (one hit kill) twin stick shooter gameplay. Hilariously clever fun AI that doesn't just run at you like an idiot. Teleporting... THROUGH PEOPLE. Exploding barrels everywhere. 4 Proceduraly generated zones and roguelike stuff to keep things fresh. 4 unique no bullet sponge bosses. Crazy weapons like the Rail Gun that shots through walls. Full mouse, keyboard and controller support. Kicking enemies when they're already dead because they could always be deader. A fine professional business colleague that chain smokes and spouts conspiracy theories. Shooting people out windows into the void of space. A game made with ❤️",
