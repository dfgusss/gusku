    "About the game": "Story Two overlapping worlds, Annfer and Ellis. One fateful day, Helios and Dion, boys living in Ellis, are confronted by Selene, a girl living in Annfer, who will vanish when she is touched by someone from Ellis. Why did she come to Ellis even with such huge risks? The encounter with Selene is the beginning of an epic journey for Helios and his friends across two worlds. We aimed to create a detailed worldview and an epic, haunting story like the old RPG. A trilogy of Ellis, Anfel, and World. This is the first story of trilogy.　 An independently developed battle system The 'ETS (Emotional Trinity System)' is an exclusive battle system for Tadahito that aims to create a trinity of music, scenario and mechanics. By timing your key press cues with the music it expresses the thoughts of the enemies and characters and the sympathy gauge will rise. Unleash your inner strength to the character's theme and challenge the strongest enemies! Battles aren't just about gaining experience and raising your level. This original battle system (ETS) directly reflects the player's skills and is easy to learn but difficult to master.Select the difficulty level from EASY, NORMAL, and HARD! Every new encounter with an enemy is thrilling and fun! Original music Every character in Tadahito has their own unique music not just our heroes, but also for each and every enemy big or small that lurks in the grass or behind the trees. With every new encounter you'll listen to a song that expresses their character and you'll grow to understand them a little more. As the story progresses, you may even begin to realize It's not just music.. Each of the main characters and enemies has a unique life of their own. Enemies are not just obstacles to be defeated in the game, they are people, with life-sized problems and struggles just like us. Every small insight into their own story progresses the narrative. The story of Tadahito has a dual structure of 'life' and the 'story of the world' within it. ・Tadahito:Story of Ellis Town Version is sold exclusively on STEAM.",
