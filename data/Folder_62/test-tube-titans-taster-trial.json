    "About the game": "Test Tube Titans: Taster Trial is a multiplayer-focused variant of Test Tube Titans -tube-titans . Note: The full version of Test Tube Titans is not available on Steam. I removed the game because I was no longer willing to be complicit with Valve's weak and hands-off approach to dealing with toxic and hateful communities on this platform. Video games have fostered an extremely problematic sub-culture and it is this industry's responsibility to do everything it can to tackle this problem. VERSUS MODE Wrestle your friends in 2-4 player local multiplayer. The perfect way to settle a dispute, prove your skills, or just unwind with a friend! (multiplayer requires a controller for each extra player) Every time you play you'll get a brand new procedurally generated titan: no two titans are ever the same, and the same goes for every fight. CREATIVE MODE Dive into the creative mode to create yourself a custom titan from scratch. Give it new physical mutations and special abilities. Then take it out for a stroll through the neighbourhood to create as much damage as you possibly can! A complex per-limb control system and a fully physics-based world make this an experience unlike anything you have played. Hours of fun await you in Test Tube Titans: Taster Trial!
