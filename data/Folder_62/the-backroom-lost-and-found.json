You find yourself in the deep end of a maze like office corridors and you must find a way out. The escape will go through different realms, floors, and you will meet some of the cute and horrifying inhabitants of this flexnugglian space. Can you keep your sanity, bring the lost together, and find your way out? FEATURES Coherent story with a clear start and end. Secrets, strangeness, and all around mysteriousness. Playtime approximately 80 minutes. Aims for a loving oppressing and uneasy atmosphere. Lots of Collectibles and Achievements. Contains one (1) jump-scare. Has a bit trypophobic content. No clipping.",
