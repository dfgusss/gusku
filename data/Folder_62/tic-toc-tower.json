    "About the game": "Tic-Toc-Tower is an action packed puzzle and platforming game in which players have only ten seconds to complete a room! Rendered in charming pixel-art, every random level also features an additional challenge. Players can choose to pursue the extra watch item in every level, picking up the watch will grant two extra seconds for the next level but is also an extra risk… With Tic-Toc-Tower, expect to be challenged every time you play the game. With tons of game modes, each with their bite sized frantic platforming and puzzling actions in which the player will be awarded for every successfully completed level, it will become a race to storm the leaderboards. And if the mayhem isn’t enough already, you can team up and battle with up to 4 players in unique, frantic game modes designed to break and renew friendships in all new challenges. Tic-Toc says the clock. You have 10 seconds to comply. Complete the level within these seconds, or else you’ll say goodbye!",
