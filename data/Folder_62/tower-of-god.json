    "About the game": "It is a turn-based game where you progress through the stage by catching enemies and gaining experience. There are 11 stages, 30 to 50 turns for each stage, and a boss comes out at the end. Defeat the boss to move on to the next stage. When killing an enemy, you can get items and potions with experience and chance. Items can be permanently held, but potions are consumed and destroyed. There are 7 heroes and can be obtained by clearing the stage. If the hero's maximum level is 40, the skill level can be increased to 3. It can be equipped with 6 items and is divided into STR, AGI, and INT types. If you are a STR hero, you can gain additional attack power by raising the STR stat. There are Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, and Legendary ratings. If you combine 10 items of the same class, you can get the next item. As you progress through the stage, you can get a collection-only item with a certain probability. The collection applies to all hero stats.",
