    "About the game": "DIVE INTO THE ABYSS Trenchlore is an immersive and ever-growing underwater experience that provides a peek into a very large universe. Take on the role of one researcher and enter Daqul, a vast oceanic trench teeming with alien lifeforms. Dive your way through various biomes, meeting strange creatures and dangerous enemies... all the way to the very bottom. SURVIVE Gather building material and berries and get to farming! The more berries you have, the better you can maintain your oxygen and survive underwater longer. CREATE Build your own underwater hut, bunker, or even city through an intuitive grid-based building system! Not only do you use less oxygen while inside, you gain protection from some pesky predators. STAY ALERT Be careful as you explore deeper and deeper! There are many monsters that would love to drag you to a watery grave. DISCOVER Trade and converse with the residents of Daqul, and uncover the secrets buried deep within the abyss! Everything hidden in the chasm offers something to be revealed, but it's up to you to interpret the meaning... Trenchlore is an indie game developed by Cameron Downey, with music by Braden Guillory and Dakota Downey. We thank you for your support!",
