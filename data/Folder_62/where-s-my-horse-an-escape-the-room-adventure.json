    "About the game": "Experience an at-home Escape Room adventure! Where's My Horse is an Escape-the-room style game that places the player in a locked room filled with puzzles to solve, secrets to find, and combination locks to open. While traditional Escape Rooms are timed and expected to be cleared in one sitting, Where's My Horse has no time limit, and the player is free to save, exit, and return at a later time. You have one objective: escape the cabin and find the horse! However, as the player proceeds with this task, the mystery deepens... Includes a built-in hint system to help you if you are stuck, a 'silent mode' which replaces all auditory clues with visual clues, and a 'colorblind mode' which assists in identifying color-based clues. You will need a pencil and paper (or a paint program on your computer), and you may need to search on a web browser to help you solve certain puzzles. Featuring a brand new, original game soundtrack created by Eric Francis!",
