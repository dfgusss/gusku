    "About the game": "Notice New we have suspended the development and maintenance of this project. We will suspend server renewals at 0:00 on September 18, 2020, It has been three years after the game's release. I would like to say sorry to you all. the players who purchased the game after the server was shut down. please apply for a refund by your self as well . Thank you for your understanding and support! please stay tuned of other games that we releasd on Steam! Developed by KX Games, Zhandou is one of the first MOBA style games available on VR and Non-VR platforms. Along with Zhandou's unique theme, playable characters, environments, and fighting system, Zhandou will be the first game based on ancient Chinese civilization and mythology. What you get when you purchase Zhandou at this point. Currently Zhandou is considered a 'early release'. Features (at this point) include: * The game at this point has 4 characters to choose from. * There are two maps you can play on. * Zhandou supports up to 8 players (4 v 4) and up to 4 on the PvE map. * Instructions on what to do and how to play Zhandou appears on the first screen when you start the game. We have big plans for Zhandou. With this being the first release of Zhandou, many features are still in development. However, if you purchase the game now you will get to see just how talented our team is and you will get a good idea as to where the game is headed. With this version, players who purchase the game will get in on the 'ground floor'. For a limited time players who purchase the game, will receive the first major DLC patch for free. As we develop the DLC, we will continue to make updates and bug fixes. So what you get with the initial purchase will only get better. We thank you! On behalf of everyone at KX Games and KX Games USA we want to thank you for your interest in Zhandou. We are a small indie game company. Instead of going on sites like Kickstarter we decided to release the game in its present state (early release). This way our fans will actually get something for their money. Not just some interviews and flashy trailers. Generating revenue now will help us develop what promises to be an incredible MOBA style game for both VR and Non-VR platforms sooner than later.",
