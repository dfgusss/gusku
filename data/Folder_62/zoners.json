    "About the game": "THE ROYAL GALACTIC SPORT OF ZONERS IS COMING... ...And the ultimate prize is on the table: A single wish of their choosing, to be granted by the galactic king, King Klianc IX! With the fate of anything &amp; everything in the galaxy up for grabs, it's well and truly... TIME TO GET INTO THE ZONE! WHAT IS ZONERS? ZONERS is a high speed, 1 vs 1, sports action game with tons of profile and match customisation options. Strike the ball with your melee, projectile, super and hyper &amp; dash moves to score in your opponent's goal! Keep scoring quick enough and you'll get rewarded with extra points and maybe even a satisfying Zone Break. But don't let your guard down or give up, as the double scoring extra time, a shield tearing Hyper move or even a catastrophic own goal could flip the tables at any second! And this is all without mentioning all the unique stage gimmicks to be found that add little zesty twists to your chaotic meal. FULL OF CHARACTER The playable cast is definitely diverse, weird and wonderful and even the menus have a band of quirky Zoners HQ staff to interact with. Encouraging, berating, whispering &amp; selling their wares to you, front to back, there's no shortage of personality to be found in Zoners. SIMPLE BUT DEEP Every character shares the same simple inputs, making them easy to pick up, but each has access to wildly different stats, skills &amp; spin types. It might look like souped up pong, yet with every character having access to ranged moves in their arsenal, there's always an opportunity to keep on the pressure. Every second counts! ACCESSIBILITY &amp; CUSTOMISATION A wealth of profile based accessibility options that can be accessed in any mode and will develop even further alongside community feedback makes sure that players of not only different skill levels, but physical capability can easily jump in and have their fun with as little hassle as possible! Want three giant balls whilst the players are slow and tiny? Infinite meters? Directional based ball gravity? Or maybe you just want to play first to a certain score? With the ability to create and save your own custom rulesets, there's almost endless fun to be had. To top it all off ZONERS features an amazing original soundtrack with contributions from CRYSTALBOY, Funk Fiction, Paris Stalker, Robin Hearn, Robkta, Vector U &amp; ViRiX Dreamcore!",
