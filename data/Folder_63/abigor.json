    "About the game": "In the world of Abigor, humans must constantly live with the threat of demon invasions from another realm. Their vicious and unpredictable attacks have claimed entire cities. To combat this, humans have specialized themselves into powerful demon hunters. Our story follows Alric, a young demon hunter who attends Alastor Academy. There are only three more days until graduation, yet strange events and numerous demon sightings have began to worry Alastor's principle, Headmaster Neithardt. Follow the story of Alric as he goes through the Forest, the Crypt, and Hell itself on a mission to slay demonkind and protect Alastor Academy! Will you, be able to fend off the demon hordes, figure out their weaknesses, and protect your school all in time to graduate? Abigor features traditional third-person action combat with a focus on dodging to survive. Additionally, Alric has the ability to use powerful enhancement magic that lets him switch his fighting style! Use the strong Dark Stance, the nimble Serpent Stance, or the ranged Light Stance. Choosing the right stance depending on the foe is key to victory. These stances can be freely swapped between, but keep in mind to manage your mana, or else you won't be able to use any magic. Slay demon after demon within the Forest, the Crypt, and even Hell itself on your journey to protect humanity! Abigor was made by a passionate student team. Thank you for playing!",
