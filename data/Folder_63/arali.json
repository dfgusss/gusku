    "About the game": "Fight your way through hordes of enemies, rescue the five forest spirits and bring them back to their tree, and lift the curse plaguing the Enchanted Forest! Wander through the forest, and witness the embers of the curse dripping from the trees and seeping through the rocks. You’ll come across a few enemies here and there, but I’m sure that it’s nothing you can’t handle. When you do come across a forest spirit, the curse will manifest itself and block you into an area. You won’t be able to leave until you clear that encounter. Alternate between fighting at a distance, shooting feathers at your enemies while bobbing and weaving between their bullets, and piercing through multiple enemies with your dash. Your dash grants you invincibility! Outside of attacking, you can also use it to quickly and safely reposition yourself during an encounter. As you gather forest spirits and bring them back to their tree, you’ll grow stronger! Be careful, though, your enemies will rise to your challenge, getting tougher and tougher as the game goes on. Features Pleasant isometric graphics Boppin’ music Silky smooth controls Tough but fair gameplay About Development This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
