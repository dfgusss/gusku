    "About the game": "Overview Raze the road less traveled with your Vulvehicle , the ultimate all-purpose armored combat machine! Whether flying through the sky or burrowing deep underground, these gals stop at nothing to blast through terrain and enemies alike in this comical action STG! Story The year is 2010 AD. The Avic branch of the Super Electric Science Institute is home to a quirky ragtag group of researchers from all corners of the galaxy living in harmony. Until one day, the TDF (Terran Defense Force) launched an aggressive armed campaign to eliminate all alien lifeforms on Avic and takes control of the land occupied by the institute. Standing in their way, however, is six beautiful girls armed with 12 different all-purpose armored combat vehicles known as 'Vulvehicles'. Can these carefree heroines really save their research branch and bring peace back to the planet Avic? Characters Cokel The imprudent screwball. Communications officer From the planet Adry. A good-natured gal who steps up to command the ragtag defense force, but always shows her boldness at the worst possible time. Her Vulvechs are the standard well-balanced Potato Masher and the holo decoy-equipped, disruptive beam wielding Mirage . Rummy The ostensibly cool collected fighter. A close-combat specialist from the planet Chaitram. She pretends to be calm and collected but tends to become flustered easily. Her Vulvechs are the SABER , which fires a splitting sword in a fan shape, and the DAGGER , which fires a dagger horizontally over a wide area. Erica The bumbling branch leader. The assistant branch leader from the planet Ramulon. Despite her questionable leadership skills, her presence always somehow manages to keep her rambunctious bunch of subordinates in check. Her Vulvechs are the FEVER , which burns its enemies with fire and flames, and the LIGHTING , which combines high firepower and high mobility. Manami The timid idealist. The genius human mechanic who made the upgrades to the assault ship Siebold during Operation Wolfram. She is an idealistic girl who is easily influenced by and often too trusting of others. Her Vulvechs are the KAZAKURA , equipped with bouncing ninja stars, and the GRAND MOGUL , which fires powerful drill projectiles. Phono Small size, big attitude. A highly respected biologist from the planet Rilt. She is known by her coworkers, however, as a mad scientist who uses her wicked syringe on others without mercy. Her Vulvechs are the Needle Kaiser-type wide-range attack vehicle PINK ELEPHANT and the Rocket Kaiser-type explosive attack vehicle MECH BEETLE . Q.T The easy-going cynic. A Cybernetic historian who plans to document the rise and fall of the galaxy. Armed with an acid tongue, she is quick to complain and ready to make sarcastic remarks at a moments notice. Her Vulvechs are the HOUND , which fires a barrage of homing missiles, and the BEEHIVE , which fires a barrage of refractive homing lasers. Gameplay Swap between Vulvehicles as you fight off oncoming enemies and defeat powerful stage bosses! High firepower, guided weapons, long-range weapons, high mobility......

Seize victory through the strategic use of [Teleport Change]s, knowing when to fight and when to flight, and effectively balancing the precious resources of your Vulvehicles.
