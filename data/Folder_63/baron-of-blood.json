    "About the game": "Baron of Blood is a pixel art platformer game in which you play a guy who has to fight through exciting levels and defeat different monsters. Collect coins to buy powerful items from a merchant that will help you in your adventure. The game starts in a gloomy environment where you have to deal with different monsters and ghouls. Equipped with a simple axe you fight your way through the different levels. The game is reminiscent of 2D platformers from the 90s peppered with fearsome music and sound effects. Plot: The game tells the story of a baron who was once powerful but was unjustly banished from the kingdom. He was betrayed by a dark magician who sought the great, magical ore Idirium. The baron possessed the largest Idirium deposits on his lands, but the baron is now banished and the ore for the dark magician is within reach. But the baron swore revenge and is now fighting his way back to clear his name and fight the dark magician.",
