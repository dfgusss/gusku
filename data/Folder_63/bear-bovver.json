Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Gameplay Climb up the building site ladders to find the batteries you seek. Dodge enemies that patrol the catwalks. Drop time bombs to destroy enemies, but be careful - you have a limited supply. There also exists a 'Baby Bear' mode, which allows you to play without enemies. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
