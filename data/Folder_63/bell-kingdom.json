    "About the game": "Bell Kingdom is a 3D platformer. Everyone in the kingdom has fallen asleep thanks to a wicked witch. Only Bell has the magical ability to dive into people's dreams, explore the weird worlds within and find inside the Hope Bells that can shatter the sleeping spell and free everyone from their slumber. Bell Kingdom is a 3D platformer heavily inspired by 64-bit era 3D platformers. Explore a castle full of levels, with every boss you defeat you will unlock more of the castle to explore. Jump, double jump, stomp, bounce and swim to explore a variety of dream worlds. And if any enemies get in the way, Bell can stomp on them or use her spin attack to beat them up! In addition to the levels you'll have to conquer to progress through the castle, there are plenty optional levels to find and explore, some more hidden than others. Explore the castle to find and beat them all! Take some time to relax with some minigames! Race against seahorses, play some golf, maybe a board game, who knows what is around the next corner! Bell Kingdom has a variety of options so you can tailor the difficulty to your comfort level. Extra health, more damage to bosses, adjust minigame difficulty or activate a slow down mode.",
