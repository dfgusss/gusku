    "About the game": "Call of Dusk is a multiplayer first-person game, in which the player will impersonate a citizen of a town called Baffakur, a place where the forces of evil have found a way to suck human lives and those caught by the curse also crave flesh human. As one of the few remaining survivors, the player will have to explore, create strategies to survive and face creatures that haunt there, all to recover the parts of the seal that was broken and save his soul from the curse. The player will have at his disposal a variety of weapons such as revolvers, rifles and snipers, as well as melee weapons. A challenge in the immensity of the night where only the strong will reach salvation and the weak will perish.",
