    "About the game": "Herding cats is easy! Said no one…ever Your main job in Catizens is to build your town around the personality traits of its inhabitants. Just like in real life, cats require personal attention and special treatment. Combinations of different personality traits and moods affect their proficiency and obedience.

Create unique cats and design the perfect home Pick from an assortment of facial and body features, as well as personality traits to create cats with distinct looks and temperaments. Design a place just for them by decorating the interior of their home with pieces of furniture, plants and other items. The better furnished a house is, the happier your catizens will be. So get creative! Build and manage your settlement Catizens can learn a variety of professions – from farming, to blacksmithing or offering protection from local wildlife.
