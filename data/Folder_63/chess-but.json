    "About the game": "We all know Chess is a difficult game, only masters can play it without blundering pieces and pawns every 3 moves, but in this game you don’t play against a 3000 rated grand master, instead you play against a 100 rated chess bot. It seems like an easy task, but what if you need to follow certain rules while playing? You complete challenges that make the game harder, but also more fun. Each challenge has 4 difficulty modes, which makes it suitable for beginners and experts. Some Challenges also feature custom starting positions: The game features a 2D and 3D view of the chessboard, a customizable background image and a fully customizable chess board. 'I don't particularly like chess' - Magnus Carlsen Things I want to add in the future: - Multiplayer Things I might add in the future: - Portal Chess List of some in game challenges: - Chess, but you can only move pieces and pawns 1 square at a time - Chess, but you can only capture pieces and pawns 3 squares near your king - Chess, but if you check your own king, you lose (custom starting position) - Chess, but you can only capture pieces or pawns that are attacking your pieces or pawns - Chess, but every move needs to have a common letter or number with the last one",
