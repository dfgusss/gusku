    "About the game": "Chico’s Journey Home When Chico the chipmunk stumbles into a portal in the forest, he’s transported to a magical world! Here he finds giant walnuts galore, but getting them home won’t be easy! Solve puzzles and challenges across a variety of unique levels, gather a horde of giant walnuts, and help Chico get back to his forest! Use your nut! With unique dual-mode gameplay, you’ll have to really use your nut to crack these worlds. When Chico is alone he can jump over obstacles and push wall switches. If he has a walnut, he can roll it over spikes, bounce it off of walls and bumpers, and more. Find a way to get the walnut through to the end of the level with you! Each world introduces unique new mechanics that will test your brain and your skills. A Retro Romp Chico and the Magic Orchards is designed like your favorite 8-bit handheld games. Catchy chiptune music, simple controls, and 4-color graphics evoke the feeling of playing a “lost classic”! Want to mix it up? The “Super Palette” graphics mode uses a special color palette for each area, giving them a unique feeling. Or find the hidden seeds in every stage, then visit the shop to spend them on new color palettes and cassette tapes to play in the sound-test room.",
