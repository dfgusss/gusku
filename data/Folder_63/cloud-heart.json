    "About the game": "The war that swept the heavenly world is finally over. The darkest time has passed, and now the world is full of trench coats, brass phonographs, art-deco-style skyscrapers, and all-night party music instead of machine guns and barbed wire. In this world, you chase the Cloud Heart, the legendary treasure, at the request of your benefactor. It's a thing that would only appear in trendy adventure movies, which even its existence is uncertain. However, is there a more romantic goal that suits this romantic era than a treasure hunt? And, you have a reason why you can never refuse the request… Humans are the only race that cannot fly in this world where sky islands float in the sea of clouds and flying is a normal thing. However, humans dream about flying more than any other race. So, they built a flight school. The main character, Celestine, is a rookie pilot who has just graduated from Canopy Flight School. At the request of Terra, his/her benefactor and best friend, he/she is searching for Cloud Heart, a treasure that has infinite power. Canopy City, where Celestine lives, is one of the largest and most complex cities in the world. Luxurious parties, propaganda posters left by the war, and unfamiliar races from sky Island are mixed in the heart of the city. Find where Cloud Heart is... and enjoy your daily life in this metropolis. -Basic system Cloud Heart is a game of turn-based RPG and adventure.
