Follow Sam, a goofball hitman through a dark city filled with scum as he tries to find his friend, Neil, who's in the wind after the alleged assassination of their boss, a powerful crime lord. With every goon in the city wanting Sam and Neil dead, our hero takes off into the dead of night in search of his brother while eventually coming face to face with his ultimate nemesis.
