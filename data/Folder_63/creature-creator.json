    "About the game": "Create your own creatures to explore online worlds with friends and collect parts to upgrade in this creative multiplayer experience! The creator is comprised of three modes: ✔ BUILD: Shape your creature's body and attach customizable parts to it. Each part may include special abilities that contribute to your overall statistics! ✔ PAINT: Color your creature's body and attached parts, and change the pattern of your creature’s skin! ✔ PLAY: Bring your animated creation to life! Upon release, the game and standalone creature creation tool will be made open source under the GPL-3 and MIT licenses, respectively. This will allow for creators of all disciplines to contribute to the project, let developers add creatures to their own commercial games, and provide students with a new solution to learn SOTA Unity technologies.
