    "About the game": "CycloHex is a twist on the classic board game Hex. The board has no 'edges' and going too far in one direction loops you to the other side like a PacMan level. The goal is to make a cycle that loops you though your color's edge and back to where you started before your opponent can. Despite it's simple rules, there's a world of strategy in CycloHex and countless ways to out-think your opponent! Play against your friends locally or online, or take on the built-in AI!",
