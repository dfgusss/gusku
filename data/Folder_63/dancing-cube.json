    "About the game": "If you are interested in Dancing Cube, add the game to your wishlist and follow us. You can also join our Discord server to chat with the team and other players. --&gt; You end up being trapped in the 'Dancing Cube' which deforms to the rhythm of the music. View and feel the music, while doing your best to survive the sudden changes to the cube. Challenge your friends and see who handles the beat better. Single or multiplayer Play alone or with up to 4 players, locally or using Steam's 'Remote Play Together' feature. Game modes There are 2 modes to play alone and 1 game mode to play in multiplayer. 'Playlist': In this single-player game mode, you have an infinite number of life points, but you lose points each time you get hit, which will affect your final score. The objective is to succeed in completing all the levels by obtaining the best possible score. 'Infinity': In this single-player game mode, you only have one life point and your goal is to survive as long as possible. Be careful, because the speed of the music increases every 15 seconds, which has the effect of increasing the difficulty at the same time. Your best time is saved at the end of each game in an online scoreboard. You can then compare your ranking with your friends and other players. 'Multiplayer': In this multiplayer game mode, you can play with 2 to 4 players. All players have infinite life points, but lose points each time they get hit, which will affect their final score. Powers, like shockwaves, will appear all over the cube to make the game a little more interesting. It is possible to steal a player's power by jumping on their head. Level editor Create custom levels using the level editor and let your friends test them.
