    "About the game": "Set in a Kafkaesque labyrinth full of office space, Decorporation is a surrealistic game, where you know two things for certain: The corporation that you work in, which is called The Corporation (huh...) is spreading something in the air that turns you into a workaholic. Someone is helping you from the outside and you are not sure why they would do that, but it's time to lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven or... possibly hell because the only thing that is waiting for you after this... is getting fired. That's why we have... Seductive, intense and highly addictive solution Be prepared to limbo dance between bullets, just remember not to get yourself into a coma! You can use a gun like a normal person, but who needs a gun when faced with keyboards, mouses and... CHAIRS! *BEEP* *BEEP* As a middle-class man, you have got to take your pills to function normally and scream no to your toxic environment! Time to meet your maker employer Elevators will get you floor by floor towards salvation, maybe your issue with the uncomfortable office chair will finally be heard... Because you are almost always under influence you often forget floor layouts so be prepared to get lost a lot. But when you will get to the final floor, just beware of any shiver, because the boss there won't be waiting for you to shake it off. He just sits there and watches TV. Perhaps he may watch you right now through a CCTV camera, so put a smile on your face :)",
