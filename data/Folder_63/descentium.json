Unlock amalgamated weapons, scientific trinkets and more as you discover secrets about those who came before you and the origins of the mysterious element... Descentium. As Alina , you will wield the power of the rifts and weapons corrupted by their touch. Push through the temple to find the source of this incursion, while growing stronger, revealing the temple's secrets and the downfall of those that came before you with every run. The void is ever shifting and uncertain, choose from a range of boons that will enhance your abilities and customize your weapon with a variety of upgrades. There is a broad range of builds to discover in order to fit the play style you want. A new challenge awaits as you step through the portal each time into a randomly generated sequence of arena style rooms. Use the Descentium Fabricator to create permanent upgrades and add new temporary buffs to the ritual tables and portals, giving yourself the advantage the next time you explore the temple.",
