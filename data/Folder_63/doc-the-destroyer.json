    "About the game": "Originally released in 1987, this classic game combined RPG, fighting game, and adventure game elements to create a truly unique and interesting experience. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Story On the raw rock that was once Earth, the remnants of Man cling desperately, huddling beneath the energy dome which shields them from the poisoned environment. Into this superstitious, barbaric world strides Doc the Destroyer. Outcast and heretic, he must survive the horrors of the fetid underworld and the gladiatorial arena, to confront the tribal elders and save the Dome dwellers from extinction. Gameplay Doc the Destroyer is a hybrid game. Make decisions on a branching storyline, but be prepared to fight in one-on-one battle sequences. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
