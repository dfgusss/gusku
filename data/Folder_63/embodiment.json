    "About the game": "Take control of M-bd3 (pronounced Embody) an amorphous blob created by scientists with the ability to take control of skeletons. Use their abilities as well as your own to traverse the facility. While along the way avoiding hazards and solving puzzles using your abilities. Take control of skeletons that each give their own set of abilities that you must use in order to survive. As the human, pick up and throw boxes to help traverse and push buttons. As the cat, use your speed and agility to cross chasms and climb up walls to reach the end. As the fish, you can swim underwater and perform a tailspin to activate switches. And in your blob form, use your tendrils to grab stuff and swing through the air. So, help M-bd3 overcome the many challenges that lie before him and reach the end of the facility.",
