    "About the game": "Evasive Maneuvers is a team-based online multiplayer spaceship arena game. 2-12 players are split into two teams; Runners who must escape the map through a warp gate, and Hunters who must stop them at all costs. Time is limited, so move quickly! The fight takes place in space, where ‘up’ is just a suggestion. You have full 360 degree freedom of movement, and momentum is key. Boosting rockets you forward quickly but leaves a highly visible trail for your enemies to follow or avoid, use it sparingly. Cut your engines to go dark, allowing you to coast through areas silently, to either avoid, or ambush enemies. Hiding is no coward's move! Runners can hide in foliage, smoke or behind debris remain undetected, but be wary as Hunters may use the same spaces to stalk their prey… What good is a ride without a paint job?! Choose from a number of ships on both sides, be it the nimble Sparrow, the powerful Trailblazer, or the menacing Scythe. Then, select patterns and colors to design the outside of the craft to your liking!",
