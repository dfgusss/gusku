    "About the game": "Your choices will decide the fates of many! Manipulate the castle above and lead heroes into battle in the world below in this real-time action RPG! Challenge yourself with real-time combat and a brand-new GRID system that expands your strategy options! In a world covered in miasma, a floating castle is the last refuge for mankind. The earth is scarred with beasts mutated by the plague while Welkin Castle is quarantined from the horrors below. Lucien, a charismatic politician protected in the castle walls, discovers an ancient book where he learns of the Exemplars, weapons that can turn into sentient soldiers. He joins forces with Rowena, a revenant determined to find a way to come back to life to raise her living son, and the two reluctantly make a pact to overthrow the mad tyrant controlling Welkin. Weaver of Fate: Influence the events within the castle through your dialogue choices, and determine who lives or dies with every decision you make. Unearthly Warriors: As Rowena, test your reflexes and tactical prowess with intense real-time battles as you command a squad of legendary Exemplars to decimate your foes. Forbidden Knowledge: As Lucien, craft potions and other useful items with Alchemic Recipes, and use stealth tactics to navigate the castle and discover its secrets. Twitch Chat: Fallen Legion Revenants for PC has Twitch integration! When enabled, your audience can decide the fates of Lucien and Rowena while you play the game by making choices right inside chat.",
