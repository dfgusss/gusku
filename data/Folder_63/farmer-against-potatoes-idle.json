    "About the game": "Farmer Against Potatoes Idle is a game about an amnesic Farmer With a past shrouded in mystery, that wakes up in the middle of a field and is attacked by a horde of mutated Potatoes. With no one else in sight, he takes it upon himself to try and keep the evil infestation in check. Even since release there are over 5 worlds with 9 Areas of 100 Waves, each with 2 difficulty settings, so YES, “it’s over 9000” waves with more to come in the near future. In the early stages of the game you will have two main currencies, Potatoes and Skulls, that you can use on over 30 upgrades that increase your stats or debuff the Potatoes, but don’t worry, this is just the start of the adventure. The Potatoes somehow have various Items There is a set of Equipment in every Area so there are over 250 visually different items but due to the Item Rating, Enhancing Levels and Bonus chances, there are over 2M possibilities for unique Equipment in the game. But worry not. We know storage management is not something a lot of people like in general but the whole system is custom made and with auto’s available to help you keep everything neat and tidy. The Farmer has a very particular set of skills Skills that he has acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for Potatoes. And each and every one of his many Talents, are made for the sole purpose of ridding the world of all Potatoes. Even the non-combatant ones if possible, as they make one hell of a meal. The Talent tree is huge, with choices that can change your play-style significantly. And the best part is that they are not permanent, so you can experiment to your heart’s desire. And everything’s visible from the start: no fog of war type of tree, no hidden talents … or are there? Besides the Daily Quests, Achievements and Challenges There are many other features that you can play with, including a mini-game that you can play on a regular basis to get various timed buffs for your Farmer. The idea is simple: whack all the potatoes that pop their ugly heads out of the johns. Why, you ask? Because being a Farmer is a full-time job and enemies are everywhere! A feature that’s almost always present in all idle games The Reincarnation system which Farmer Against Potatoes Idle also has. But every time you Reincarnate for bigger permanent bonuses, you can also change between 6 different Classes, each with their own strong points and Talent Trees. This creates a second layer of strategy decision making to make the game more enjoyable for various play-styles.",
