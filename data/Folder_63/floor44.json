    "About the game": "Floor44 is a survivor horror game with randomly generated maps, the goal is to survive. Unlock more abilities in order to make it to the final room on 44th floor of a mysterious mansion and discover the truth. The map will be randomly generated every time so that even I don't know where exactly to go, you can easily get to the top if you were lucky enough to find those super rare items all the time, or you could be very unlucky to have so many wonderers spawned around and make your way hard as hell. Sadly, you can't pause because it is not just a game. Enjoy :) Random System : The map is randomly generated, a lot of events will happen randomly as well, tread carefully. Search any containers, you can find food and drink, rare items and weapons Ability System : You have to unlock different abilities to survive longer, some abilities may seem very basic in other games. Use your abilities, first you have to unlock them Score System : You can earn score when game finishes, the score can be used to unlock abilities or purchase some in-game items. Are you sure you know how to use items? You can also use them this way Combat System : Unlike other horror games, you can beat those enemies in game, but you'll have to unlock the ability first. Learn to distinguish real/fake enemies, save your weapon's durability, watch their move closely",
