    "About the game": "Your new indie rouge-lite addiction. Battle through the nine levels of hell in a psychedelic watercolor painted world. Unleash your creativity to create a character build that will take you all the way to the gates of heaven. Pick one of nine weapons, pick one of three spells, and pick one of five elemental damage types. When you die and go back to the first level, come back stronger with the gear and experience points you earn. Even if you win once, there are always new character builds to try and gear to optimize. New weapons and spells coming soon!",
