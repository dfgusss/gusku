    "About the game": "Crystal Souls: Fragment Hunters is a top down indie space game where you shoot enemy ships, gather crystals, and upgrade your own ship. You're a soldier aboard the Crystal Shark, tasked with finding and retrieving the mysterious missing crystals. You choose a level, after which it becomes a horde-survival game. As you survive the onslaught of enemy ships around you, you are able to collect the crystals you need. The further you progress, the more items and ships you unlock. The longer you survive, the higher your rewards become. Every weapon and ship has its own pros and cons. Some are more geared for long range, others short range. Experiment and find a setup that you like. Aim at enemies, shoot enemies, pick up items, mine some ore, what more do you need?",
