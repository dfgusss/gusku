    "About the game": "Take control of master gardener Snippy Shrubs and keep your garden safe at all costs! A new take on classic LCD games, rethought through a modern lens! Complete objectives through the Trial levels, or hop into Endless to show that you can garden with the best of them! Collect Plant Food by snipping up any bugs that dare approach Snippy's garden, then feed the plants to grow fruit. Collect as many points as you can by snipping, feeding and harvesting your crops! Although things start off simple enough, rounds will get faster and faster as you collect points, so don't lose your cool! If an enemy destroys a plant, you'll get a MISS. Three MISSes, and it's game over. Collect the Extra Life Fruit when you have a chance! Features: Trial Mode - 18 objective based levels to work your way through. Endless Mode - Four increasingly difficult score attack variations. Mounting Difficulty System - As you collect more points, the game and music speed will ramp up! Keep your composure! Unlockables - Over 30 unique pieces of art to unlock as you hit various milestones. Stats &amp; Awards - Unlock content by hitting various stat-based milestones! Unlock eight in-game Awards to earn even more! Teaching Tools - An in-depth tutorial stage to get you started, and a series of unlockable Tips that teach both basics and advanced maneuvers. Garden Guardian supports the Plant-for-the-Planet organization. Climate change affects us all, and individual change is not enough to solve the problem. Every sale of Garden Guardian will fund the planting of a tree through the Plant-for-the-Planet organization. Although Garden Guardian is a small game, we hope that over time we can help to plant thousands of trees through this initiative, and we hope we can encourage other game developers and publishers to consider joining in to pledge financial support to vital environmental, social, and communal efforts.",
