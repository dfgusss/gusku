    "About the game": "Hear Your Path is a maze game where to find the exit, the player needs to listen and play note by note the music proposed by the level.

The goal of the game is to find the exit with as few mistakes as possible. At the end, the player will be evaluated according to the amount of mistakes in a five-star system . But don't worry , if the player wishes, it is always possible to restart the level to reach the maximum score, after all we can always correct our mistakes, can't we? There are 25 hand-crafted levels, i.e. 25 classic songs to discover and play. Levels divided into 5 worlds, each world belonging to a composer. Various artists; Beethoven; Mozart; Bach; Chopin; Inspirational phrases to bring new points of view and reflections into your life. Choose the background color. Choose the square that hides the notes. Try the game, have fun and relax. Read the reflections and draw inspirations for your life.",
