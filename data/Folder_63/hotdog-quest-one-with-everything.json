    "Name": "Hotdog Quest: One With Everything",
    "Release date": "Aug 29, 2022",
    "About the game": "Go on a quest to obtain a hotdog! Explore over seven realms in search of the elusive cylindrical meats, from the heights of Mustard Mountain to the ominous caverns of the Underdark. In the course of your journey you will uncover secrets both hilarious and unnerving, as well as a plethora of inscrutable video game references. Across the many realms you will encounter friendly NPCs and challenging platforming. NPCs have small side-quests for you to complete within their realm, such as finding a cowboy's lost cow or helping to harvest grapes in a vineyard. Help people with their problems and they will help you back, whether it is with information, powerups or coins. Coins can also be collected in the world, encouraging exploration off the main path and giving a helping hand if you can't figure out the way to go. As well as running and jumping, you're also able to drive vehicles such as cars and planes to reach areas you wouldn't be able to on foot! Play with powerups such as double jump, dash, and glide. The game is highly stylised, with a low-res low-framerate look and a reduced color palette. Adding to this is a retro soundtrack and bit crushed dialogue audio. This stylisation can be turned off in the settings, and NPC dialogue is shown in a subtitle box at the bottom of the screen.",
