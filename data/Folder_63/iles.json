Have your fun-loving chicken run, jump, fly, and eat the candies found all over the islands of each level in under 60 seconds. Each of the 50 levels comes with different platforming puzzles and items to add to the challenge, including reversing mushrooms, growing mushrooms, and hot peppers to dodge or take advantage of in getting those candies. Just don’t fall into the water, or you’ll get a fowl of your goal. This platform puzzle game comes with speed challenges that allow you to win new prizes to play with and bring out more game types. So gulp your candies quickly! Level Editor: Build your own levels and see if your friends can beat them the fastest. Make the fun continue after you finish the story. Creative Workshop: Don’t just make a level. Create your own fun designs using the items found in isles. Build as high as you want and make a 3D masterpiece amongst the waters around you.
