Defend your bases from incoming attacks Vicious enemies of darkness will attack your base, attempting to destroy your reactors and steal your resources. Build turrets and load them up with ammunition to repel the attacks. Build multiple bases and manage them all at the same time Instead of having a sandbox world, you'll need to build several smaller bases with finite space. Be on the lookout as all the bases keep functioning at all times and can be attacked by the enemies. Venture into dungeon-like expeditions to battle and find precious relics Adventure and explore to find hidden treasures, and fight enemies in auto-battles. This way, you'll get rare resources to use to your advantage. Research new technologies in different regions The game will have five regions, each with new resources and technologies to discover. Liberate the world by lighting beacons and crafting your own army The world of Illuminaria was taken over by darkness. Unravel the story about what happened on the planet as you clean and liberate the five regions by lighting beacons and sending your armies of golems to attack.
