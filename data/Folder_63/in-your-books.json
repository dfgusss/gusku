    "About the game": "In Your Books tells the story of a young woman going on a week long holiday at her grandmother's. As she arrives it seems that the old bookseller has disappeared, leaving the local bookshop closed indefinitely. Take her place to assist the locals. By learning more about them you might uncover where your grandma has gone. In addition with the tasks that awaits you at the bookshop, solve the mechanisms of a mysterious cabinet each evening to reveal some of her secrets. --- In Your Books is a short game (less than an hour long), a slice of life shrouded in mystery. --- The evocative, ambient original score and beautiful digitally painted visuals support a short story blending feelings, realism and reflection.",
