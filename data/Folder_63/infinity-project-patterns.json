A story over a decade in the making, '-Infinity Project-' is a multigenre series which tracks the lives of a wide cast of characters in their journey to find a place to exist. In 'PATTERNS', strange powers and void-like beings threaten the struggling normalcy of the Nameless City, a hopeful region at the end of the world that clings to a past life. Between the independent citizens of this city, its military government, and the dark forces that lurk below, who can say they really know the right way to live? Perform fantastic animated skills and team attacks, explore and speak to the residents of the Nameless City, discover the secrets that lie just out of plain sight. PATTERNS features a deep lore that will expand into future installments of the Infinity Project Story series.
