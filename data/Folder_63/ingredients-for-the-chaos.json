    "About the game": "Gameplay: In the game 'INGREDIENTS FOR THE CHAOS' you can choose between two different battle modes. - On the one hand, there is the action battle mode. In this mode, the fights take place in real time and you can't pause during the fights. In action battle mode, good reflexes and reactions are important. Quick evasive maneuvers or a well-timed counterattack are more likely to lead to victory with some opponents than blindly acting with attacking attacks. - Secondly, there is the 'BACK TO THE ROOTS' ATB battle-mode. In this mode, the battles take place on a separate battle map and the actions are performed alternately. When a character's action bar is full, he may perform an attack. In the round battle mode it depends on the tactics. Which opponent should my attacks focus on and which attack is more suitable, a magic or a physical one. Story: You slip into the role of the former mercenary Roman. After his last mission, he retreated to a small hut in the Levora Valley. One day, when a mysterious group causes a massacre in a small fishing village, order slowly begins to collapse and chaos spreads! Fate has chosen you to avert the chaos and unite the torn land! On your journey you will meet various characters and groups who want to take advantage of the chaos to acquire a high position in the new power structure. It is up to you whether you share their views and plans and support them in their endeavors. Each of your decisions influences the course and outcome of the story.
