    "About the game": "Beihnn wants nothing more than to live a quiet, uneventful life in a cabin in the forest. Alas, adventure calls! Take control of Beihnn and attempt to discover the origin of the force that poisons the land in this NES 2D side-scrolling MetroidVania platformer. Explore eight different zones and traverse various types of terrain in search of the power-ups that will allow you to proceed on your quest. Solve puzzles and discover secrets. Fight nine unique bosses. Talk to other characters for hints. Isostasy began its life as an indie NES game. This is the PC version. It is essentially identical to the NES version, but also includes the ability to save game data to a file, and configure settings such as controller input.",
