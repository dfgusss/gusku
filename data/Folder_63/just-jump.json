    "About the game": "Just Jump is a simple 2D Platformer racing game, where your goal is to set the best time, but with one catch you can't jump! With only 2 buttons to worry about, you would think that it's going to be easy. But fear not you will struggle. Prepare for a near impossible challenge. Push your skills and luck to the limit as you take on the challenges of this game. Game Features Left and Right movement! A Reset button! No! Jumping! A main menu! A pause menu! 20 Levels! Achievements Options menu Leader boards This game is the second version of the game, I first made it in 2016 when i started learning game programming and design, but I didn't feel like publishing it. The idea of the game came from a mistake in my original code, that caused the spinning. After some playing around with it I figured out I could make quite an interesting game. Now that I have had more time and had the game tested by my friends, I figured that with some more work on it, that I could publish the game. So the 20 levels that are in the game, also know as the old levels are the original levels from the first time I made the game. Game Features to come Customization Level editor Steam workshop Online multiplayer Split screen multiplayer Game modes Story mode Lots of levels Music",
