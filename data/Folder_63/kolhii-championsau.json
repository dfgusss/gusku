With the copper masks up for grabs, all bets are off in this highly competitive arena! Exploit every weakness your opponent shows, build up your own strengths, every mistake is punished. Meet new and familiar faces as you explore the island, and compete to become renowned in every village! There is no time for fun and games. This is where champions are made! Kolhii Champions is an online sports arena game, where players can compete in minigames and sports events inspired by the original BIONICLE series from The Lego Group! Players can customize their matoran using set and color accurate pieces, including pieces that were never printed in certain colors! Our namesake, the sport of Koli, is a game where a number of players up to 4 enter a field and each have their own goal to protect. Players kick stone comets into eachothers goals to score points and remove points from others! Strategy and threat assessment is required to come out on top! With graphics inspired by classic content such as the Mata Nui Online Games, or the Piraka Animations; mixed with modern visual fidelity, our aesthetic is one of revamped nostalgia. In this world first online BIONICLE experience, we aim to bring in not only old fans, but newer ones as well! We aim to craft an experience and community that joins everyone together, and further the legacy that the original series has created!",
