    "About the game": "ABOUT THIS GAME Campaign: An computer's artificial intelligence (AI) becomes the dominant form of intelligence on Earth, as computer programs and robots effectively take the control of the planet away from the human species. M87 is ex special force marine with that code, and he is the only one in this world who can take this world back. FACT The fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal. According to AI researchers, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile—or friendly—unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. Great Fantasy Worlds Discover new worlds and travel between one to another world easy, fight enemies , solve puzzles and save humanity for ever. Third-person shooter with amazing worlds and characters.",
