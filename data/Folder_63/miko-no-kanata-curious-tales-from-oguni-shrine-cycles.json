    "About the game": "~A totally traditional Japanese-style romance adventure game for all the miko lovers out there~ Miko no Kanata is a totally traditional Japanese-style romance adventure game that is a culmination of everything that developer Fan-na has put forth since they got started in 2004. 'Cycles' is the first part in this series and focuses on the first time the protagonist and the heroine first meet and the romance that awakens between them. All the heroines are miko! Fighting miko! Working miko! Moe miko! STORY In the classroom on his first day of school, protagonist, Kiryu Yuuya, meets Mikanagi Akiha, a girl with a mysterious aura about her. Akiha was the spitting image of a miko who repeatedly appears in Yuuya's dreams and kills him. However, Yuuya felt a strong sense of fate in their meeting each other. 'It's feels like we finally meet... Yuuya-san.' Akiha said those words, filled with a strong fascination in Yuuya. They were soon drawn to each other... However, Akiha's older sister, the miko, Koharu, let Yuuya in on a startling revelation. 'Akiha-chan... is not someone from this era.' A young woman's love that pierces through the vastness of a thousand years. The tragic fate imposed upon these fighting shrine maidens. And the followers of darkness who seek to rampage through the world of night... With those strong feelings alone, will Yuuya and Akiha be together?!
