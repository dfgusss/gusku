    "About the game": "Bring your original deck of cards and play against each other! That's 'MONSTER CARDS'! This game allows you to build your own deck of original cards and play against each other! Since these are your own original cards, they tend to be overpowered, but the game balance is maintained by using extremely simple game rules and a compatibility system. You'll have a blast with your family and friends playing online! 【Creating Original Cards】 The strength of a monster is determined by setting various parameters in addition to rarity, skills, and attack power. Finally, you can create your own cards by drawing the monster's appearance as you like! 【Play with your own original deck! Once you have built your deck, you can fight in card battles that can be played by up to 8 players. When your turn comes, simply play a card from your hand on the field. Determine your opponent's compatibility based on their card illustrations, and use your skills to turn the battle to your advantage! 【Recommended for...】 I like card games I like to draw pictures. Looking for games that can be played in a large group",
