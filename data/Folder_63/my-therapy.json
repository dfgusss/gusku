    "About the game": "Dating Sim Caricature! Not a single original idea in an original execution! Imagine: all the plot clichés, familiar characters and scenery, but turned inside out! Plot goes like this: The protagonist, Hideki Yozo, has just completed art therapy course after a horrible tragedy. Drawing is now his only skill, so he goes to start a new life in art college. But there he's met by perhaps even more broken people than himself. Namely: Although current version is rather funny: in general, the game is planned to be very depressing, violent, with a lot of content that many may find offensive. Keep this in mind before investing yourself in a project in any way.",
