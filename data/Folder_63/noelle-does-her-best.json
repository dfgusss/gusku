    "About the game": "Noelle has lived out in the sticks all her life, but the frequent monster attacks, lack of shops, and general monotony of village life has her itching to move somewhere with a little more excitement. Just as she's bemoaning her lack of funds, the opportunity she's been searching for hits her... literally! Carried on a breeze, a flyer for a house in Milum Town at a price that's almost too good to be true smacks her right in the face. Though initially wary, she enters MACS Real Estate to inquire about the property and leaves a proud homeowner. Unfortunately, Noelle's joy is short-lived. Just as she's getting settled, two mean-looking debt collectors barge in and demand she pay off her debt. Confused, her attention is directed to her housing contract, where she learns she's been fooled into taking on the debt of the previous owner! As if that isn't bad enough, she's given a paltry 10 days to pay back the monstrous 1,000,000 gold she owes! Will she be able to cobble together enough money in time, or will the life she's always dreamt of slip through her fingers? No matter what happens, one thing's for certain... Noelle will do her best! Explore Milum Town and the surrounding areas, taking on as many odd jobs as you can to build up your wealth and pay off your debt. As you do, you'll accrue Job Points that will allow you to take on a larger variety of requests. Just make sure to keep an eye on your Fatigue! As you work, your Fatigue will gradually increase, and once it hits 100, Noelle will be forced to turn in for the night. Once you introduce yourself to Rin, she'll provide jobs that will require you to venture into more dangerous locales, such as Coco Forest. Though Noelle can easily slice through any foe with her sword, try not to get careless. Three hits, and she'll be down for the count. Of course, the various items Rimuru sells can help make your outings a little less risky, but don't go too overboard. Remember, you have a debt to settle, and the clock is ticking... A Variety of Locales From a vibrant port town to a lush forest, there are plenty of places to explore... some more dangerous than others. Loads of Interesting Jobs Work at a tavern, help a mad scientist, thwart ruffians, and more... often all in the span of a single day! Relationships to Grow Increase Rin and Rimuru's affection for you by completing jobs and interacting with them each day!",
