    "About the game": "Overview 'PegSoli+' is a game based on the rules of the classic board game Peg Solitaire (or Solo Noble), with some modifications. This game includes a 'Problems Mode' to solve preset problems, an 'Arcade Mode' to compete for speed with automatically generated problems, and an 'Edit Mode' to create original problems. Basic Rules A peg (piece) can be moved by jumping over one other adjacent peg, and the jumped over peg is removed from the board. No more than a peg can be jumped over, and no pegs can be moved if there is already a peg at the destination. The game is cleared when there is only one peg left on the board. Once you have one peg remaining, the problem is clear, but it can be completely cleared by meeting the following requirements. Solve problems within the specified number of steps: Steps are not counted if the same peg is moved consecutively. The key is to move as many consecutive pegs as possible. Centering: It is achieved when the last peg is placed in the center of the board. Some problems have a set stock of pegs. The stocks can be placed anywhere on the board, and all stocks must be used up to complete the problem. Board Types 'PegSoli+' has 3 types of boards. English style This board consists of 33 holes. Movement is limited to four directions: up, down, left, and right. French style This board consists of 37 holes. Movement is in 8 directions: up, down, left, right, and diagonally. Gunma style This board consists of 45 holes. On this board, only continuous moves can be made in diagonal directions. Game Modes 'PegSoli+' has 3 modes. Problems Mode This mode consists of 120 problems for each board type, for a total of 360 problems. Hints are provided for difficult problems, and hints can be unlocked by using hint points. Hint points are earned through game play. Arcade Mode This mode challenges you to see how many automatically generated problems you can solve in a given amount of time. Depending on your performance, you will earn hint points that can be used in the problems mode. Edit Mode This mode allows you to create your original board. The created problems can be output to a password and passed on to other players.",
