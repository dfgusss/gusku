    "About the game": "There's a new position open in our company, and we're looking for a dedicated worker to take up a role in our freshly renovated warehouse. We need someone who's ready to put in the hard work for big rewards with a work hard, play hard attitude, where the job isnt just a job, it's a lifestyle. Responsibilities include: Scanning incoming packages and items. Placing them onto one of our patented mechanical storage shelves. Sorting items from acceptable and unacceptable stock. Focus on the job. We're looking for someone who can adapt to different circumstances. Sometimes birds or other creatures may get into the warehouse, and may disturb you and your work, so you'll need a clear head (and a flashlight!) to shoo them away. Following a successful application, you will have a first day where you learn the role, then either be assigned on day shift or night shift. Day shift hours are 9:00 to 16:00, night shift hours are 00:00 to 07:00. Roles are always filled up fast, so dont miss out on this amazing opportunity! --- This game features loud sounds, depictions of blood, organs, gore, terrible voice acting, jumpy scenes and gruesome violence, as well as implied suffering (And actual suffering, depending on what you think of the game). It should take about an hour and a half to complete. This game is PC VR only. Make sure you have at least arm-length space. Developed for Index, Rift, and Quest connected to PC, untested on other headsets. Please advise if there are any issues with your game. Folks with AMD graphics cards have experienced some issues with adjusting video settings ingame. If you use an AMD graphics card, do not change any video settings, or your game will crash. OVR Advanced Settings has also given some issues for users previously. It is recommended to restart VR without OVR active if something goes wrong.",
