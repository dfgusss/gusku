    "About the game": "A two weeks Jam Game This project is the result of a 2 week internal Game Jam done by a small, passionate and dedicated team of devs from Colombia . We used this as an opportunity to challenge ourselves into creating something fun, simple and polished. We hope you have as much fun with it as we did crafting it. The Game ' Project Possession ' is a 3D top down competitive 'Enter the Gungeon' type of game where the objective is to eliminate more monsters than your rivals in PvE arenas filled with enemies and traps. Up to 4 players can join a match. Each player starts out as a 'Ghost' who must possess monsters in order to use their abilities to rack up more monster kills. Each monster has different types of movement, attacks and HPs. Ranged attacks are strong but will consume mana. Melee attacks are weak and will refill mana. The player that has the most points when time runs out is the winner. Support We will make improvements to the game and it will continue to be developed. UI/UX improvements New mechanics and improvements in Gameplay",
