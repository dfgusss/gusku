    "About the game": "Projekt Everblood is a 2D top-down action game set in an alternate World War 2. You control an escaped prisoner of war who was experimented on by enemy scientists. Exact brutal revenge on those that took you hostage using your vampiric abilities of flight, feeding and deadly fury. Wield a wide selection of firearms that each provide a unique way of reducing the enemy to a crimson mass but be wary to chop and change your guns regularly as they will not hold enough bullets to clear the whole floor. Fight for your undying breath in boss fights against the facilities most mutated and deadly experiments. Be cautious in their presence; they are each as unique as they are formidable.",
