    "About the game": "Your pack is getting hungry, and it's your job to get them fed! In this top-down stealth game, your goal is to collect food from trashcans without getting spotted by the evil Animal Control. Run, dodge, and do your best to avoid getting captured because the pack is relying on you! Players can expect a fast-paced journey around a city, locating trashcans and choosing food inside them. They'll explore around buildings, trees, and fountains throughout the cityscape until they fill their inventory full of tasty treats. Once their food is collected, it's a race back to the Old Raccoon and to winning the game.",
