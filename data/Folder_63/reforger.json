    "About the game": "In Reforger, each unit can be equipped with a variety of different weapons, helmets or armors as you see fit to customize them, with powerful abilities at their back to turn the tide against the green menace! Field armored archers able to withstand returned fire, enduring healers holding the frontline, dedicated but frail wizards using overwhelming power to destroy your foes, or dexterous swordsmen taking down their enemies using speed and precision. The possibilities are immense, and statistics are not the only thing that changes based on their equipment. Your unit’s behavior is also altered depending on their loadout, so you will need to be cunning to destroy your foes. Reforger also does not rely on traditional RTS controls, instead of directly commanding your units you will guide and order them while their equipment-dictated behavior automatically moves, position themselves and engage targets. Each of them can freely switch between worker and soldier, and you will need to manage them carefully as waves of Orcs will test your skills, while you will have precious few seconds between assaults to recover powerful artifacts. Use technologies from the future to automate your resource production, upgrade your buildings or research devastating weapons to arm your soldiers with. Crush your enemies, regain control of the time machine, and put an end to the conflict once and for all!",
