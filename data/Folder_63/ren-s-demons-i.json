    "About the game": "You . This is a game about you. When you clicked play, did you even wonder what it meant? Did you believe it would only be about saving a dark world from an army of demons? Did you think about games that blew your mind and pushed beyond the boundaries? Did you anticipate the powers that you would gain? Did you assume it was just a game? -------------------------------- Ren is the Promised Child , chosen by the Goddess to save the world from the forces of darkness. But nobody expected that this quest would transcend the boundaries between universes and bring a new understanding of the fabric of reality itself. In this experimental philosophical narrative RPG you will find A non-linear universe full of optional content for you to explore A quirky narrative battle system A minimalist atypical colorful art style An entirely original cross-platform game engine built for the project Favorite old school RPG features coming back: walk on the world map, name your characters, and more A procedurally generated world different for every player 15 unique characters to invite to your party, more than 74 monsters to encounter 7 different endings Between 5 and 30 hours of content depending on how exploratory you feel -------------------------------- Translation This game engine is written in web technologies. You can launch the game in your own web browser using the index.html file in the game folder. When you do that, you can use your browser translation to play the game in any language. However, the experience will be very impaired (there are wordplays, riddles, and other non translatable quirks...).",
