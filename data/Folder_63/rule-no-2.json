    "About the game": "*YOU WERE JUST CAUGHT EYEING CHESTICLES -- THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO READ THIS: The sequel to the first one! Rule No. 2 is a fast-paced Arena Shooter FPS featuring one of the best Waifus going. You might think of it like a slightly naughty Geometry Wars in the first-person perspective! (RIP, Bizarre Creations). 'Rule and the greatest warm-up game are back for seconds! Kickstart your eyes, limbs and otherwise general biology from the vestiges of normal (boring) human behavior and become honed and sharpened as you battle an onslaught of Waifus and Geometry for your position on the Leaderboard!' Features: - Wisecracking Waifu (WW). - Plenty of action and guns (power-trip). - Sexy enemies (horny-making). - Difficult gameplay (easy to learn, hard to master). - Leaderboard (competition). - Image Gallery (ooOOOoo, artful). TLDR; It's an Arena Shooter with a banger protagonist (Rule), awesome movement, funny one-liners and guns -- lots of guns. 'Just buy it. I still live with my parents FFS.' -- Oddkins, Director, Walk Without Rhythm Games. ; )",
