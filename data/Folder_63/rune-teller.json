Travel the World Of the Runegea Runegea has many regions, including the Eastern Valley, Central Mountain, Dyra Desert, The Frozen Elves' Forest, and the capital King's Mountain. Experience the story of each region and find dungeons. Difficulty will turn into novelty, and novelty will turn into fun. Go With Your Great Friends The world of Runegea has many difficulties to travel alone. Find great colleagues and distribute roles. Whatever you do, it will be safer than traveling alone. You can have more fun with your friends. Create Something From Nothing The world of Runegea can be a threat to you, but it can also give you a lot. You can do alchemy by gathering herbs, or you can become a blacksmith by mining ore. Enjoy your trip while cooking and eating delicious food that is responsible for your health. Everything You Do Has Meaning You can experience growth in every action you play. You will become familiar with your main weapon and your spells will be more powerful than anyone else's. Everyone is the same at the beginning, but the results will vary depending on your intentions. Rune Teller, Complete Your Story",
