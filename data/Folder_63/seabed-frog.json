    "About the game": "Seabed Frog This is a turn-base-strategy game of physical collision Basic gameplay You will cultivate a frog and his teammates to constantly defeat the enemy on the map. The basic playing method is similar to billiards, but each ball is a rectangular square with blood. You need to consider not only the launch's direction and strength but also the square's rotation. Whether you want to knock the enemy out of bounds or hit greater damage, whether you cooperate with your teammates to attack cautiously or recklessly depends on your judgment of the current situation. In addition, each frog has its unique skills. You can constantly cultivate frogs to improve their skills. With special map props, you can play your style of combat. Feature 4 kinds of frogs with different skills 5 map special mechanisms 12 levels Ps At present, the content is not rich enough, but if players like it, I will add new map mechanisms and characters later. Of course, the price will also rise Leave your suggestions and ideas, and I will try my best to meet them Thank you for your support in making the game better and better.",
