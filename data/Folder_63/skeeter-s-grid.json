    "About the game": "Chill out on Skeeter’s Grid… Re-connect mixed-up circuits in this 80s-inspired isometric puzzler as you move from grid to grid, each of increasing complexity and variation. Collect components as you rebuild each system, with the chance of additional components spawning during replays. Find Skeet's 'Cores', and the dynamics of the puzzles change as Skeet progresses through this world of grids. Notable Features: Randomly shuffled grids with statistics recorded for every variation. Bonus points and achievements for using every light fragment on the board. Or just speed-run through if that's your preference. It's up to you. Original ambient soundtrack evolves as Skeet moves from board to board. Put on some headphones and chill. Gather up the components you'll need to augment Skeet's abilities or collect pieces of past guardians. Seamless transitions between grids with zero loading. Skeeter's Grid fully supports gamepad (including Steam Deck) and keyboard (WASD).",
