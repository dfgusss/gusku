    "About the game": "Roll Dice! Make Characters! Play Mini-games &amp; Strategize Combat! Gather a team of your very own characters and defeat the beasts of Spegroon. Slime Dice is based heavily on 2000's era video games and board games. Combat offers many decisions, both when creating your team, and while in battle. Roll dice, play minigames, and come up with different strategies to take on your foes. Make Your Characters Making characters is the first and most important part of the game. You can change the visuals, the personality, and even pick different stats and abilities. Do this not only for this character, but up to a total of eight! Will you make a party of mages? Perhaps a pirate crew, wielding flintlocks and axes? Or, will you make a team based on characters from your favorite game/series? The choice is yours! Play Minigames Minigames are a small but important part of the game. There are a variety of minigames, and you'll end up playing one before combat! From Snake to Sliders, playing and mastering them will grant you bonuses in combat, which can really turn the tide of any fight! Roll Yatzi To Fight Attacking consists of dice rolls and strategic action. Instead of just rolling one die for attacks and using that, you instead roll three dice. After the roll is done, you can select what dice to keep and what to reroll. Different weapons have specials that can be rolled, so deciding what dice to reroll isn't a simple action, but something that alone adds a ton of depth, while remaining fairly simple.",
