    "About the game": "Solitude Underwater is a short horror-adventure game where you play as one of two treasure-hunting brothers who are searching for a long-lost ship filled with sunken treasure, but everything goes wrong… FEATURES Original Sound Track made by Rozmis B. Gergő In Depth Story created by Louis Badalament Voice Acting by the very talented Jake Johnston and Louis Badalament GAMEPLAY After a deceptively calm start aboard the boat with your brother, you’ll soon find yourself trapped in a shark cage at the bottom of the ocean.  A cage broken in such a way where the sharks can get in, but you can’t get out.  You will have to fend off the hungry sharks armed with nothing but the light from your phone… and did we mention its battery is almost dead?  As if that wasn’t bad enough, your oxygen tank is also broken; be very careful about when and how long you draw your next breath!  And if you somehow manage to find a way to escape the cage, other challenges still lie ahead!  Will you somehow manage to survive this deep-sea nightmare?",
