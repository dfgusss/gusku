    "About the game": "'Subuccus' is a 2D side-scroller arcade game. The main goal is to control (with mouse clicks) three chains followed by a demon and destroy the unfaithful subuccuses while avoiding the wrath of the main demon who punches and tries to crush the poorly functioning demon. Demons rule in the underworld, and one of their jobs is to destroy the unfaithful to the throne - the apostates of the underworld, but you hesitated so much that the main demon decided to destroy everyone, so you have to finish the job before he crushes everyone with his mighty fist! Game Features: One-button controls Hardcore gameplay Steam Achievements support Nice visuals",
