    "About the game": "Bearded Dragons is a lightning-fast indie brawler that explores identity politics and gender expression through the tongue-in-cheek battles and cash-grabbing antics of bearded drag queens. Players face off in quick-pickup, samurai-style combat, using a variety of attacks and mobility techniques to best their opponents. For every hit landed or smash/kill secured, cash tips rain from the sky, and the player with the most money at the end of the round takes the crown. In the story mode preview, follow a bearded queen on her journey of self acceptance, as she works to overcome loneliness, poverty, self-doubt, homophobia, and even discrimination from within the drag community. She faces off against headless torsos, street thugs, police officers, and a litany of other drag queens as she goes from busted to dusted and discovers the real meaning of drag. In the versus mode (Face Off), up to four local players go head to head in quick-pickup combat, controlling a diverse set of bearded drag queens and kings. They explore a range of unique stages representative of real and virtual queer spaces, all the while grabbing as many cash tips as possible. This is a passion project by a solo-developer, and it will continue to receive updates until it's ready to leave early access.",
