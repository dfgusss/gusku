CHARACTERS Chihaya Inudoh (Voice: Tsuruya Haruto) An exorcist priestess from Kijimori Shrine who sees her training as her purpose in life. She is a friendly and cheerful person, but is also a girl who acts on her beliefs. Kijimori Shrine has given her a few years off. Thus, she travels to Inakibi Village to pursue her childhood rival, Yuuma, whom she'd been training with for a certain purpose. She meets her best friend, Yukari, during this visit. She now hangs out at Inakibi Shrine, where Yukari lives, whenever she's completed her duties. Currently, she helps Yuuma and Yukari with their work as part of her training whenever she's free. Yukari Kaburagi (Voice: Haru Aoi) A cute and petite freelance exorcist priestess. She is the only daughter of Inakibi Shrine, which originally had nothing to do with youkai. Her way of speaking and gestures are childish, making her appear carefree and naive. But at her core, she's quite tough. Currently, she is working as a youkai exorcist with her childhood friend, Yuuma--a secret she keeps from her parents. Because she wishes to protect everyone's lives, she can be a bit reckless. She's insecure about her height and appearance. Yuuma Nagumo A freelance youkai exorcist. Yuuma previously trained at Kijimori Shrine, but after a certain incident took place, he left the shrine and now earns a living as a freelance youkai exorcist. He now works alongside his childhood friend, an exorcist priestess named Yukari, in Inakibi, the village where he spent his youth.",
