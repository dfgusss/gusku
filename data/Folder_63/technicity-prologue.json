    "About the game": "This is a prologue for the full game 'Technicity'. / Technicity: Prologue let you test your skills in this first-person city building game where you can also design your own construction blocks and items to create really unique buildings. Use cranes to speed up construction, terraform the open world, build roads and use vehicles to travel in the city that you or your friends create in solo or coop mode. In the full version of the game, you will be able to develop your city on a larger area, you will have more tasks to complete, tools to use, and new types of buildings to create. Use a crane or a cement mixer to quickly build houses, shops, factories and any other building you can think of. The design is yours: with a large variety of building blocks of different shapes and materials, you can really create whatever you want. You can then save a schematic from any building you made and start construction of the same building somewhere else. Share your schematics in the Steam Workshop and use other players' creations. The open world is huge, an existing road network with thousands of km's lets you reach every part of the 384 km2 map. In the Prologue you can start to build your city in a 4 km2 limited area, while in the full game the world can be filled with many big cities. Build your own roads and they'll be integrated into the navigation system. Terraform the world with steamrollers and bulldozers - you can even create or remove entire mountains! Design and produce your own building blocks, items and furniture in factories, and use them to create really unique buildings. The items you design can also have useful features: create a garage door that opens, an illuminated sign or even a vehicle. Any other player in your world can then use the items produced in your factories. Invite your friends to join your world and build new cities or have fun with some role play. The prologue includes a co-op mode with up to 4 players. Share your best building schematics in the Steam Workshop and discover what other players have made. In the full game, you'll be able to share entire maps in the workshop.",
