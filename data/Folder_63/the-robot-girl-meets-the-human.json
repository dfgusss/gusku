    "About the game": "This is an adventure game in which you lead Scarlet, a robot girl, on a journey through a world after humans have disappeared. Story The day when humans disappeared, a shooting star shone in the sky. . In an empty laboratory, a robot girl, Scarlet, wakes up. She was created with the mission of 'make smile as much people as possible', and shortly after her awakening, she decides to embark on a journey to find any human she could. You will play the role of 'Mother', a computer that manages all the robots around the world, and guide her. Don't worry, though! Scarlet is a smart robot, so all you have to do is act according to what she needs. System Scarlet is a high-performance robot, so she can control machines remotely or use her sensors to find small objects. She'll be using these abilities through the story to search for clues to find the humans. Graphically speaking the game is comprised of a combination of 3D models for the environment and 2D illustrations for characters and relevant objects to create the feeling of depth while making the gameplay easy-to-operate. Like Undertale and Oneshot, this game is recommended for those who want to be moved by the story woven by the player's interactions with the characters and enjoy the mysterious but somehow gentle worldview.",
