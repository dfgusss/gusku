    "About the game": "Tiles II is a minimalist battle royale where you play as a cube, alone against all or in team, where you must conquer as much territory as possible in a giant arena before your opponents! The game has several game modes: Normal mode Challenge your friends on the arena in a limited time, move freely in the arena and avoid other players from eating your territory. Elimination mode Compete in a battle royale where players are eliminated as they run out of territories. Will you be up to it of not being eliminated? Contamination mode Survivors, run away from infected players and tiles for as long as possible! Power mode Fight in a game where all the moves are allowed with the many power-ups! Arena offensive mode Challenge the opposing team by conquering as much territory as possible from each side and earn the most points to win! The game features a customization system, where you can choose mutators to create the game you like, as well as a simple map editor of 128 tiles by 128.",
