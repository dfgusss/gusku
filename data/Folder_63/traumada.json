    "About the game": "As we revisit our memories, they change. How do we know what is real? How do we know who we can trust? Our seemingly peaceful neighborhoods house monsters disguised in human skin. These monsters live on the innocence of our children, leaving them wandering confused in the afterlife, forever alone and afraid. Our minds give the monsters a place to live, even after they are gone. Sometimes, we become the monsters. Is there really a mystery to be solved? Or is this all in my head? I have no plan. I have no place left to hide. Am I the missing? Or am I the taker? I'll let time find out for me. It will unfold with or without me. Explore the nightmare version of my childhood home. Uncover clues to the disappearance of a local girl in the 1950s or descend into madness trying. Plays in the style of a PS1/PS2 game with modern controls. First-person 3D perspective. Exploration and puzzle solving. Atmospheric horror and the occasional jumpscares to satisfy your indie horror desires.
