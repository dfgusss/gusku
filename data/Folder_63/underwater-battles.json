    "About the game": "Underwater battles - casual puzzle game made in 2D graphics. You have three attempts to kill all the fish, sometimes moving in a curved line, and sometimes along the optimally fast route across the screen in the direction of the starfish. If the fish manage to reach the starfish 4 times, then the game is considered lost. You have to shoot fish of various colors and shapes, and chains of the same type of fish (three or more pieces) disappear when hit by a fish of the same color and type. Types of thrown fish can be changed for convenience. Good luck in conquering the depths of the sea and in repelling the misfortunes of hundreds of marine inhabitants!",
