    "About the game": "We See You is a rhythm based down-scrolling runner where your main character is a pair of eyes trying to avoid various enemies moving in different patterns. Stepping on the same tile as the enemy will result in instant death. Your primary goal is to get as deep as possible, interacting with the randomly generated stage to get points - to eventually die and place yourself on the leaderboard. Key Features Rhythm - everything moves in unison to a heartbeat playing in the background. Your input queues a move for the next beat. Procedural generation - the stage is always 100% randomly generated with a unique experience for each run, with the ability to view and play a specific seed. Pattern assist - to help you figure out the patterns of different enemies, they always show where their next move is and tells you to move out of danger. Powerup items - in the stage there will always be multiple items which, upon use, grants a unique boost to your character. Leaderboard - a fully integrated Steam leaderboard which is viewable in-game. Increasing difficulty - the deeper you go, the harder it gets. There is a hard cap to the difficulty, but even if you reach it, your chances of surviving long are slim. Gamepad support - it's possible to completely re-bind the default controls to a gamepad (xbox, playstation controllers) and the in-game menus are 100% navigatable via re-bindable controls. It can get quite intense .",
