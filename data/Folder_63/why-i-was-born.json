    "About the game": "'At a convenience store late at night, I replace the bag in the trash can outside the store. When I opened the trash lid, the marrow of a fried chicken bone that someone had eaten fell on my shoes In the dark, I was looking at my shoes, stained with grease. Oh, it was over I was already over' This game is a third-person ball action adventure game set in the memory of an ordinary man. Players can have the simulated experience of the man's life by rolling the ball through various stages: the park where he used to play, his school, his room where he lives alone, his part-time job at a store, and his company. Some stages mimic reality, while others are like a scary dream. Family, friends, work and dreams, emptiness and loneliness, society and relationships... The man goes through various experiences and finds the answer that was deep in his heart. The game is divided into an action stage and an adventure stage. There are also puzzle and horror elements. The estimated playing time is 4-5 hours. You can distribute gameplay videos and monetize your distribution without permission. ■Operation Methods Move:WSAD Jump:Space Skill:QW,mouse click Auto save",
