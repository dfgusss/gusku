    "About the game": "Witchhazel Woods is a story-heavy adventure game where you play as Dylan, a teenage girl on a mission to rescue her dog, Georgia. Georgia goes missing during a game of fetch, leaving you alone in the woods with nothing but the twig you had thrown for her. As you journey deeper into the woods, you'll meet an array of animals and...creatures. Every critter has their own story and predicament. Can you find a creature who might have a use for your twig? If so, they might be willing to trade with you for something better. By making the right series of trades, you can help many of the woods' creatures, and find the key to getting Georgia back in the process. Featuring: - 17 tradable characters - A branching narrative - Funny and emotive dialogue with choices that matter - A mixture of hand-drawn pixel art and procedurally generated elements - Original soundtrack - And to answer the all-important question: yes, you can pet the dog.",
