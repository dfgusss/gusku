    "About the game": "You are the last human, abandoned on a zombie infested island. There’s only one thing you must do, escape alive. Scavenge through what remains to acquire weapons and tools to help along the way. Outrun the horde, stay inside at night and discover what horrors led to the island’s downfall. Looting and Scavenging Lucky for you, the population was heavily armed. Weapons and useful tools can be commonly found. However, if you're looking for something better, there are plenty of high-risk/high-reward locations including; A Supermarket, A School, A Gas Station, A Water Treatment Plant, A Power Plant and many more. Day-Night Cycle Make sure to keep an eye on the light. As darkness falls the island becomes ravaged by the hordes of the night. Stay inside where light is plentiful. Vision is important, it’s suicide to try to make it outside blind. The Horde Time is always ticking. A massive horde of infected is on your trail. Stay in one place too long and they will arrive. Military checkpoints The D.O.D in an attempt to contain the infected and help survivors escape set up checkpoints and quarantine zones. Make your way through these zones to get to the bridge and escape. The Titans The D.O.D lost control because of other factors besides the infected. Fear the Desecrator, Fear The Despoiler and Fear The Hive. The Factions Explore what remains of the factions. The D.O.D’s failed attempts to maintain order, the Bandit’s attempt to make a new order, or the mysterious S.L.A.Y organization and their actions. Gladiator mode Test your combat skills in a close quarters, cover-less, post-apocalyptic gladiatorial arena against wave after wave of infected along with other human gladiators. Eclipse mode Night is endless. Hold out in a warehouse against the hordes of the night. Test your building defense skills. See how many seconds you last.",
