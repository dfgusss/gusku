    "About the game": "In the sci-fi RTS game '2089 - Space Divided' you will become the commander of one of three factions. Go into battle for your faction on alien worlds and fight for power and wealth, or maybe just for bare survival. Be smarter than your opponents and secure your dominance on the battlefield. Whether through guerrilla tactics or huge war machinery is your decision. The Andarer are very technically proficient. Discipline and excellence are a must for every young cadet. Sophisticated weapons and strong fortifications make their bases almost impregnable. The Redaxh definitely do not look human. More like insects, ugly insects. The technologies are massively different from the other factions. The weapon systems are incredibly advanced and devastating, but the structures look fragile. Still, you'd better run from their arms. Everything about the Zan seems cobbled together. Weapon systems seem outdated, not made for open combat. On the other hand, they are extremely adept at attacking from ambush and are difficult for the enemy to see. 'A business that only makes money is a bad business.' - Henry Ford Economy : Mines, generators, and hard-working drones are the backbone of your economy. Collect as much crystal, titanium, and energy as possible to keep your war machinery running. No war can be won without a functioning economy. Research : Better to have stronger weapons or faster production? Many fragile outposts or few defensible ones? Your research decisions should always adapt to your tactics. If you are too far behind technologically, you will be inevitable destroyed. Base building : Decide between strongly fortified bases or nomadic existence. Remember that a still standing target is an easy target to hit. Use the possibility to place your buildings freely in the world to occupy strategically useful points for you. Whoever has dominance over the map will win the battle in the long run. Story (Not included in Early Access): It is the year 2089, after the Redaxh visited the planet, society split into those who were friendly to the visitors and those who were not. The Zan split from the Andarers and began to despise everything that was foreign. After a successful assassination attempt on a Redaxh delegation, they declared war on the Old World. Devastating battles developed between the Andarians, Zan and the Redaxh, who each seek only the destruction of the other. Choose one of the three factions and fight for supremacy in story mode.",
