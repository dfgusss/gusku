    "About the game": "Run around hitting people and be rewarded for it! Swing, thrust, dodge, parry, block, push, lead, sneak, cast, burn, freeze, poison, shock, stun, crit, and fail your way through increasingly difficult scenarios as the world adapts to your presence. Items and spells are hidden throughout the procedurally generated world behind locks, recipes, maps, quests, and puzzles. A chest may require information from a distant library to open, magic may require particular circumstances to learn, and nothing remains where it was in the previous playthrough. Pray to the gods and gaze into the Qosmic sky to develop your character with over 80 unique stats that range from simple to ridiculous. Build weapons from scratch using the parts you've discovered - each with its own stats to consider - and balance these parts into the weapon's weight, center of gravity, and resource cost to create something unique to your situation.",
