    "About the game": "Achievement Cage is a game for people who love achievements, who love speedruns, and who love to practice until they get perfect! You play as the little blue guy called 'Rebels' and your objective is to do 100 things in the cage, each corresponding to one achievement. Some of the things you have to do is touch everything, go everywhere, die, find some secret spots, jump everywhere, touch in some random places, amongst others! The movement is so fluid you will die a lot before getting good, but its worth it, i recomend watching the tutorial video tho. The main objective and the way to finish the game is to get the all 100 achievements as fast as possible! Your final time will be submited to a online leaderboard, which you can see in the main menu leaderboard (only the best times show tho). You just want achievements without work? If you want achievements but dont want to play you have an amazing and insanely inovative button for you to click on, you can get all the Achievements this way if you prefer. Features: - Cool 2D pixel art (and cubes); - Fluid movement; - A menu, a nice one; - Online leaderboard with best 10 times; - A button for the lazy achievement collectors; - Actually some Music; -100 Achievements, a value i will increase as soon as i can;",
