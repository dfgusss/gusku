    "About the game": "What if we could bring music to life or navigate an imaginary universe while being transported by a musical composition of one of your favourite artists? Even better: be transported virtually into the imagination of the composers and artists who make us vibrate? This is exactly what the new Asteria experience offers; a true musical journey, in virtual reality mode, through the world of Daniel Bélanger. Presented in many cities in Quebec as early as November 2020, and now via Steam, Asteria offers a unique chance to discover the immersive and exhilarating world of Le Thriomphe d'une Perruche (Triumph of a Parakeet) via the marionettes of Colin St-Cyr Duhamel. This 3DoF 5 minute realtime 360 3D music video is experienced standing still or on a swivel chair and by using headphones with your favourite HMD.",
