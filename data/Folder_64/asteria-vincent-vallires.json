    "About the game": "What if we could bring music to life or navigate an imaginary universe while being transported by a musical composition of one of your favourite artists? Even better: be transported virtually into the imagination of the composers and artists who make us vibrate? This is exactly what the new Asteria experience offers; a true musical journey, in virtual reality mode, through the world of Vincent Vallières. Presented in many cities in Quebec as early as November 2020, and now via Steam, Asteria offers a unique chance to discover the immersive and touching world of Tout N'Est Pas Pour Toujours and Entre Les Étoiles et Toi. This 3DoF 12 minute realtime 360 3D music video is experienced standing still or on a swivel chair and by using headphones with your favourite HMD.",
