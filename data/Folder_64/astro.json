    "About the game": "Astro is a journey going through impossible geometrical worlds. The gameplay is simple : move around, enter doors, pull levers, create portals. Evolve in a surrealistic world and run away from what begs you to stay. The game is fairly short, about two hours to complete the regular mode, but if you're feeling up to it, you can try to complete the hardcore mode. Key Features : A twisted but cute puzzle game from Greewook Studio with the musical stylings of Yann Latour. Challenge your mind with brain teasers. Experience three levels of difficulty. Unique beautifull 4K graphic assets.",
