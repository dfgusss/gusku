    "About the game": "Bark, chase, run, and hide your way to freedom in this psychological/survival horror experience. The Story Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a dog? Their lives seem great from the outside! Sleep in, play with toys, chase squirrels, and bark at cats while never having to work a day or pay a penny of tax in their entire life! But have you ever wondered why they tremble in fear at the shock of loud booms and crashes, force their hackles up and yelp uncontrollably at unsuspected visitors, or cower in utter terror when reprimanded by their owner? Not all dogs live the lives we see on the outside. Play from the perspective of a small, innocent Jack-Russel Terrier living in an abusive household. Maintain your needs and desires to bark, sniff, chase, and find treats, as you try desperately to escape the house in which you have been forced to call home. The Abilities Barking Take full, careful control of your barking and loudly--but cautiously--scare the pesky cats in your near surroundings. Be warned, however, your owner doesn't much care for your woof-ing ways. Barking awards points. You make significant noise when barking. Barking causes your owner and other surrounding threats to become agitated over time. Sensing Tap into your special sixth sense and see the aura of all things you could possibly need. Use 'Sense' to view the aura of guidance and danger. You will automatically start chasing after anyone or anything runs away from your presence; And who doesn't love a good chase? Be warned though, sensing takes a lot of effort. Chasing and marking your territory award points. You cannot bark when sensing. You cannot sense indefinitely. Running and Hiding Your are not a fighter, just a poor little pound pup in a very unsafe environment. Hiding is always the safest solution to danger. You may run fast, but the threats in your life are very smart. Stay low and stay quiet. If they can't hear or see you, you might just get away. You make more noise when running. Threats will often stop to listen for easily detectable sounds such as movement. When a threat stops moving, be still; The slightest movement can give away your location. As threats roam the environment, some hiding places may become too dangerous. Points You are awarded points when barking at cats, holding chases with cats or squirrels, marking your territory, and collecting treats. At the end of each chapter, the points you have collected will result in various boosts to improve your abilities, making the terrors of the world around you a little easier to manage. The Threats Your Owner Your owner doesn't treat you very well. His abuse has led you to escape at the next opportunity you can find, but you know it won't be easy. Until you finally catch your big break, be cautious. Your owner becomes agitated easily by your barking in the night, and if you bark too loud or too often, he will come find you. He has a good ear and an even better eye. Stay quiet and stay hidden as necessary to avoid the abuse and trauma that is yet to come. Neighboring Dogs You may be mighty and fierce, but the bigger dogs around the neighborhood will tear you apart without a second thought. These dogs aren't evoked by your presence, but getting too close or engaging in any act they may deem as challenging will only lead to your demise. Tread carefully when encountering the beasts of nature wandering your near surroundings. Noise Although not a physical threat, sounds may be your worst enemy. Caused by great anxiety and fear, be prepared to fight your conscience as you endure hallucinations and random bursts of involuntary actions. You cannot control how you react to noises in your near surroundings, but the way you handle them can save your life. The Environment The House Trapped in your owner's house without any means of escape, you must try your best to survive three days and three nights. Have as much fun during the day and make as little noise at night as possible or these days will be your last. The Neighborhood The final night, if you manage to survive that long, you can make your escape out into the neighborhood. You are free to roam and explore, but be aware not everywhere is safe. There are dangers unknown to you outside of the environments you are used to. The world out of the cage, you will come to learn, is a horror of its own. Your Choices, Your Story Make your way to one of three endings based on the way you play. Each ending requires differing choices throughout the story, whether you notice them or not. Only one is true. More Info Main Campaign ~ 2-3 Hours Main Campaign + All endings ~ 3-4 Hours Main Campaign + All endings + All extras ~ 10+ Hours",
