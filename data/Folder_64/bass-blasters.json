    "About the game": "Bass blasters is a survival twin sticks shooter that builds levels based on the audio you choose to upload! Choose your favourite .mp3 or .wav and fight your way through the hordes of procedurally spawned enemies to earn a high score. Projectile and enemy spawns vary based on the pitch of the song, as well as the overall volume. Choose a slow soothing song for an easy time, or a hectic energetic song for the true bass blasting experience. Earn score by mowing down enemies. Keep your multiplier up by destroying consecutive enemies without being hit.",
