    "About the game": "You are a thief tasked with burglarizing homes. You are given a list of items required to steal before you can leave. Play with a team and split the prize money or play solo and keep it all for yourself, but it won't be that easy. Boo Men can be lurking in the dark, so stay in the light if you want to survive. This means keeping an eye on the power. The more lights you turn on, the faster it will drain the power and cause a power outage in which case you will need to locate the breaker to turn back on. Take caution -A Boo Man may be hiding in the light, waiting for someone to turn it off... 1-4 Player Online Co-op Play by yourself or up to 4 burglars! The game will adjust itself accordingly based on the number of players! In-game Market What good is stealing money if you have nothing to spend it on? Buy yourself some fancy burglar masks or access to richer houses with larger payouts! 4 Difficulty Options Choose between easy, normal, hard, or insane! Based on the number of players, the game will adjust itself off of the chosen difficulty. Boo Men Each Boo Man behaves differently and any Boo Man can spawn on any map! Replay-ability Different maps, different items, different spawns and different monsters ensures no two rounds are alike!",
