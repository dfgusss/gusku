    "About the game": "BTank is a game in which you need to destroy balls with different properties using projectiles. By scoring points for destroying the balls, you can get extra lives. It can also drop a double projectile, which will help to destroy targets twice as effectively. Balls are of several types. Some fly according to the laws of physics, but some fly by pushing off walls, others fall apart. Everyone needs to find their own approach. Seemingly simple gameplay is actually quite complex. To win, you need attentiveness, dexterity and ingenuity. -Beautiful graphics -Interesting gameplay - Challenging levels",
