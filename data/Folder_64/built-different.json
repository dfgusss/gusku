    "About the game": "A short 3D platformer with a Rich story and a fun gameplay and challenging puzzle --Full controller support ------------------ The Story ------------------ Aldar was a technologist. Like any good technologist in the Proxima Centauri planetary system, he didn’t invent anything himself. Instead, Aldar stole ideas from others and used his massive fortune to hire brilliant technicians and engineers to do the hard work for him. This made him even richer, of course. Over the past thirty years, he created several companies: One sold solar powered hover cars, another used graviton tipped drills to dig massive holes in the planet, and a third sent tens of thousands of satellites into space to create the largest advertising network in the known universe. This made Aldar influential beyond his wildest dreams. Everyone on the planet knew his name. Anything that got in Aldar’s way became an acquisition. As it turned out, almost everyone had their price. New technologies were either absorbed or stifled by his empire, depending on whether or not they fit in with his ‘grand vision’. But there was one thing that Aldar couldn’t buy: His mother’s precious digital painting, ‘The Silly Clown’. The Silly Clown was a TFN - Totally Fungible Nonsense. TFNs were methods of laying claim to pieces of artwork in the least efficient way possible. So even though there were hundreds of thousands of copies of the badly drawn 2D clown picture all over GalacticNet, Aldar’s mother could legitimately say that she owned the original! The creation of The Silly Clown was a complete accident. A digital artist once kept his basic paint program open overnight, and then fell asleep on his writing tablet. As he tossed and turned, his face rubbed over the device. When he woke up in the morning, he was staring at a primitive image of a badly painted clown. Or maybe someone hired a freelance artist to spend four minutes doodling something awful. It’s hard to say. Either way The Silly Clown took GalacticNet by storm. It became the meme of the year. Everyone was reposting their own edited versions of The Silly Clown doing all kinds of activities, hanging in the finest art galleries, and posing next to the biggest stars. But the next year, a driving dog became the next big thing, and The Silly Clown was mostly forgotten. But not by Aldar. He tried every possible legal trick, scam, and even resorted to emotional blackmail in order to try to wrest The Silly Clown from his mother’s hands. She finally got so sick of her own son that she encoded the TFN onto a holographic crystal. Then she built the most heavily guarded, highly automated facility in the world in order to protect it. In her will, she said that The Silly Clown should be immediately destroyed upon her passing, to make sure that her obsessed son didn’t try anything drastic. That meant if Aldar wanted to own the majesty of The Silly Clown… he would need to steal it.",
