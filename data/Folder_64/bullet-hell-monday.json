    "About the game": "Why don't we play a bullet hell shooter? I made it for you who think bullet hell shooters are hard. 'Bullet Hell Monday' is a bullet hell shooter game that’s fun for beginners too. Let's start with a simple stage and gradually get used to bullet hell. Recommended Chapter Mode for bullet hell beginners. Recommended Challenge Mode for bullet hell experts. Chapter Chapter mode is a mode in which you proceed while clearing the missions set for each stage. Each stage is short, and you will be able to advance to the next stage by accomplishing some missions. At first, your craft is weak, but you can level up by using the points you can get for each play. Best suited to the introduction of bullet hell. Starts from a simple stage, so you can gradually improve your skill. Clear the missions set for each stage. Clearing missions opens up new stages. Use the points you earn to upgrade your craft. Challenge Challenge mode is an arcade-style full-scale bullet hell shooter. There are no missions or level-up system like in Chapter mode. After you get used to bullet hell in Chapter mode, try this mode. Experience full-scale arcade-style bullet hell shooter. Select from EASY, NORMAL, HARD, and HEAVEN difficulties.
