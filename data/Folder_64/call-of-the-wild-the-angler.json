Battle a variety of unique species in an authentic and engaging fishing experience.

Master distinct fishing techniques and adapt your strategy to land the most impressive catch. Purchase gear and build custom fishing rigs using a wide selection of rods, reels, lures, hooks, floats, and jigheads. Create your angler and customize their look and attributes.

Meet fellow anglers, explore the open world in a shared vehicle or boat, and go on unforgettable fishing expeditions together. You can also play on your own or in offline mode for an even more peaceful experience.
