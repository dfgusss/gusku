    "About the game": "CashGrab is a physics based multiplayer survival horror game for 2-8 people. Run and hide, or hunt and chase. Get caught? Dead players can use cameras to utilize a variety of traps as they see fit. All that matters is that you grab the cash, and get out. Features - (Destructible map) - (Big Mode) - (Prox Chat) - (Bust Down) - (Pause Menu) - (Server Browser) - (Over 49 cash spawn locations) - (Original Soundtrack) Gameplay Players at the beginning of the match are randomly assigned as either a 'Grabber' or the 'Monster'. Those who are selected as the Grabbers must find and collect all of the cash, while the monster attempts to hunt them down. Both the Grabbers and the Monster are given a variety of abilities and options. After a Grabber has been killed, they will take control of a network of cameras throughout the map which control a variety of traps. The game ends after all Grabbers have escaped or been killed, or until the timer runs out.",
