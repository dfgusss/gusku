    "About the game": "Closed Island is a classic RPG. Emmeline, a young graduate of the school of magic, is waiting for her first real test: frightening rumors come from the distant Mareon about monstrous monsters and rising undead. And as it turns out, those rumors were true... Many residents have fled their homes, hoping to find salvation, and the few who remain speak of terrible things happening all over the island. This test will not be easy... Help young sorceress Emmeline overcome her first real test! Fight hordes of monstrous monsters as you roam the cursed island of Mareon, where danger can lurk at every turn! You have to embark on a long and dangerous path, step by step clearing the cursed island from evil. And she will be helped in this by witchcraft and the remaining daredevils, ready to share supplies or valuable information. And yet, more than once she will have to risk her life... - Complete the quest chain; - Collect coins and upgrade Emmeline's abilities; - Kill monsters and free the island from evil! The player gets under his control a character who explores the location. On his way there are obstacles in the form of opponents (monsters) of varying degrees of complexity. By destroying opponents and collecting valuable items (coins), the player can improve the characteristics of his character. The goal of the game is to clear the island of monsters and complete the quest chain. And remember: the legions of the undead will do everything they can to stop you. Head to Mareon, and don't forget to take your magic gear with you!",
