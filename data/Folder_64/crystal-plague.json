    "About the game": "This world is dying. Crystal plague, made by the Alchemist, is devouring the living. Weakened gods summon last non-plagued souls to gather the strength and destroy the Alchemist to save all that's left of the world. Your reward is your any wish. But the Alchemist knows this. The task is simple, even mundane: complete the quest of the gods, gather enough magical power to help gods get rid of the Alchemist. Use different souls to be more effective when completing the quest. Gods help you with gifts - runes and soul improvement. But the Alchemist wont wait for you to finish him - he will curse you and plague you with monsters. Obtain the runes left for you by the gods - they will change your powers in different combinations. Upgrade your perks during the game and get stronger, faster, deadlier. The Alchemist will curse you and you will have to choose what curse to suffer from.",
