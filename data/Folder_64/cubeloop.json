    "About the game": "CubeLoop is a first-person puzzle game that you can play alone or cooperatively online. Find out what riddle the room hides and escape or die trying. Online cooperation All rooms can be played collaboratively. Call your Steam friends and let the fun begin. Solve logic-based puzzles All puzzles are randomly generated using an algorithm that ensures they can be solved logically. And don't worry. All games are replayable and are meant to be completed in multiplayer or single player. Enjoy the mysterious setting . In CubeLoop you are condemned to live in an infinite Loop and the only escape from reality is a slide that seems to be connected to the paintings adorning the walls of your cell. Entertainment will cost you dearly as every mistake can cost you your life... and something that will hurt you more than your life. Getting your bearings won't be easy as all the levels are mazes that will try to rob you of what little sanity you have left. No distractions No interface, no menus, everything is integrated into the game. CubeLoop is a completely immersive game, where only cold logic can save you.",
