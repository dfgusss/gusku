    "About the game": "Discvivors is a timed survival, bullet hell, roguelite game which grows more and more intense over time each run. Enemies become more numerous, more varied, faster, do more damage, have more health, and their projectiles also move faster. One of the things that sets Discvivors apart from many similar games is it's focus on more of an RPG style of progression vs reliance on random drops/unlocks each run. The game consists of several classes which each have a primary and secondary weapon/skill. When selecting your class, you can also purchase upgrades for Gold (dropped from enemies) which are permanent and can improve the power and effects of both primary and secondary weapons/skills. These upgrades are unique to each class and consist of things like more projectiles, more damage, faster attacks, larger projectiles, increased procs &amp; bonus effects, etc. Along with the permanent upgrades, as you play through each run and gain experience you will gain levels. Each level up allows you to pick from temporary (until the end of the current run) upgrades to things such as move speed, attack speed of your primary attack, damage of your primary attack, armor, health, healing amount, and pickup radius of items. All of these options are available at each level up, no RNG, so you have the freedom to build to your desired playstyle each run, and there are currently no limits on the amount of points you can put into each of these upgrades. You may start out feeling slow and weak, but over the course of the first few runs you will begin collecting enough gold to purchase your first few permanent upgrades for the class you want to play and progress further and further each run. Progressing further means more gold and more upgrades. Continue growing stronger over time and unleash arrow, axe, dagger, fireball, and holy hell on your enemies!",
