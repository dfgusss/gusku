It is a world where technology is being abused and the citizens are being controlled by thought from birth. What's real is uncertain. The population's perception of reality is being controlled unknowingly by FA Corporation. Rumor has been said this is being done using a form of artificial neural implants initiated at birth. The implants are controlled by FA Corp's main data servers to control the significant actions taken by individuals. 'Free will' and 'liberty' have been engineered and distributed at scale to the masses. These actions effect everything from political, career and financial decisions throughout the implant sector of society. Uncover the secrets of FA Corporation's 'Thought Program' and destroy their central data network located in the highly secured corporate headquarters.
