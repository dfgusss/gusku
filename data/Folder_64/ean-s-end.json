    "About the game": "This is the first work (with the intention of giving it a try) of our family team. I'm in charge of the game's content and story design, my wife did the programming, and all the art elements you see are the work of my cousin who was still in college sacrificed a summer vacation. So the game looks very, very, very simple. However, I added a lot of rougelike design elements in the story. I like rougelike very much. I often think that if an adventure story can be combined with rougelike, our protagonist will feel like God is throwing dice. So the ending of the game and the easter eggs that can be triggered are quite a lot (the kind that racked my brains). All you need to play this game is a single-click mouse, you'll know where to click, make a choice and just click. We're really looking forward to someone discovering all the endings and easter eggs in this game. Thanks to everyone who would like to experience our first family product.",
