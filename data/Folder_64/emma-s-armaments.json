    "About the game": "Our father has disappeared, leaving us with a huge debt! The only way to pay this back is to successfully run the store! Emma collects and refines items in the dungeon, and Caro sells them at a high price! Let's help the two manage the store successfully! ●Game Flow ・ Go to the dungeon and defeat monsters. You can get items by defeating monsters. You can 'Sell' items or use them for 'Alchemy,' in which two or more items are combined to create a new item. ・ If you run low on energy during a dungeon, press the [Return] button to go home. You can bring back the items you acquired in the dungeon. Note that you cannot bring back items if your energy reaches 0. ・ Items can be refined through alchemy to make them even more powerful and valuable. Since powerful items make dungeon conquests much easier, be proactive about refining items. ・ Items and monsters have attributes. There are four attributes: None, Fire, Grass, and Water. The none attribute has no particular effect, but fire is strong against grass, grass is strong against water, and water is strong against fire. Properly accounting for attribute compatibility increases attack power and decreases damage received, so be mindful about the attributes of items you equip. ・ The game is cleared when all dungeons are traversed and liberated, and finally when the asset reaches 10 million gold.",
