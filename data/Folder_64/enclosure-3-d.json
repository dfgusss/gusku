    "About the game": "Story You play as Mike Goodman, a small-time con man who, after yet another night of bad business, gets an offer he just can't refuse. The next day you find yourself joining a party of 10 professionals embarking on a mission to uncover the secrets of an abandoned arctic base. Gameplay Enclosure is a text-parser graphic adventure game inspired by classics of the genre and horror movies of the 80s. You control Mike by moving him around and issuing commands via keyboard. You explore and interact with the environment, talk to your fellow party members and solve adventure game-style puzzles on the way. Enclosure 3-D is a modern remaster of the game Enclosure originally released in 2004. The graphics have been remodeled in 3D while preserving the pixel art look of the game, and a completely new soundtrack has been composed. You can switch between original and remastered graphics by using F2 in the game. Controls move Mike using arrow keys or the numpad (tap to move/stop) type in text commands ('look', 'open door' etc.) Enter to progress dialog Escape to open menu F11 for fullscreen Tips Talk - talk to all characters until you've exhausted their conversations (F3) Observe - ask Mike to look at anything that stands out Explore - walk inside and outside the station to discover all the locations",
