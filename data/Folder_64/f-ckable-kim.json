    "About the game": "In this 2D fighting game you have to save the humanity from a cruel, ruthless, bloody dictator aspiring to the world hegemony. After a president of the great, free, democratic, and peaceful America — Mr. Donya — received a threat from F*ckable Kim — a dictator of a distant kingdom called Nastychickea, he sent a secret agent there. When the secret agent found out the location of an enemy’s nuclear weapons factory, he sneaked into the factory and defeated the guards. After taking over the enemy’s factory, the secret agent sneaked into F*ckable Kim’s lair and fought him. This game combines the fighting and visual novel genres: the story alternates with fights where the hand-to-hand combat is simulated by a few characters within an arena. Fighting as various characters against various opponents, find out how the confrontation with the cruel dictator will end.",
