    "About the game": "If life and the world are based on luck, I hope it will be a more positive experience. Even if this city we live in is cold and dark. I believe that if you lead us prudently and strategically in this turn-based city, you can achieve such an positive about luck. And our team count on you.  -Team Goetita Features Separated damage system - Unlike other turn-based strategy games, fixed damage and random damage are separate. Sight-based movement  - In a battle of life and death, humans are not in a hurry to step out of sight. First, the unit check the sight and then move the position.  Maintenance cost  - Consuming resources while moving is similar to other survival games. But they are in a city. So only there is money. Assassination - When the alarm does not sound, the enemy will spread. But if the alarm sounds and feels attacked, the enemy will unite and fight. 16:9 16:10 supports resolution.",
