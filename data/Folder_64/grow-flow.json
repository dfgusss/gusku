A game where going fast feels good, and being accurate is key. The safe way might not be the fun way, and there's always a faster route waiting to be found. Explore many different art styles inspired by european avant-gardes from the beginning of the twentieth century! Interact with Cubes to make your path to the end of the levels! Enter Zones (or avoid them) because you can, and you want to (or because you have to)! Grow Flow contains: Over 60 levels, divided between 7 chapters! In-game save system! Fully voice-acted goddess! Hidden and optional mechanics! Beautiful soundtrack! Secrets?",
