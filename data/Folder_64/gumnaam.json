    "About the game": "SYNOPSIS Memory is the backbone of all the past and all reality. But what happens when everyone suddenly seems to forget about the name and existence of a village? Moreover, even though people tend to forget the place, it still exists and does what it does. There are multiple missing cases in the area. You are a police officer in charge of solving this mystery. In search of evidence, you mysteriously became one of the victims, entered and lost in an unnamed village. There is no hope of help from outside, from the ones whose memory has probably been manipulated to believe that you never existed. Nevertheless, You have to complete your duty of discovering the pieces of evidence from this village and then escape this village by doing a ritual. You never know, what's true, what's false, what happened in the past, or what is just a myth. But one thing is obvious, you are being watched. While the enigmatic creatures chase you, she watches you all the time with a smile, relishing it as if it's hide-an-seek. Creatures are just another supernatural manipulation of reality, protecting the secrecy of this forgotten bloody playground. FEATURES Authentic Survival Horror Experience Your enemy is an invincible, mysterious, and supernatural being. You can't fight it. If you want to survive, running and hiding are your only options. Interactive tools: You can pick and interact with tools and devices like keys, locks, a camera, a torch, a flashlight, drawers, cabinets, candles, physical objects, paper, etc. Shreds of evidence: There are six papers with some childish yet spooky drawings relevant to solving the mystery. Collect them all. Ritual Objects: 6 children-toys are in different places in the village. You must pick them all and place them correctly in the ritual spot in order to escape. Jump Scares: Be careful. You never know when you are face to face with her. Monsters: Two monsters always guard the place. They will chase you if they see you. The only way to avoid being caught by them is to run and hide. If you get caught, they will impair you and eventually kill you, just like all the other explorers who tried to escape the village. Desi Environment: Fresh take on the horror environment can be found in the game. The environment is based in an Indian Village.",
