    "About the game": "Stranded in another solar system on a confusing planet, you must source fuel for your ship. You'll learn how to research, build and defend in increasingly hostile scenarios across the planet. Hive tasks you with mastering three components of colonisation: - Agriculture: providing food to your structures to boost their productivity, - Industry: mining resources and refining them, - Defence: preventing your thin walls from being torn down by local inhabitants with several creative solutions. To get off the planet you must capture and extract from local hives and harvest crystals from deep within them. Liquefy these crystals directly into fuel and say goodbye. The mites won't miss you. Research, Build, Expand, Extract Starting with only a few resources, your objective is to amass materials so you can develop further technologies and reach the hives. Once alerted, hives will launch constant attacks at your expense with a variety of enemies, some of which have evolved to be more unique than others. In the forest, a Hive Queen might cocoon on death, producing smaller enemies until you can destroy it. On another, it will rip the ground beneath you causing eruptions of resources and spikes preventing you from building there again. The more of them you kill, the stronger they get. Best get it done quickly... A variety of solutions You can conquer these lands violently or quietly but you'll have to get your hands dirty no matter what. Deploy web towers to trap your enemies and significantly slow them down so your arrows can flatten their ambitions, or pursue defence research 'in the name of science' and unleash a harsh cloud of smoke knocking hives unconscious and killing almost all creatures in an extremely wide radius. There are multiple ways to approach local domination. Speed things up Feeling slow? Speed up the game to 2x or 3x to get the fight going, and if that isn't enough, research Agriculture to produce various crops capable of boosting structure productivity, getting you those resources you so desperately need that much quicker. Just be careful not to underestimate the mites... DISCLAIMER FOR LINUX &amp; MAC USERS I plan to support Linux. Questions or Feedback? Please post in the discussion forms!",
