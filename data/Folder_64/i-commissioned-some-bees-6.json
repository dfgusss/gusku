    "About the game": "A hidden object game where you must find all the bees to complete each level. Key features: ⁍ 1000+ bees ⁍ 10 unique artworks ⁍ Unlimited hints if you get stuck ⁍ Restore a small number of bees to a painting so you can find them again! ⁍ Additional bee related objects to find ⁍ Music and ambiance for each artwork ⁍ Achievements ⁍ Use your keyboard to move/zoom in if you have no scrollwheel ⁍ 3 save slots ⁍ Reset progress entirely and play again ⁍ Timer included to show how long you took to complete each level Context: The brief was simple. I commissioned artists to create a fantasy world, and hide as many bees as they can inside it. Now it’s your job to find them all! With 10 art pieces to choose from, and 1000+ bees, you will have a lot of searching to do. Controls: Use your mouse to move around the image and zoom in / out. When you find a bee, click it and it will disappear. You can also use WASD to move and the arrow keys to zoom. Difficulty: A full range of difficulty is included, but all levels start unlocked, your progress is saved as you play, and you can use hints if you get stuck. Get immersed: Each painting has its own music and ambiance to help you connect with the world, as you search for all the bees. Replayable You can restore a small number of bees back into a painting so you can find them again! It’s much harder when there are only a few bees left (especially randomly). You can also use up to 3 save slots so you can replay without progress loss. Alternatively, you can reset your progress for the entire game if you’d like to start over.",
