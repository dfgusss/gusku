    "About the game": "INCISION is a brutal, fast, merciless blast from the past inspired by the godfathers of the first person shooter genre such as Doom, Quake, Blood, Shadow Warrior. INCISION offers an experience that demands skill and focus from its player, and rewards them with intense carnage that will paint the town red. Yours is a simple job. Cut, shoot, burn and decimate it all to stop the spread of the Growth. Mercy is weakness. Hesitation is death. INCISION is designed to be merciless in its difficulty, but the player will never feel weak in the face of danger. Your arsenal is varied, powerful, loud, and will easily turn enemies into sticky red puddles, as long as they don't first do it to you. Movement is fast and responsive; story never gets in the way of the gameplay. WALKING ARSENAL Eight weapons of mass-slaughter, all including powerful alternative firing modes. Fire a volley of bouncing incendiary bombs out of your shotgun. Lob grenades from your heavy machine gun to turn your foes into red mist. Do tricks with your trusty revolver to maximize its damage output. Spray a volley of four incendiary rockets and watch even the strongest foe crumble into ashes before you. Go berserk with a saw-spear that works as a long-range slashing weapon or as a close-range buzzsaw. PULSATING NIGHTMARESCAPE The world of INCISION has been transformed into a living nightmare where a ever-consuming, ever-growing mass of flesh and machine live in unholy symbiosis. All we hold familiar and comfortable has been turned into a network of hellish, rusty, pulsating labyrinthian series of factories that serve as the nerves and organs for some greater being that only seeks to merge, unite and grow. HELL PATROL The Growth has merged and united all life on the planet, turning its people into machine-freaks, all of them designed to turn anyone who opposes their regime inside-out. Augmented soldiers with burst-firing energy rifles, mad sycophants with ricocheting sawblades, machine spider-priests aka. 'Spiderpopes' with homing missiles. INCISION's roster of monsters will keep you on your toes til the bloody end. HEAD-BANGING &amp; SKULL-RATTLING INCISION includes a soundtrack by JM and Frédérick Chicoine 'iNi'; An entire album's worth of atmospheric horror ambience and mayhem-inducing metal that will burst your veins with adrenaline. INCISION is coming to Early Access VERY SOON. Stay tuned.",
