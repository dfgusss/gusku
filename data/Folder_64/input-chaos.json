    "About the game": "Input Chaos is a physics based multiplayer fighting game. FEATURES : All moves are your sticks moves. Nervous ragdolls with brutal weapons. Cinematic slow motions. Aggressive AIs designed to ignore mercy. NOTES : Development is still ongoing. Future improvements and funny bugs are expected. The controls of the game can be surprising. Please try the demo first. No dedicated online multiplayer. (for now, you can try steam's 'remote play together', not tested.) Controllers/Gamepads only. (you need the dual sticks)",
