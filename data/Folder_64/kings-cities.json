Make your choices wisely, because if one of them falls to 0, it is the end of your leadership on Epeiros. ◦ Leader's quests During your games, the ruler of your kingdom will send you quests. Complete them to obtain favors. ◦ Diplomacy Relations with other kingdoms and empires fluctuate depending on your actions. Find powerful allies to help you but beware! Times are hard and betrayals are common. ◦ Cultures &amp; Religions The factions of Kings&amp;Cities are separated into 5 cultures and 6 religions offering great replayability.",
