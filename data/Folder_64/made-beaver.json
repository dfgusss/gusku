    "About the game": "Made Beaver is an 18th century fur trade simulator and inventory manager. Starting with a small cabin on the coast, the objective is to build a profitable trading network across the continent of North America. Primary gameplay takes place within the Trade window, buying and selling goods and furs with hundreds of tribes, settlements, and freemen. - Trade imported goods for furs that will later be auctioned back home. The markets can be unpredictable so plan for the worst and hope for the best. - Manage your reputation with the tribes while also trading with their enemies. - Upgrade to larger forts for larger trading capacities and stronger defenses against tribes with low reputation. - Unlock double profit goods from China and the Sandwich Islands for settlements. - Unlock the Panama Trail to shave months off transoceanic shipping times. - Play as Canada, France, Great Britain, Netherlands, Russia, Spain, Sweden, or United States. Some dev background: Made Beaver is a solo development effort by a new pc game developer and the principal goal is historical accuracy. Hundreds of hours of research were committed to all aspects of the game world: - Trade routes and travel times - Goods and prices - Shipping costs - Wildlife ranges and populations - Tribe territories and populations - Settlement locations and populations Development is ongoing to refine details, correct errors, and improve player experience.",
