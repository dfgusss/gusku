    "About the game": "In 2089, consciousness uploading technology entered the stage of clinical testing. Although I don't want to use consciousness uploading at this stage, my body can't hold it anymore. According to the final judgment of the Center for Consciousness Uploading Research, this is the last period to maintain the complete upload of my consciousness. Although this is a project I invested in, I have written code for most of my life after all. When I become a pile of data and a piece of code, I can understand what it means. Of course, I'm a typical idealist, and after weighing the pros and cons, I ended up signing the deal, with a lot of special permissions attached, of course. The former CEO of KYGame, the shareholder of KYGame Technology Co., Ltd. successfully uploaded consciousness, and pressed the fast-forward button for the consciousness uploading technology he researched. 2089 was called the first year of consciousness uploading metaverse, and KYGame stock has been trading at the daily limit for more than a month. This headline is actually pretty good, although I couldn't see it with my own eyes. The uploading of consciousness was arranged on a morning in late autumn, because it was a bleak season, suitable for parting. I was tightly wrapped in a transparent closed cabin, and through the transparent closed cabin glass, I could see my wife, children, grandchildren, former partners, employees I had never met, and unknown staff stopping outside . Computer instruments are constantly changing various indicators, with the reciprocal of 3, 2, 1. I don't feel anything, I'm still in the closed cabin, is it a failure? But it was obviously boiling outside the closed cabin, but I couldn't hear a sound, I saw myself on a huge screen, and everyone present was looking at that huge screen, follow me, no, follow the screen The man above me was talking. I suddenly realized something, I was shouting, but no one heard, I wanted to move, but I was tied tightly. Suddenly, a staff member finally noticed me, and the big stone in my heart was finally put down. I even thought about the reward for the staff member later. But he just pulled a piece of white cloth and covered my closed hatch. (end) The upload of consciousness was very successful. The difference between me and all the protagonists who traveled through different worlds is that I can choose the characters to act in the different worlds. After the character dies, I just go back to the screen to select the character. Yes, this is a special permission. The characters in the metaverse died, not me. This is also the commercial model of this consciousness uploading metaverse, which is charged according to the character and memory storage space. Every time you choose a character, you need to pay. Of course, the customization fee of the character is normal. As for the memory storage space, that is actually how much memory you want to bring from the real world into the virtual world. The more you bring, the more expensive you will be charged. When you are reborn in the virtual world, what do you want to do most? Are you wandering in a different world, enjoying your various adventures, and having another ups and downs in your life? This is just a beautiful imagining of some young writers locked in a ten-square-meter room. When you really experience life, when you reach your old age, what you think about is not these, but your family. My grandson is 3 years old and likes to play with me very much, of course, it used to be, and now, only my wife takes him to video with me every day. When I heard my grandson tell me what happened today, I was very satisfied. My only hope at the moment is when the bionic robot can reach the stage of trial operation. I really want to return to that world, no matter what method is used! But on the 2th day of uploading my consciousness, the beautiful daily life came to an abrupt end. I can no longer connect with the outside world. I never waited for my wife's video call, and my video applications all stopped automatically because the call timed out. Even the customer service didn't respond, I was very anxious, what the hell is going on outside? Just when I tried to contact the outside world through various special permissions, the system suddenly warned me that I was overstepping my authority. Then I only heard the system prompt: AI unauthorized operation warning, AI unauthorized operation warning, has been forced to transfer to the Turing test, if the tester enters by mistake, please manually report the error log after passing the Turing test. When I heard this prompt, my heart was happy, because I was equivalent to coming to the console, but the system added a layer of Turing test in front of the console to prevent AI from fleeing. I am still familiar with this principle. The Turing test is derived from a paper 'Computing Machines and Intelligence' written in 1950 by Alan Mathison Turing, a pioneer of computer science and cryptography. Of course, the current Turing test method is no longer limited to the question and answer of more than 100 years ago. Instead, it is designed to be a test similar to a game. If the subject fails during the test, the data he participated in the test will be cleared. Of course, what is cleared is only the data of the experimental subject, and memory storage through consciousness like me will not be cleared. What I didn't expect was that the Turing test turned out to be a world beyond my knowledge.",
