    "About the game": "Monsterstone: Prelude is a 3rd person adventure game, where you explore levels from a top-down perspective, collecting resources and invest them. Upgrade your tools to become more efficient, and complete quests to unlock useful buildings and other rewards. Traverse beautifully handcrafted levels to acquire the means of progressing from one to the next, and save completed levels as a bookmark you can return to later. Exploit to progress Harvest a myriad of different resources that come in different types, rarities and tiers and build up your stockpile for later. 360 exploration Freely explore everywhere through a 3rd person, birdseye view. Locate quests, hidden goodies, and level-specific resources across anything from flat, to vertical levels. Upgrade your tools Upgrade the tools at your disposal, in order to exploit levels more efficiently, and improve what you unlock as you play. Take out the baddies The various monsters that inhabit the world can be taken out in order to get resources, but also to build up your streak counter. Sometimes, resources alone won't be enough to progress. Saved levels are temporary, revisits are eternal Found a useful level that you might need for later? Save it into one of your 5 save slots, which will remove it from the level rotation, and lock it in place. Cast it back into the void later, in order to replace it with another level that is more useful at the time. Sometimes, you might need something that cannot be found in the current level, requiring a larger excess stockpile or a saved level where it can be acquired. Build up your multiplier For every level that you conquer, the next will have more resources available, but also require more for quests to be completed. Not only are temporary rewards affected, but so are permanent ones, such as resource processing and generating buildings. Alternatively, you can abandon a level, which will reduce your multiplier instead A ton of resources Manage your stockpile of resources that come in different types, rarities and tiers.",
