    "About the game": "This is a retro-style 2D platformer with suspenseful elements. You must find the way out of this cave without getting caught by the monsters and traps that appear unexpectedly with each new level. Main objective is to share a little about the sensations experienced by a person suffering from panic and anxiety disorders as a form of empathy and awareness (based on my personal experience). Easy to control It's better to look around! Agility and precision Checkpoint System Features There are 20 levels with different enemy and trap combinations Each level has a timer to record your best times Torches are used as checkpoints to help you out Special effects of lights and cameras Alternate controls (using WASD or Arrows) Two types of jumps: normal and double Various enemies with different moves Beware what comes from the darkness, there are hidden traps !",
