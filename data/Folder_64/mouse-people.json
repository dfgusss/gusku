    "About the game": "Mouse people is an experiential commercial game. Please use your mouse to click, drag and destroy people and things. Be chill , face up to your your own thoughts. We have a little plot about 20 to 30 minutes, and an endless mode. Gameplay You can throw away lots of things. From a Band-Aid which can cure your broken-heart, discarded job resumes, cars in traffic jams, crazy taffic lights and even your own mind. This game is easy to controll. You just need to control the character (or the mouse) to click on the item, press and release it. There is no text in the game. I used a rather vague expression, because I also wanna understand your thoughts, and share some stories with other players. Even dialog can be thrown away. About the developers The progress of making this game includes my chaos, excitement and patience. This is Liujiajun and it's my fifth game on Steam. I hope you love my game. At last, Thanks for playing my game. Do you want to get the newest information about ? Please follow our Discord. Discord: [/url",
