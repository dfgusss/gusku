    "About the game": "Resurrection of Authentic Action RPG With a long history, the planet ‘Uld’ was a dark age when wars between kingdoms were frequent until just 150 years ago. As time passed, the war died down and all records disappeared, leaving the Dark Ages a myth that was passed down orally. Currently, humans, elves, and Gremlin tribes are living in kingdoms and cities with little history. There was little left intact from the Dark Ages, but they interacted together, flourished, and rebuilt the ‘Uld’. However, there are many life-threatening risks to the reconstruction of the ‘Uld’ due to the undeterred 'Discordia' race, which is raging cruelly beyond the city's precarious walls. Ambitious adventurers venture to acquire many treasures and mysterious hard-working artifacts known to be in ruins or dungeons despite these dangers. With a dream of making quick money and hope of discovering artifacts with the power to rebuild the ‘Uld’. Welcome to the dynamic adventure of becoming a god on the planet ‘Uld’.
