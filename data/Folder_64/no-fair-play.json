    "About the game": "An anti-game : No Fair Play is a 'Freefight Football' game where you can beat your opponents using a nonstandard way. A member of the opposing team has a good dribbling skills ? Aim for the legs ! Punch, push, tackle, grab ... it's up to you to choose how you get the upper hand on your opponent. You can still have fun while loosing with the rage mode and even change the outcome of the game. Multiplayer and Bots : Start a game with bots, end it with real players. You can allow other player to join your game and takes the place of the bot. If someone leaves/disconnects, a bot takes his place immediately. Based on physics : Ragdolls, ball control, player interactions … physics gives players more opportunities to have fun with unexpected situations. Intuitive gameplay : Simple controls, simple rules, just focus on having fun with your friends. The ball goes where you aim at, but simple gameplay doesn't mean limited gameplay. Skilled players will disable the assist system to push the gameplay farther. Customisable character : Choose your cut, your clothes, your colors and join the field. About me : I’m just a self-taught developer, maybe more a gamer, who uses all help he could find on internet for this game. I would like to thank all these people for giving me this opportunity.",
