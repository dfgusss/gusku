    "About the game": "Nutty Motorcars is a classic video game with a new point of view. Up to 4 players on a single screen can battle it out in these crazy races. Jumps, bridges, tunnels and many more obstacles. Throw your enemies giant hammers, mines, sweep them with dynamite, or just collide with them to make them lose time. Avoid going off the road and slippery areas. Use the turbo to overtake your opponents and repair your car by collecting power-ups. Discover the 30 circuits available in the full version and race on them with 20 different vehicles. Note: You can play the game with the keyboard, but to play multiplayer local you need an aditional controller.",
