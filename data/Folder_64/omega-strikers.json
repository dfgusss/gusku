    "About the game": "Omega Strikers is a 3v3 competitive game where the objective is to knock out opponents and score goals against the enemy team using explosive attacks and abilities. Matches are fast and intense—the first team to get five goals wins, and you must get at least two points ahead to secure a victory. Omega Strikers has an ever-growing roster of unique and powerful Strikers, each of which can be unlocked through normal play. 3v3 unranked, ranked, and private lobbies across a handful of maps are available from day one, with more maps and modes planned. For those looking to dive deeper into the game, cosmetic purchases and battle passes are available via in-app purchase. Always Free-to-Play, Never Pay-to-Win In Omega Strikers, only smarts and skills will earn victory. There are no loot boxes, no consumable power boosts, and no competitive advantages for spenders. All characters can be unlocked through regular play. Compete Your Way Queue solo or squad up with friends and fight your way up the ranked ladder to become a champion—or use custom matches to challenge your rivals. Play Anywhere Party up cross-platform with friends and take your progress anywhere with cross-progression as Omega Strikers rolls out across PC and mobile platforms. Big Seasonal Updates Omega Strikers will continually evolve as each new season adds new Strikers, additional stages, fresh unlockables, and more ways to play.
