    "About the game": "Onsen Master is a hot spring customer management game where players must revitalize various hot springs across the fantasy island of Izajima! Create ingredients to match the various customer ailments, reconnect the communities that surround each onsen, and discover the supernatural world that they've long since been disconnected from. Dive into a 1-2 player story mode, or take on others in a competitive couch multiplayer mode where you must each work to manage your customers within the same hot spring. Short and sweet single-player story across 6 hot spring levels! Unveil the island of Izajima in a visual novel style narrative with a cute anime aesthetic! Skip the story and dive right in with Arcade Mode. Take on others in a competitive 2-player local multiplayer. An original soundtrack full of tunes akin to a Feudal fairytale, composed by Dorrell Ettienne. Supports Xbox and PS4 controllers. STORY MODE A dark cloud has sprung over the island of Izajima and its effects weigh heavily on the inhabitants. To top things off, mischievous spirits called yokai have returned and are running amok within the various hot springs. As Mu, you've been tasked with filling the shoes of your now missing sensei, the great 'Onsen Master'. It is now up to you to restore the balance and uncover what happened to the previous master.",
