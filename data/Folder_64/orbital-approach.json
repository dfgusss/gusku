    "About the game": "Orbital Approach combines the classic slingshot puzzle formula with a space-themed twist. Progress through the 85 levels found within to achieve the greatest high scores, overcome new obstacles, and discover new ways to outthink the rules of gravity as you make your approach to the goal. The game takes inspiration from titles such as Angry Birds, Golf It!, and a number of other casual, physics-based puzzle games. It contains a variety of precisely constructed levels to test the player's ability to both use the tools at their disposal and to think outside the box. Not every level has an obvious solution, and some will require the player to think of new ways to take their ship into orbit. Orbital Approach features a host of obstacles, ranging from simple planets of various sizes to pull the player around, to more complex objects like black holes that use normalized gravity fields, even triggers that can toggle objects on and off, ensuring that some stages may not be exactly what they appear to be. It's up to the player to experiment and find new ways to fly through space, all while racking up a high score to top the leaderboard. The path you choose is up to you, which direction will you take?",
