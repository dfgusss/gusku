    "About the game": "You are Markun, a member of the villainous Eraser species, who for years worked in the shadows to manipulate the Pens and Springs into never-ending war. Markun has been willfully oblivious to most of her kind's more vile acts in the past due to never being in the front lines... but that's about to change. Commando El Stupido, the ruthless leader of the Erasers and Corporal Rindax, your superior, have devised a scheme they believe will lead the Erasers to victory and the Pens and Springs to ruin. For the first time ever, Markun is being sent out into the field... and what happens next will change the tides of war. Thrilling story chapters! Platform through eight exciting levels, blasting enemies, solving light puzzles and experiencing the twisting and turning story as Markun finds her place within it. An action-filled tale awaits! Deadly boss battles! Avoid the powerful and wildly varied attacks of eight dangerous unique foes that will stop at nothing to stop you in your tracks. Powerful weapons! Blast enemies to bits with seven unique weapons, ranging from a humble Punch, to the gut-busting Shotgun, to the devastating Maelstrom! Lavishly smooth animations! All characters and creatures are meticulously and smoothly animated, breathing life into the game's comic/cartoon aesthetics! What happens when a villain realizes just how bad they really are?",
