    "About the game": "Put on Your Thinking Cap Each level is designed as a short puzzle: how do you go about acquiring your powers and then how do you use them to reach the goal? Powers are always reset at the beginning of a level, and not all of them are always available, so each level has you working in a new way. Six Powers Jump, dash, pound, shoot lasers, turn invisible (and invulnerable), and slow down objects to achieve victory. Single Player or Co-op There are 20 one-player levels, and 20 more two-player levels, for approximately 5 hours of gameplay. In co-op, you get just as many powers as in single player, so you have to share these powers between yourselves in order to reach the goal. Your Own Disq Players can choose between eight colours and eight accessories to customise their character, an amicable individual named Disq. Precision Is Key You can plan your way through a stage, or figure it out through trial and error. Either way, hitting a hazard resets the level. This game is best played by people who are patient and dedicated to success! A practice stage is available if you want to work on a particular motion in a safe environment.",
