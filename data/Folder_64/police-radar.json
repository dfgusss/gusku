Your mission in this simulator is to stop the cars that exceed the speed limit and check the driver database for violations. This is the only way we will be able to detect those who break the law. Thus, by doing these checks, you will be able to issue fines or even arrest if there are more serious violations. Don't let anyone go unpunished, even if you need to use the spike. This is the only way we will create respect for the law. Watch out! Game Features : - Ways to stop the cars ( Spike,Pull over) - Checking the Driver`s Database (Let Go,Fine,Arrest) - Garage with 6 Police cars",
