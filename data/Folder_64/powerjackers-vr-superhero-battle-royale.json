    "About the game": "Powerjackers - VR Superhero Battle Royale is a multiplayer first-person shooter, where you start with one 'travel' superpower, and one 'miscellaneous' superpower, and attempt to be the last man (or woman) standing, as you fly, web-sling, or speed-run through the city. As you kill your opponents, you will gain any superpowers they had already gained. Feel the freedom of going anywhere in the city with web-slinging and flight. As the game is also VR enabled, it might make it easier to transfer the superpowers to your dreams at night, if you are anything like me. Play either against bots on your own computer, or against real people via LAN or the internet. As well as Battle Royale mode, there is also a Deathmatch mode where you attempt to get more kills than anyone else in a 10 minute match. Host your own dedicated server, or use peer-to-peer from your own PC.",
