    "About the game": "Pro Strategy Football 2023 brings football to life better than ever! If you're new to PSF, be sure to check the Game Details at the bottom!

Change the names of playoff games and the championship game! New and Improved Stats Improved realism and stats, especially defense! Tackles for Loss, tackles for safety, and more! MVP of the game Key ratings now include pass rush on LBs and blocking on RBs and TEs! Redesigned weather You can now set the start month of your league and each team's chance of snow!

Custom playoffs brackets in career play! Set the locations and models of the goal posts for your league, and change them any time during your career! Three sleeves options, and the AI uses the teams preferences and the weather! Assign individual players' skin colors! More rules for different leagues! Customize your team-specific goal posts!

Greatly improved animation sprites allow much more detail, including individual players' skin tones! Three commentary sound sets included, and you can add your own! New Referee voice over just adds to the pain of drawing penalties! Set individual volumes on referee calls, commentary, music, everything! Choose your own music folder and let random songs play, or select your favorite music! All stats screens are sortable! Critical improvements from last year: Editor is much more robust! Achievements in Season and Career play (every season!) Improved AI and animation! Game Details for users new to PSF PSF started out as a simulation engine, developed for a Master's project and I then worked with Coach Tom Landry on adding more details and accuracy. With great community input, PSF grew to include Career/Franchise options, and every year, positive feedback helps me fill up tasks to improve every aspect of the game, whether it's the quick simulations, watching games live, or enhancing season or career play! The animation doesn't affect the results (it merely reflects the engine's results), so you get the same realistic results whether you sim, watch, or coach a game, but now gives even better stats and results! Rather than calling plays from someone else's canned plays, PSF lets you design your offensive or defensive call each play, similar to the old board games! Both Casual and Advanced modes are great fun! Exhibition, Single Season, and Career modes! Single season supports up to 12 conferences and 131 teams!",
