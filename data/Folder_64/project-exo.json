    "About the game": "Project Exo is a Movement based puzzle, Platforming game. You will be soaring through levels using your rocket launcher and rocket boots to navigate each puzzle. I have gained great inspiration from my favorite games (Portal, TF2, Unreal tournament, Quake, CSGO) and mashed them all together to make something I love and I hope all of you will too. - The tools you will have to help you get through puzzles are Rocket launcher / Rocket boots / Double jump / Power-cell - A Timer that displays your best times per level and an overall time display for all levels combined - 15 Slow motion tutorial levels to help you get an understanding of the mechanics and some additional short videos showing the mechanics in action - 20 Normal levels with increasing difficulty - An unlockable playground level that gives you a behind the scenes look at the development process",
