    "About the game": "Welcome to Race Day Rampage , a Social Arcade Racing game built for streamers and their audience. In the game, you take on the role of Race Director. You pick the tracks, invite your audience and control the race. Cinematic camera controls let you zoom in on specific racers or areas, or zoom out and watch the race from afar. At the same time, the tracks will have various traps that you can control to add to the chaos and influence the race. Each racer is a real person! Your audience can join through their mobile device (with our companion app), or via the chat interface*. The racers get to customize their car, boost with nitro, charge the traps and do other things to be seen. You get to officiate, be the commentator and the camera person, and when the time is right, blow up some cars! Features: - Twitch Integration* to easily connect your audience to the game - Track editor to create amazing custom races - A large variety of ready-made tracks to use out of the box - A large variety of cars that can be customized to your viewer's individual style *This would require a Twitch account. This is optional and not required to play the game.",
