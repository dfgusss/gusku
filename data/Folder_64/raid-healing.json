    "About the game": "What is Raid Healing and what awaits you! Playtime: 10h+ Raid Healing is a healer game in which you take on the role of the main healer for your raid. The game is based on classic MMO healer gameplay. First you select a target to heal, this is done by clicking on a unit or using the mouse-over function. By pressing a keybind or clicking on a button the desired heal is activated. The goal of the game is to heal your raid against increasingly difficult enemy waves and to keep it alive until all enemies are defeated. How the game works Start a game and choose an area where you want to play. Depending on the area the enemy waves will be composed of different unit classes. Units Build your raid from 11 different classes and plan the lineup of your units for the battle. If it is too hard take a priest to support you. If you want to try something new you can add additional units of different classes. Abilities Select the abilities and heals you want to use in combat from the abilities list and drag the abilities to your hot bars. You can freely choose the keybindings for your hot bars. User Interface Use the option to customize the user interface. Receive Equipment Receive equipment by defeating enemy units. The equipment will be displayed to you in battle and automatically added to your inventory. Game Progress Gain experience for your units by defeating enemies and unlock higher area tiers. If you choose the hardcore game mode all your units must survive to unlock the next tier. Equip your Units After the battle equip your units with new or adjust the existing equipment. Equip the Player Change your equipment to unlock bonuses for your heals, change skill ranks or improve your stats. Modify Equipment Enchant, fuse or transfer set bonuses to customize all equipment according to your needs. If you like this then Raid Healing is a game for you!",
