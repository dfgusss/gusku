    "About the game": "Room 301 No.6 utilizes fuzzy borders to simulate the cognitive impairment faced daily by those with Alzheimer's disease. It brings both a maze-escape game design and the characteristics of the disease (a need for strong guidance and support to aid cognition) together as one. Progressing day by day, you must step into the psyche of an Alzheimer's patient. You'll traverse mazes, each day sorting through belongings together with your Daughter to relive key memories. Split Perspective: Navigate through a maze on the left-hand side (with WASD) in order to look around the world around you shown simultaneously on your right, and examine items within it (interact by clicking with the mouse). Take Medicine: Find [Pill Bottles] and use them to counter your cognitive impairment, slightly enlarging your field of view. Build Your Collection: Each day, you'll be tasked with finding four items of key significance in your life. Collect them and relive your memories. Our goal with Room 301 No.6 is to recreate the genuine experience of Alzheimer's patients and to encourage more of us to use our eyes and really take in the world around us. Through our game, we hope to provide players an insight into the world of Alzheimer's and those who must deal with it. Together, reliving the last and most heartfelt of their cherished memories.",
