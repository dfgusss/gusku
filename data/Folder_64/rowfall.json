    "About the game": "Are you ready for a new kind of match 3 game? Are you bored with arranging falling pieces? Do you want to move pieces in all 4 different directions? You want to see and feel graphical impact? Then you are completely right here! In Rowfall, you don't drop individual stones or figures. You have to handle a complete row falling consisting of eight stones. These stones can be up to seven different colors or five special stones that will make it easier for you to sweep the board. However, in order not to keep it too simple, there are certain events at irregular intervals which can destroy tiles, make them whirl around or totally change the controls. The game consists of two phases. In the first phase five rows fall down on the playing field one after the other. You can move the stones within the row to the left and right. Once the row is down, the next row falls and so on. After five rows the second phase begins. In this phase you can move all the stones at the same time up, down, left or right. This way you can close gaps, change the position of the stones and combine them. You can move the entire field ten times. [center] [/center] If at least three stones of the same color are next to each other (it also counts around the corner), they explode in colorful effects. If there is a special stone right next to these exploding stones, it ignites and destroys even more stones, which can lead to breathtaking chain reactions. In endless play, you play until your stones reach the top. The falling speed of the rows increases from one phase to the next. The point attack means that you have to try to reach a given number of points as fast as possible. In the time attack mode you have only a limited amount of time to reach as many points as possible. . When stones explode, a multiplier increases, increasing the points you score (each exploded stone gives one point). This multiplier is reset as soon as an action of yours does not produce a combination of stones and thus an explosion. If you manage to destroy every color a stone can have, a second multiplier increases, which also increases the points you get for each exploded stone. The best: this is reproducable and this multiplier will not reset for the rest of the game. At the end of each game you earn experience points. These you can spend for different upgrades like special stones that are destroying stones around them, the possibility to reduce the speed increase per level or a wildcard stone, which counts as every color at the same time. But you don't simple unlock these features. The stones are also possible to upgrade in two different ways, you can increase the probability that they apear or you can increase the size of their radius of action. In total there are eight different types of upgrades (five special stones and three helpful functions). With Steam Leaderboards support, you can directly see how you compare to the rest of the world. For each mode, there is a local leaderboard in addition to the online one, which only shows your personal high scores. What are you waiting for, show what you can and enjoy Rowfall!",
