    "About the game": "Action game suitable for live game play and streaming, which looks cute but full of unreasonable traps! 「RUKIMIN's Disappointing Adventure!」 'RUKIMIN's Disappointing Adventure!' series is a 2D side-scrolling action game in which you control Shobomi, a cute cat character, and aim for the goal! The second in the series! Join the 'Shobomi Expedition' and explore the phantom ruins full of traps! Unpredictable traps everywhere! A lot of unpredictable traps that will make you shout, 'How is this possible!!?' were prepared. For example, when you try to pick up a coin, you are trapped in iron bars, and when you are stuck, spikes fall on you, or when you pick up a key, you are crushed because you cannot bear the weight of the key. The game is full of traps that you cannot even imagine. We assume that the main target players are live game players and streamers. As a secondary target, we are targeting players who like to play 2D platformers with high difficulty level. We want the game to be delivered and played live, and for the audience to get excited by enjoying the reactions of the distributors. In addition, we hope that the distributors and the audience will cooperate with each other to find solutions by communicating and thinking of ways to avoid the traps together.",
