    "About the game": "'Stay awhile, and face me' Shufflepoker is a revisited poker game with current auto-battlers rules like Teamfight Tactics or Hearthstone Battlegrounds. In a welcoming tavern, face others adventurers who are looking for fame, with diverse skills and behaviors. Be warned : they will not let you win without hardly fight! Draw your cards and place them on your board, then make combinations to defeat your challenger. Discover a new version of Poker: first, choose your special power carefully, it could change everything ! Start the game : draw five cards and select the ones that you want to buy to make your board, then create your combination and face the one of your enemy. Stronger is your combination, the more damages you will inflict at the end of the turn. During the next turn, choose cards which will join your board and complete those which were unused from the last turn. The game is over when one of the players has no point left. Choose your game mode : - in solo mode: challenge one of the tavern’s regular and face up to 8 adversaries with different behaviors to train yourself. - in online mode: face another random player with limited time for each turn (warning : limited number of places)",
