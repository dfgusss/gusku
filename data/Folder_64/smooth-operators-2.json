    "About the game": "Welcome back to Smooth Operators 2! Smooth Operators is a classic Tycoon/Simulator where you build your own customer service company and lead it to financial success! Be the architect of your building, hire employees to fulfill your contracts, develop your business, and keep your employees happy! Watch your company come alive and grow while your building reach the sky. Smooth Operators 2 offers a deeper simulation , where focus is put not only on balancing operational workloads, but all aspects of running a functional outsourced Customer Experience operation. The building mechanic is reimagined to allow the player to create a very dynamic, organic and unique office building. All characters classes - not only Agents - have a clear objective in the game, and the player needs to balance and satisfy more workloads each day, as well as developing the business in a controlled fashion. The game also includes a new Research system that the player can prioritize how the player sees fit. But managing your Customer Experience company won’t be an easy task! Employees will get upset if you don’t consider their well-being. You need to balance your staffing to handle all types of workloads that comes with building a company. Smooth Operators 2 also offers a unique interface - an intelligent NLP/AI driven chat functionality with Jill the receptionist, who serves as your guide through the game. What type of CEO will you be?",
