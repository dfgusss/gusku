    "About the game": "Super Space Shooter 2222: HyperSpace (you know like the year 2222, since the prequel was in 2077.. anyways) Is a fast-paced addicting endless space shooter with an inspiration taken from many modern games. A project I have been passionately working solo for the past 2 years with some help from my friends including sprites for some skins, the bosses and dedicated soundtracks for them 4 endless gamemodes where you can fight for the highest score on the Leaderboards Arcade Mode - the main gamemode. Level up and unlock Modules to be as quick and as cool as possible in crushing all of your enemies and getting the highest score out there Classic Mode - a throwback to the prequel I made when I was 14 years old, much simpler gameplay Hardcore Mode - a more spiced up version of the Arcade; everything hits harder, besides you.. There is also a HackBarrier that prevents you from running too far away from your problems : ) Meteor Madness - You're only left with your lightsaber, good luck surviving the endless Comet Storm Adventure Mode - A rogue-like campaign mode, where you travel through Zones and get strong enough to conquer Bosses and free the Amethyst Galaxy from the imminent doom of The Singularity Sandbox Mode / Spacebox - A (almost) working gamemode creator where you can edit a lot of values to make your own type of experience and share it with other players! A unique progression system; The so called Celestial Energy is not only your XP, but also an asset used with some weapons or skills. After hitting a ceiling of this energy you manifest a Power Core used for Module &amp; Skill unlocks, and can Ascend , gaining a Celestial Star , that can be used for direct Ship stat upgrades 26+ Ship skins and a hell lot of total combinations with other customization options 3 Banger soundtracks from SiriusBeat and climactic OSTs by Lidkas for each Boss you encounter Juicy gameplay with strong screenshake, particles, flashes, and a crispy pixel art mostly done by me, but credits for bosses go to Shy 23+ Achievements to keep your ventures validated",
