    "About the game": "Don't swipe - type! Improve your typing speed with this endless runner game. In the 2010s the world went crazy for mobile endless runner games like Subway Surfers and Temple Run in which you swipe your away around obstacles and try to see how far you can make it before crashing. Timmy Types is a creative twist on the genre in that you type words to navigate your environment. The only interesting typing game I've found on Steam is Typing of The Dead: Overkill . The game is a great arcade experience that you navigate using your keyboard instead of a gun, and I really want to play other similar games. Unfortunately Typing of the Dead isn't really suitable for kids and there aren't really any other comparable games out there. And this is why Timmy Types was created. It is our first experiment in developing a fun family-friendly typing game. We appreciate your support of our game! We're working tirelessly, creating new prototypes and always thinking of ways to breathe life into the typing game genre. Hope you enjoy Timmy Types and please stay tuned because there's more to come!",
