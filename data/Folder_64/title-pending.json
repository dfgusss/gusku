    "About the game": "Title_Pending is a story based exploration and adventure game. Become a playtester and explore the liminal spaces of a work in progress video game to unravel the mystery behind JMC Gaming Enterprises... The following text is an excerpt from an email sent out by JMC Gaming Enterprises NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPERS Hi, my name is Matthew Stanton, and I'm the lead developer at JMC Gaming Enterprises! You're here today to help us playtest our new game, {TITLE-HERE}. While you play, I'll be giving insightful developer commentary about how we created the game, and the challenges me and my team faced. Now of course, this is a playtest, and there's a high chance there will be bugs and glitches (especially with the tech department saying they want to test some device during the playtest). But worry not! As a professional game developer, I'll be here to help you through any issues you may encounter. Wait, this is weird, I'm getting some errors here… I wouldn't worry too much about it, RETCON is a flawless engine after all. I'm sure it's nothing serious. STORY In {TITLE-HERE}, [ADD DESCRIPTION LATER CHRIS] [SOMEONE GET A GIF OF THE DRIVING MINIGAME] GAMEPLAY {TITLE-HERE} features a wide array of movement options. You can walk forwards, backwards, and strafe side to side; a new option available is the run button, allowing players to move faster than they would walking. [NEED TO GET FOOTAGE] If the room you find yourself in is too dark, the flashlight will come in handy, lighting up what you can’t see. [DITTO] [Just send without the footage we have like 2 days before the playtest] The observant gamers will notice many buttons and switches, some even activate other moving parts in this ground-breaking gaming experience. Coupled with real funky beats found in radios throughout the levels, this will be a game to remember. HOW TO JOIN If this game sounds like your cup of tea, sign up to playtest for JMC Gaming Enterprises now! Contact us ASAP at this number: (061) 219-████, or you can reply to this email, and we will arrange a time for you. Thank you! Matt RECOVERED LOG FROM SEPTEMBER 27th The device has gone rogue.",
