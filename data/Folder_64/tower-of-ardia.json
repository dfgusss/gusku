    "About the game": "Long ago lived a witch known as Ardia. With the powers of Azure and Crimson, she could achieve any feat and grant any wish. But in time, Ardia passed away and her power was locked in a tower. However, death did nothing to diminish Ardia's legend, and soon adventurers appeared to claim her power. Many tried to conquer the tower, but none succeeded. Over the years, a town bearing Ardia's name grew around the spire, and a guild emerged to ensure that those challenging the tower were qualified. Now, a woman has appeared in Ardia to take up the challenge, seeking to save her sister. What secrets await the sisters? Can Relia stave off the strange force of the tower long enough to save her sister? Climb the strange and varied Tower of Ardia one floor at a time while staving off its corrupting force. Traditional JRPG gameplay with branching endings awaits!",
