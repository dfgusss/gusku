    "About the game": "TRAFFIC is a fictional story inspired by my own personal experiences, various news articles, statistics, and national incidents that remain unexplained. TRAFFIC is a First-Person Psychological Horror game about a troubled child in a home where he must deal with both internal and external stresses. You will communicate with your parents, do your chores, and stay out of the way. Secure the front gate and lock your doors. You never know who might be out there. TRAFFIC is about a family living in Wyoming as they traverse through the economic recession of 2008. You play as the single child in a family of three, along with your Mother and Father. Experience the gut-wrenching tension and horrifying story of TRAFFIC as you make your way through the days, doing whatever you can to take your mind off of the traumatic events occurring. Piece the story together as you notice tiny details within the dialogue and environments. Huge thanks to Bazookya for creating an entire TV show segment.
