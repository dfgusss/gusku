Ascend the depths, escape collapsing wrecks or hoard treasure in different game modes. Immerse yourself in underwater chaos while listening to the groovy melodies of the depths. Infested Depths You're never alone in the water! Grabbing tentacles, nipping barracuda's, gentle jellyfish &amp; more keep you on your toes whilst debris and mines fall around you. Falling wrecks may offer some recluse and powerups. Evolve To Victory Start by picking your torpedo and gather enough nucleons during each round to later mutate and overcome your foes with lethal abilities. Only the last round counts for the victory, so you're always in the game till the end. Game Modes Want to mix it up? Team up in Hoard mode, fight your way out of a collapsing debris in Wreck or fight through the depths in Ascension. Each game mode offers unique rules and levels to keep it fresh.",
