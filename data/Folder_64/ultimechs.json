    "About the game": "The goal zones light up. The crowd roars. A perfectly engineered mech enters the arena under your control. Welcome to Ultimechs. Ultimechs lets players remotely pilot high-performance mechs that compete in the future of sport, working their way up the field with a teammate as they zoom, block, punch and score their way to victory. Taking everything that makes sports great today and combining it with the inconceivable technology of tomorrow, Ultimechs represents the pinnacle of engineered athletic achievement. Managing the direction and speed of a massive moving target is no small undertaking — and that’s why we’ve equipped our mechs with the latest in state-of-the-art GauntJet technology. Aim your fist, fire and control your punch in mid-air to line it up to find the ball’s sweet spot. Throw a heat-seeking haymaker to knock it out of your opponents’ reach, pass it to your teammate, or bash it into your target to score the winning goal. Going the distance to become an Ultimechs Champion takes more than grease, gas and gears — it takes a cooperative spirit as players communicate, strategize and react with their teammate as they partner up for 2v2 competition. Don’t play well with others? Players that are looking to hog all the glory of a win (or keep the sting of a loss to themselves) can also experience Ultimechs in 1v1 play. Choose from three distinct mech classes with their own style of play: the supersonic Viper that values speed and agility above all else; the explosive Nitro who can detonate their GauntJet in mid-flight; and the powerhouse Titan whose size and strength make them a true force to be reckoned with. Rank up in the Ultimechs UltiPass to unlock new paint schemes and accessories to customize your mechs and make them uniquely your own!",
