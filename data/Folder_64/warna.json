    "About the game": "No mercy, kill them all. Soul's like a third-person action game. To win, you need to beat off all the waves of opponents in the allotted time and fight the boss. Souls drop out of the killed opponents, for which you can acquire skills, weapons, and potions of health and mana, which are saved in the event of the character's death. The player can run and dodge enemy attacks by rolling. Treatment, mana recovery and magic attacks are available from the fast slots. Three slots for weapons that change with the mouse wheel.",
