    "About the game": "Spend a vacation in your favorite pool, watching rubber ducks. This relaxing game will give you rest and tranquility, which you have long needed. A variety of ducks will join you so that you do not feel lonely. A day off, an audiomagnetic plays light jazz, and you lie on a sun lounger and sip your drink. Autumn is approaching. Somewhere in the distance, birds fly. With the advent of the night, nothing stops, soft light envelops you, reflected from the water surface of the pool. Around you flutter fireflies. For some reason, the ducks in the pool form a strange figure, but why worry? If you are a streamer on Twitch, then you can easily and simply enable integration in the main menu or in the settings during the game. To do this, only enter the name of your Twitch channel. After successful integration, all new ducks will have the names of your active viewers who write in the chat.",
