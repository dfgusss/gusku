    "About the game": "What is it? WordWar is a couch multiplayer game from 1 to 4 players. Its particular aspect is that it combines word game goals with chaotic couch game dynamics. In fact, the players have to fight for the letters scattered in the Arena in order to build words and score points What it looks like? In WordWar you will chase the opponents to steal the letters they have and try to carry them on your team's base. A big part of the game is based on throwing the letters around, to your teammate (pass) or to your opponents (hit) - this last part is the funniest one😂 You can write any word with 2 or 3 letters, so be creative!",
