Prepare to take part in the world’s most extreme parking experience in You Suck at Parking™, the only game where your driving skills aren’t as important as your parallel parking skills. Race against the clock to yank your handbrake in over 100 wild levels with ever-increasing difficulty.                Going furiously fast to your designated parking spot will not only ensure you remain extremely cool, calm, and collected; but it’ll unlock cool new customization options to pimp your ride with.                Want to show the world your naught-to-sixty skills? Want to prove you’re really worth that number one spot? Climb the global leaderboards and prove to your friends that you truly do have the power to stop. Maybe not the world, but a car, at least.                Stuck in the rat race and want to see who would come out on top between you and your friends? Give them the hard shoulder in multiplayer, and battle to pull into podium position!                More cars? More biomes with MORE tracks?! More customization options?!
