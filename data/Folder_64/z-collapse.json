    "About the game": "THEY ARE RISING Deep within a body, a new virus is born, and it is ready to change the world for the worst. It annihilates its bearer and transforms it. Not yet alive and yet not quite dead, the senseless body answers to a calling, a thirst for blood and flesh. The dreaded zombies have arrived. They spread, bringing mankind's downfall with them. With rumours and videos on social media, it is no longer possible to remain blind to the problem. Unlike most other zombie culture stories, Z-Collapse emphasizes the early stages of the pandemic. How will world leaders try to limit contagion, avoid panic, manage refugees, combat hordes, or simply avoid their downfall? It is up to you to choose among 154 available countries, and answer those questions. Your country depends upon you to survive. Z-Collapse offers a different rhythm than other strategy games. This is not a game about conquering the world, but a survival game. You will first have to tackle damage control, you will have to learn to take shots and yet stand up. After barricading yourself, and thanks to your planning and advanced technologies, you will be able to regain control of the situation. FEATURES 154 playable countries . Far from all being equals. The most resilient might not be the most obvious ones. Resource management is necessary to the survival of your population, for base-building, and to develop an army. When they become scarce, you might have to start thinking about “borrowing” from your neighbors. Bandits are rising in great numbers. Their ranks are growing strong with population panic. They will storm your facilities and will be a thorn in your thigh. Refugee management from the exiled populations. You will be tasked to build refugee camps to house and protect the healthy. But do not forget they could just be extra mouths to feed. Develop technologies to shape your country. Choose among multiple domains: military, economy, society, and science. Apply political tactics : Diverting attention, mass screening, general mobilization, etc. Mobilize your army to protect your territory, or to loot resources from your neighboring countries Use special units to destabilize neighboring countries: agents to spread panic, or teams to infest new locations Full multiplayer mode until 8 players in cooperation or PVP mode",
