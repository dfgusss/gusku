    "About the game": "In a world abounding with monsters, His Majesty The King tasks you with warding off the threats that surround the land. For this, you are given the role of the proprietor of a fantasy town where you will recruit Heroes, manage your resources and supply your shops with the wares that your Heroes need for their adventures. A Hero's Rest will put your management skills to the test as you fight to grow your town's popularity while tending to your Heroes' needs &amp; His Majesty's demands. Unleash your creativity and build your shops across multiple landscapes, from cosy little Taverns to huge Training Grounds, the choice is yours. Each shop brings a boon to your town, providing you with new ways to gather resources or interact with your Heroes' fates. Supply your shops with the necessary upgrades and decorations to push your town's popularity to new heights. Craft gear across 13 (and soon 16) different categories and thousands of customization options. Level up your crafting stations and provide higher quality gear for your Heroes. Display your crafted gear across your shop's various displays and watch your Heroes wear the equipment they purchased. Heroes have a mind of their own and little regard for their safety. You'll need to make sure to send Heroes on quests that they can conquer or they will find their demise. Send the Heroes on quests to gather resources for you to overcome the dangers that threaten your town. Watch them grow from inexperienced adventurers to powerful Heroes and create a personal attachment to those that stand out. Use the tools provided to you by shops like the Innkeeper &amp; the Apothecary to influence the fate of your Heroes and secure their safety. The Land of Felonia needs you, what are you waiting for!",
