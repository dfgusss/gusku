    "About the game": "It's the day before Halloween, and Spooktoids have only gone and stolen all the candy buckets from around town. They have made off with them into their underground, sometimes over-ground (never wombling free) caverns and intend to hoard them for themselves, ruining Halloween in the process! Not on Evie's watch! Evie chased the Spooktoids down and located the entrance to their lair! Now she must navigate the caverns and collect all the candy buckets so the good folks of the town have candy to dish out on Halloween! This is very much an 80's inspired retro game! You must collect all the items on each screen to open the exit and progress to the next. You must jump gaps, climb ladders, avoid nasties and not touch anything pointy! Should you fall into a trap or hit a Spooktoid, you will lose a life and restart the screen! This is a very difficult little game but not unfair! Learn the baddie paths and practice any level you get stuck on with the handy practice mode, once you have reached that level of course!",
