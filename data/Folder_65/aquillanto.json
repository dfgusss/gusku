Armed with your ink-shooting magic pens you will need to battle choatic and reactive monsters, each with their own behaviours... The Chain Warriors attack if their twisting heads face you The forest ants charge when you are in range The giant spiders counter-attack if you hit them The jungle dragonflies fly in fast and swoop-attack AmBush monsters hide motionless until you're nice and close! Kanatoom's temple spiders crawl along ceilings and drop down on to you! Yikes! The Piranahs have different aggression levels and hunt you down The list goes on... 30+ monsters in total to hunt down and splat! HUNDREDS OF VARIED, UNIQUE AND FUN CHALLENGES... Every level has been hand-crafted to include varied, fun and unique challenges. An assortment of moving platforms - some controllable, others less so! Giant pivot swing-arms to master Crazy controllable carts and rigs to master Challenges can often be approached in different ways.. with varying success!

Five difficulty levels so everyone can enjoy the game from casual gamers to ninja fingered hardcore gamers SUPER FUN AND DYNAMIC BOSS FIGHTS... Three totally different end-of-world boss fights. Each requires a different plan of attack. These boss fights have been carefully crafted to be dynamic - you're going to have to leap around like a hero, delivering blasts from your pens to defeat each of them. Take a good array of magic pens and do battle! MORE FEATURES... Three missions per level for featured and extended gameplay (and serious bragging rights!) Secret passages galore - packed with goodies! An assortment of Power-Ups and other goodies to collect Crumbling crates to master and exploding crates to watch out for! 40 good sized levels - lots of play-time In game trophies and player-stats plus Steam Achievements And a story to tie it all together CRAFT YOUR OWN MAGIC PENS... Build your own magic-ink shooting pens from a variety of pen parts, each with their own unique shooting style. Fine tune them on the test range Over 11 million unique pens can be made... ...so... will you find the Gold Pen? NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER... I created Aquillanto to recapture the feeling I had when I played 2D platformer games in the eighties and nineties. Aquillanto is like a classic 8-bit or 16-bit platform game... on steroids... and in HD! Inspired by my love of the Amiga500 days. I really hope you enjoy it.",
