    "About the game": "ATAMA is a stealth horror game set in an isolated Japanese village. Full of devilish puzzles and sinister creatures, with a gameplay focus on seeing through the eyes of enemies, ATAMA aims to deliver a fresh experience to the genre. You don't believe in family curses, do you? Kaede's family had always told her stories about eccentric Aunt Noriko, but she's a superstitious old woman, living so far outside of the city. She has no phone, no Internet... Kaede only knew her via infrequent letters... until they stopped coming. Distant relatives drift apart all the time, but the last letter was different: Desperate ravings about 'your birthright' and 'the family curse'. What did any of it mean? Kaede decides to hop the next train out to Kisaragi. To Aunt Noriko. To a nightmare she never saw coming. Features - See through the eyes of enemies to discover their routes and avoid their gaze, considering you are unable to fight back - Use your wits to solve puzzles - Uncover the mystery of the cursed village - Includes post-game Hardcore Mode with additional challenges and permadeath. - Includes Developer Commentary - Have trouble with stealth games? With Story mode you can play through and experience the story without stressing about the challenge.",
