    "About the game": "This is a game I made for fun! Don't expect it to be the new top 10 games in the world. This game is full of memes, this may or may not be the most effort I put into anything tbh. made mostly for friends and family. This game starts off in a village where you're really REALLY hungry, you decide that a banana would be the best choice of meal! but sadly, and of course, the whole world is against you and your banana habit, and so your journey starts, you must go through the whole world and fight the bosses and protectors of all bananas to get your hands on one. This game has towns, dungeons, and a world map to explore! Each area has its own set of monsters to fight. If you encounter a monster like in RPG fashion, it's turn-based whoever has the most agility gets to go first, and some monsters can inflict status effects to hinder your ability to do certain things, or you can inflict good status effects on yourself! same for the monsters. when you level up, you can gain Abilities to do certain things, such as 'Strong Attack' which increases the damage for your attack but consumes TP (Toilet Paper) Abilities need TP or MP to use them, TP is a renewable source that you gain from getting attacked, defending and ect, MP is gained only from potions.",
