    "About the game": "Beneath the Mountain is a dwarven city-builder and real-time-strategy game. Mine your way into the mountain, discover gold and silver, construct buildings, recruit an army, build traps, and defeat the vile creatures that lurk in the dark caves of the mountain. Most importantly, find the heart of the mountain before the orcs destroy your kingdom. Beneath the Mountain is a top-down, isometric, 3D game that is meant to be played casually and can be put down and resumed at any time. The focus of the game is on expanding your kingdom (mining), constructing buildings, training an army, and setting traps. All of this plays out in a dark settings over multiple underground floors. Games are meant to be lengthy and challenging as you try to expand your kingdom while defending it from constant threat. Also, make sure you check out our growing Discord community. We post all of our changes and development updates there, and its a great place to discuss strategies. We hope to see you there!",
