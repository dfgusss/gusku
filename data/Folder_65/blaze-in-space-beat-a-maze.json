    "About the game": "Solve a-maze Blaze in Space: Beat a-Maze combines arcade challenges with mazes, adding an electro beat to the mix. Each level is a handcrafted puzzle that you need to solve by finding an optimal route. The spaceship turns only when it’s about to hit a wall, so you need to plan and remember the path you want to take. Blaze through a-maze Once in motion, you need to think fast - with each second, the spaceship gets faster and slows down only when you hit a wall. Keep moving, making split-second choices - every mistake costs time which is crucial ranking-wise! Beat other challengers Be it a local leaderboard for friends or a global one - try your strength in getting the first spot, proving your superior reflexes and sharp thinking. Simple controls and intuitive mechanics make it extremely easy to start the game, but increasing speed ensures a challenge to those wishing to master it.
