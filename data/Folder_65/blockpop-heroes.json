    "About the game": "Blockpop heroes is a minimalist fun runner, based primarily on jumps rather than distance, which parodies pop culture heroes through the appearance of 'blocks' and a simple and wacky story. Quick and easy gameplay, no hassle! Jump and jump again to unlock over 50 characters! Each jump makes a random sound from over 20 possible intonations, each level will have a different composition! Original boss fights!",
