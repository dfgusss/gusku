    "About the game": "(Note: This game is currently an Open Beta release. Additional functionality will be implemented in the future. Also, current functionality may be altered or removed with or without notice.) A PvP indie pixel-art monster battler with a unique approach to turn-based combat. Choose your moves 3 turns ahead... and create a 'Plan B' for if things go wrong! Will you wield your contingency plans to create ambiguous multi-layered strategies, or to fortify a brute-force offense? Choose from a diverse pool of Creatures, each with their own unique attacks and animations, to build a team that suits your preferences. Then go head-to-head against other players online. This game's system is unique in that players must publicly declare their moves up to 3 turns in advance. However, what a player says they're going to do might not match their real intentions -- with 'Contingency Plans,' a player can make secret modifications to their publicly-stated orders that only take effect if certain conditions are met! The key to victory is to thwart the opponent's publicly-declared moves while trying not to inadvertently trigger their Contingency Plans.",
