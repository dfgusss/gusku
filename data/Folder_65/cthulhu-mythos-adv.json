    "About the game": "You find yourself in an odd abandoned hospital, with memories clouded. Strange voices echo through your mind… In this place where unsettling things happen, you must maintain your sanity while uncovering the truth. The only things you can rely on are “Ability” and “Luck”. You also might need some “helping hand”, occasionally… Will you and your friends be able to escape the cycle? Game Features -Randomized Player Stats Your stats are randomized and customized at the start of a game, making each playthrough unique! -Exploration To escape, gather items and information. -Choice A dice roll determines the success or failure of your choices at critical moments. The success rate is determined by the stats of you and your companions. -Insane Behavior When luck is not on your side, you may be affected by the power of madness and behave abnormally. -Multiple Endings The ending will be affected by your choices. There are seven different endings. -The Truth Throughout the main story, keeping your sanity level at a certain level will allow access to hidden information. Available Languages: The game is currently only available in Japanese but we intend to make it available in English and Simplified Chinese in the future.",
