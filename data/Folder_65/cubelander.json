    "About the game": "MORE THAN A TOWER DEFENCE - Cubelander is a fast paced tower-defence game, where you defend the sacred Cubeverse against hostile forces, and discover the singularity that is summoning these geometrical invaders. Immerse yourself inside Symmetria and find the backstory behind every faction. Not everything is as it seems... A VERSATILE ARSENAL - There are multiple distinct methods to play Cubelander! Will you let your towers take the front seat, bolstering your defensive capabilities, and decimating enemies, or build up a resource empire, for powerful energy-consuming towers? Or will you rely on your faithful defenders and support towers to do such a job, and take a hands-on approach? Or will you fire orbital strikes everywhere and obliterate waves of enemies? Cubelander makes a tower defence map ever more interactive, with enemies defenders and towers seamlessly interacting amongst each other! Discover every combination of synergizing towers, and master the distinct playstyles! INTERACTIVE MAPS - Fight inside 4 unique environments! (We're not going to spoil), and overcome the unique challenges of each environment, and use the track to your advantage. Defeat each kind of enemy, which each possess a different, significant threat to the safety of your cores! Play through some levels with just ONE tower to place down, other levels where you cannot generate resources, and more! BRUTAL BOSSFIGHTS - Take on the strongest commanders of the Geometric Invasion - from a cubic nightmare, to the leader of the geometric void himself! Fight heart-stopping bossfights that test your tower defence skills (and quick decision making) with multi-phased bossfights that have a wide range of attacks! EASY OR... INFURIATINGLY DIFFICULT - Adjust the difficulty of the game as you wish. Play on Normal for a laid back experience, (or for the lore) or play on Invictus mode and have to re-learn the game again, with new mechanics such as a rage bar, stronger and more tenacious enemies, and reworked bossfight AIs (Only for the most brave and daring). Test your strategical prowess in elite wormhole stages, and acquire unique towers and defenders to assist you along the way! This game designed is for EVERYONE. Whether you are a tower defence champion or just a casual player, the game has something for YOU. A complete beginner would feel totally comfortable starting at 1-1 on Normal mode, whereas a pro may go for those wormhole stages on Invictus Mode (Insane boss raids on the highest difficulty level) Nothing is unbeatable with thorough planning and strategising.",
