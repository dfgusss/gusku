    "About the game": "Battle your way through waves of robots as you attempt to survive in an unforgiving, grungy arena. Run through the arena as you dash around enemies, slam them into pits with the heavy ammo, short-circuit them with the chain ammo, and unleash your inner pyromaniac as you light the entire arena on fire with the incendiary ammo. Bathe in glory as you put on a good show for the audience, and be rewarded with upgrades. Try to last as long as you can to put your name down in history. Features 3 different guns and 6 different ammo types to spice up combat. 4 unique enemies to battle against. Upgrades at the end of each wave that help keep you alive. 1 arena with a few different layouts. About Development This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only.
