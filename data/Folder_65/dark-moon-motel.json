    "About the game": "Dark Moon Motel is a horror comedy game set in a run-down motel in the middle of nowhere. It's your first night, and your monster of a boss is already breathing down your neck to complete a list of tasks. The odd assortment of guests at the motel are making your nightly duties difficult, almost working you into an early grave. Gather lore, solve puzzles, avoid the wrath of your guests, and perhaps even gain entrance to the motel's basement, where you just might find the answers you are looking for. We hope you enjoy working here. Try not to check out too early. A Terrifying Tale of Tribulation - A new slant on classic survival horror. What's worse than working a dead-end job? Working a job where you might not live long enough to see the end of your shift! Explore the derelict hotel, manage what few survival resources you have to navigate the dark rooms, find the clues you will need to solve puzzles, and avoid monsters in this first-person adventure. Perplexing Puzzles - Perplexing Puzzles - Every puzzle you will encounter in the Dark Moon Motel is different. Perhaps the motel's permanent guests will help you by way of alliterative rhyming? They can be quite punny. Or you may need to explore your surroundings thoroughly to find enough clues to find your way through. Optional Outcomes - There are a few ways your night shift can end. Will you check out early? Or will you find your way to the hidden portal... and a promotion? Menacing Monsters - A unique series of monsters awaits you throughout the night. Some you will find familiar, perhaps even comforting, but others will be far less common. Don't forget to keep an eye out for your boss. He can be quite... demanding.",
