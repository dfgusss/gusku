    "About the game": "Enter the Datascape through two game modes: RUN or EXPLORE. In the RUN, play as Cord, a hacker for hire. With your flatline construct AI Zen, assist the runners outside in stealing from the SimulaCom Corporation. During the downtime explore a section of the Datascape, entering programs that can be similar to personal websites or could house an AI that controls corporate androids. The RUN will put you under pressure. The runners' lives are on the line and situations may get tense! If you just want a chill exploratory experience, this game is still for you. In EXPLORE mode, you are free to take your time exploring programs and hacking ICE. Relax and take in the views, find all the pieces of the message or discover what lies inside the Black ICE. ICE surrounds some programs on the Grid. Use your hacking interface to execute functions to tunnel through. ICEpicks can be strategically placed as the ICE’s defender attempts to destroy them. Use ability functions to manipulate the ICE’s variables and protect the picks. Additional functions can be found within various programs. An hour long RUN // Take the place of the hacker Cord and assist a group to steal a virus from the SimulaCom Corporation. A relaxing EXPLORE Mode // Once the RUN is over or if that’s not your thing. Find the secrets of this section of the Datascape in EXPLORE mode. Discover all of the messages or witness what lies inside the Black ICE. Cyberpunk Aesthetic // Experience a deceptively simple neon aesthetic inspired by the early Cyberpunk works. Over fifteen programs to witness within the Datascape. Cheat Codes // Find cheat codes that can act as checkpoints, disable mission failure or unlock functions already found for the next time you enter the Grid. Input // Played best with keyboard and a controller on stand-by. Hacking // Two distinct hacking interfaces one designed for keyboard (TERMINAL) another designed for controller (CURSOR). Accessible // Rebind your keys and use “cheat codes” to customize your experience. (Initial cheat codes available in text file in your installation folder) A recycled game inextricably made up of our past and, of course, lost futures.
