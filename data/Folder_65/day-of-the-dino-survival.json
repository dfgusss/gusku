    "About the game": "This Is the end for Germany and her Axis allies the USSR are pushing their way into the heart of Germany. In this alternate timeline, German Scientist found a way to make a door way into a different reality. By doing so managed to bring dinosaurs into our world. Being Germany's last hope to push the Red Army out of Reich the scientist unleash the dinosaurs upon the world. Day of the Dino Survival (DOTDS) has a unique feel to it as it’s based in a very dark time in recent human history. DOTDS has two main game modes “Horde” survive 7 minutes from the Dino horde to win. 'Survival' Survive wave after wave of Angry Dino. DOTDS has taken huge inspiration from classic games like Left4dead and DOOM. Being set in the min 40s this opens ups some real interesting locations and also allows the classic weapons form this time period to come back in full force. Gameplay DOTDS is based around fast paced movement and interesting enemy movements, Enemy will spawn at different times and speeds every time players start a match. Each map has hidden weapons players can find to help fight back against the Dino's and hidden secrets what will reward achievements and backstory to the events of the game. Horde Horde mode has a interesting goal of just surviving the time limit. The game mode has maps build for it, Maps are based in different locations and are build in different sizes. Some of the smaller sized maps have more of a Urban feel being based around cities and towns. The larger Maps being based in the front lines, open fields and no man’s land. Survival Survival mode is definitely more of a classic “COD Zombies” game mode by having a simple survive as long as possible goal. Survival has maps build for it. All maps are vary in different sizes with some being slightly bigger than others. DLC will be added for free later down the line being new content “Locations, Weapons and Enemy’s” to the game.
