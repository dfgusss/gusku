    "About the game": "Dead End City is a post-apocalyptic vertical shooter. You drive a heavily armed car (called a Chariot) into the wastelands to rescue your loved ones from Scorpio, a gang that has conquered what is left of humanity. Fuel is always draining away, so be careful to collect as much as you can or your journey will come to abrupt end. Relive the thrill of 90's arcade shooters. Key Features: Topoff Mode - collect enough fuel to overfill your tank and your normal shot powers up. Hitting enemies during Topoff builds your score multiplier. Sub Weapons - Collect ammo to unleash your sub weapon and tear through enemies, spawn pickup items and build your score. Arcade Mode - 5 areas to conquer. Each area includes a road section, a stronghold and a boss. Score Attack Mode - practice playing each territory to hone your skills and your score. Leaderboards - Local offline and Steam Leaderboards for each character type and mode. Unlockables - Each play earns Shop Points that can be used to unlock extras. Plot Civilization has fallen and the few remaining survivors are now the playthings of a gang of post-apocalyptic punks called Scorpio. Your little slice of heaven was raided and your loved ones carried off to Scorpio's main stronghold. With nothing left to lose, you head out onto the open road, armed to the teeth and ready to fight through their territory to bring an end to their reign. Accessibility Options: Key Config - Customize keyboard or gamepad inputs. Bullet Color - Adjust enemy bullet color to your taste.",
