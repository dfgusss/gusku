    "About the game": "Dodge, Hop, Shield, and Deliver the crown that brings order to Void Monvitrese! DodgeKing is a rogue-lite, Mega Man battle-network-inspired, action grid-based survival game. You’ll play as a knight who’ll deliver a crown through a relentless barrage of bullets, missiles, and bombs. Whack your sword against a set of evolving robotic enemies that are attempting to steal the crown. Collect gems, power-ups, and beat records in order to unlock friends and upgrades. If you get hit without safety wings, you'll have to restart the run. No second chances — dodge, jump, shield, and slow down time; try to make it to the castle alive.",
