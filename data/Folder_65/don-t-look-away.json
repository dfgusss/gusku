    "About the game": "DON'T LOOK AWAY is a frightening asymmetrical multiplayer experience! Survive and complete objectives as the Human or terrorize other players as the Entity that can only move when it isn't being watched. Pure survival horror gameplay that pits you against the most formidable and cunning enemy there is: another player. Complete your objective and survive while your opponent tries to hunt you down. You are alone in the pitch black darkness but the enemy can only move if you look away, your eyes and the flashlight are the only weapons you have. Take control of five creepy Mannequins in order to terrorize and eventually kill your opponent. Become invisible, play sounds and create ambushes! Use a variety of abilities and your twisted imagination to toy with your prey. Your only weakness is that you cannot move when your opponent is looking at you.",
