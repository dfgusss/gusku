    "About the game": "Overview Behold, the first chapter in an ambitious saga of high-stakes war drama between Kingdoms of natural elements. Inspired by the likes of Final Fantasy, Might and Magic and Super Robot Wars, this SRPG aims to reignite the joy of old-school tactical games with an original, intriguing story. Play as the royal Prince and Princess of a Kingdom to cease meaningless conflicts, subdue the Void itself and bring peace to the land of Gaia. Story Planet Gaia, a heavenly utopia that shines in the corner of the galaxy, fully populated by humanity. They gradually discover a mysterious crystal monolith from a deep underground ruin. Certain mysterious interventions forcefully isolated one part of the planet from the outside with a energy barrier. The engulfed land divides itself into four regions tuning to different wavelengths of the monolith, which over millennia develop into four Kingdoms with unique physiology and culture. Political drama and ominous conspiracies arise when the Royal Children get promote to Guardians of the Crystal in the new age…. Main Features Honed Tactical RPG Gameplay: Defeat enemies using single-targeted and varied MAP (AoE) Attacks. Different objectives, Fog of War, Statuses, Elemental terrain tiles….all contribute to deliver a satisfying classic experience. Enjoy tight and pure tactical battles with no level scaling. Elemental Dynamics: The Four Kingdoms' Elements naturally counter each other, taking an integral part in both story and gameplay. Each Kingdom offers its own spells and an additional finisher after advancing the Heroes' class. Class System: 3 starter classes for each Hero: Squire, Archer and Mage. Choose 1 out of 2 branching classes for each starter class later in the story, for a total of 9 different classes. Mix-and-match with Elemental choices for even more exciting combinations. Summoning Mechanic: Every Kingdom has 3 unique Minions which can be summoned into the battlefield and controlled individually. Manage Soul Crystals (SC) accordingly to call multiple 1st Class Minions at the same time, or spend them all to command the strongest 3rd Class Minion for devastating wide-range attacks. Even with one hero against an overwhelming enemy force, the tide of battle can be turned entirely over with just collecting SCs and summoning Minions. Alternate Storylines: Each pair of Royal siblings picked at the start of the game has unique personalities and relationship. Play the game several times to discover the most dynamics and interactions between characters. Flashy Animations: Witness tightly hand-crafted sprite animation inspired by classic games in motion. Various colorful elemental spells are waiting for you to explore!!!",
