Key features: - A great overarching story as well as individual adventures in each level You play as John, an art thief, or in his words agent. You're assisted by Bob, your long time friend, cyber nerd and the brains of the operation. You have been coerced by Baron von Schickel, a mysterious art collector, on a time travelling mission to retrieve artifacts lost in time. - The combat system This consists of 2 different modes. Plane combat: Combat with enemies in the 2D plane (in your path), which can be anything from shooting an enemy with a bow to smashing your enemy with a melee weapon. In-depth combat: Combat where you aim FPS-style into the background to shoot enemies shooting back at you or running at you with swords drawn. - 5 long and fun levels constantly bringing fresh challenges and environments. Each level consists of a different historic era, in which you must locate and retrieve a specific artifact: Try to pull off a museum heist in the Present Survive the harsh conditions of the Last Ice Age Free the slaves of Ancient Egypt Become a gladiator fighting in the colosseum in the Roman Empire Join the quest of King Arthur to retrieve the holy grail in Albion - A lair to be used as a staging area, displaying your found artifacts, and always giving you the option to continue to the next level or go back to find previously missed artifacts and unsolved mysteries. - Online leaderboard for level completion time and number of deaths. - Great replayability, as there is always more to find, solve and collect to reach new scores. - Puzzles and challenges with many different solutions. - Interaction with the environment. - Hidden interactions, mysteries and dungeons leading you to marvelous treasures. - Find often concealed or guarded artifacts that grant you special abilities. - Gather time coins to unlock special talents. - 3 unique talent trees offering game changing abilities to match your preferred playstyle. Combat: Bring modern tools and weaponry back to the past. For the type of person that prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. Timelines and historical accuracy does not concern you. What could possibly go wrong? Time: You're already time travelling - Why not mess around with time a little more? Time your attacks and movements to the millisecond, and jump back in time to try again if you mess up. Social: Who needs weapons or time manipulation when you have friends... or at least a friend.
