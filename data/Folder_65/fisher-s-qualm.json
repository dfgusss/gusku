With carefully curated sounds and experiences, this game will take you to regions where you can close your eyes, put in headphones, and feel the sounds of fishing. How to play: • Launch the game. • Walk around the island catching items dropped by animals • Go to the buildings looking for the item shop and sell the collected items that you have collected • Purchase some bait with the in-game currency after selling the collected items • Go to a fishing spot and start fishing! What's next? • Relax, fish some more, upgrade your items at the item shop, and collect some more forage on the ground dropped by animals. • Have fun gently pushing NPCs around the map and see the emotions they express • Customize your character by tapping on your character in the game. Then tap on either the hair icon, top icon, bottom icon, shoes icon, or the avatar of your character to change your skin tone / color of your choice. There is a clothing shop where you can purchase more clothing options for your character using in-game currency • If you would like to dye your equipment as different color, click the 'Colors' button on the character screen after tapping on the character in game.",
