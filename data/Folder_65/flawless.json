    "About the game": "Flawless （完美无瑕） is a third-person puzzle adventure game about a nightmare a schoolboy dreamed about. In addition to controlling the movement of the boy through W A S D and using the left mouse button to communicate with the protagonist's parents to advance the plot development, players also need to use W A S D E to decrypt the variant gameplay of Tetris. This game has a total of one teaching level, three puzzle-solving levels, and one plot level, which correspond to the process of encountering, getting along, resisting, and reconciling between the boy and his parents. I hope that players can learn why a lot of children in the process of growing up want to ask their parents the phrase 'Do I need to be perfect to be worthy of your love' during playing the game. The development of this game was entirely done by Thomas Wang, thanks to his parents for their sponsorship of the development process, and to everyone involved in its development. Indie game development is not easy, hope you would leave your comments and feedback below. Let's see if you could help the boy reach his parents' standards and escape the nightmare...",
