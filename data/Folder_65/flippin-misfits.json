    "About the game": "Repeat after us: Normal-gravity combat is for wusses. Get ready to join the Flippin Misfits – a gang of fun-loving young daredevils – to slash, dash, and flip your way to bragging rights in this colorful, chaotic, gravity-swapping melee brawler. Your arena is the Arkade, a stolen starship parked by a trio of black holes known as The Blank. Using odds and ends drifting by, the gang has transformed their clubhouse into the weirdest, deadliest playground in the galaxy. From environments to characters, sci-fi and underground aesthetics collide to create a funky neon-pastel world, with a soundtrack to match. And those footprints on the ceiling? All part of the game. Strap on your Blazarpack and become a gravity-bending gladiator, hunting down opponents across any surface inside or outside the ship. FEATURES Kinetic Multiplayer Action Jump into 2-4 player online matches and rack up the kills against friends and strangers alike. Instant respawns mean you’re always in on the action, and quick matches mean there’s always time for one more round. Gravity Gladiators Control gravity itself and watch it become your greatest weapon. Experience combat mobility like never before as you swap your personal gravity between the floor, ceiling, walls, and back again in the blink of an eye. Chases can go anywhere, attacks can come from everywhere, and controlled chaos is the name of the game. Mod it Up! Every round starts with players choosing from a randomized assortment of combat and movement power-ups. With 35 different mods up for grabs every round, that’s like… (counts on fingers) … a bajillion different ways each match could go. Take a beating? No problem. Lowest score gets first crack at the power ups. Welcome to the Arkade If your opponents don’t kill you, these arenas just might. From graffiti-covered playgrounds to open space exteriors, Arkade’s arenas are built for fun with gravity. Each has a balance of opportunities and hazards including lava pools, flaming thrusters, stray mines, and speakers so loud they’ll knock you off your feet.",
