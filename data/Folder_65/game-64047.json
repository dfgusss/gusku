When the TP value reaches the peak, the rage form can be triggered, not only the attributes of all aspects are improved, but also the 'anger skills' (nirvana skills) can be used. At the same time, the operation during the battle is simplified, the rhythm is accelerated, the operation is convenient, and the procrastination is avoided. The skills have been simplified, but the pertinence has been increased, the skill bar with too many skills has been abandoned, and some skills that are hardly used and have a low sense of presence have also been removed. Team skills can bring positive effects to the team, and special characters can also create props and special equipment for the team. Equipment and Inscription There are dozens of monster nests in the game, and each nest has a unique suit drop. These suits and equipment cannot be bought in the equipment store. For this purpose, the equipment map is specially designed for players to collect. Wearing the correct inscriptions can not only improve your own defense, but also increase your damage to monsters in battle, which is very important in critical battles. Task and assessment meeting Missions are divided into main missions, side missions and alliance missions. The main quest will advance the story of the game, the side quests can get relatively good rewards, and the alliance quests can be repeated. The number of completed alliance tasks will lead to changes in the rewards of the appraisal meeting. Of course, this is also related to the professional class of the alliance, which are complementary. If you become a lazy hero, although there will be no corresponding punishment, you can only get the basic reward of the evaluation meeting. Summary The game is not over yet, and it will take a long time to create follow-up content. If you like this game, please continue to pay attention.
