    "About the game": "'Sorana to Sunny no Atelier' is a somewhat nostalgic JRPG that focuses on item synthesis. Although it is in the RPG genre, there is no grand theme of adventure, battles against powerful demon kings or arch-enemies, or saving the country or the world. There is no grand theme of saving the country or the world. You are a novice alchemist named 'Solana' and spend your days synthesizing items in order to become a full-fledged alchemist. *Attention! This product will be released in Japanese, and English support will be provided in an update. Until an announcement is made that English support is complete, we ask that English-speaking users please be careful when purchasing this product. Game Flow A simple cycle of 'Request,' 'Collect,' and' Synthesize. First, accept 'requests' at the bar. Once the request is made, go to the field and 'gather' materials. Then, you 'mix' the materials at the workshop and deliver the finished product to the client. This cycle is repeated to earn money. The 'Solana' system is not just a matter of making things, but also of mixing and blending. Solana' is a novice alchemist, so she is not able to create many items at first. As the story progresses, she acquires various recipes and learns multiple methods of blending. For example, by changing the combination of ingredients, a new recipe can be created. The value or performance of an item can be changed by changing the amount of ingredients. By making full use of this type of blending, the player will be able to deliver items of higher value or items that meet the customer's needs, build a reputation, and become a full-fledged alchemist.",
