Gates Of Troy™ offers both strategic campaigns and tactical battles. Lead your nation to victory in the ancient world's greatest battles! Capture the romance and adventure that lead over one hundred thousand Greek warriors to the far-flung shore of what is now modern day Turkey, to rescue Helen of Troy. Control vast empires and fight epic battles in 3D. The 6 exciting campaigns include a recreation of the battle of Thermopylae on a 1 to 1 scale. Take the role of King Leonidas and lead 300 Spartans to immortality. Take control of one of the 19 heroes such as Odysseus , Paris , Hector , or even Achilles and his mighty Myrmidons. Use them tactically to boost the morale of your troops on the field and watch them cut a swathe through your enemies! Build great cities and structures like the Trojan Horse and though leadership, diplomacy, espionage, and the might of your army, write a new history for Greece. Do you have what it takes to storm the Gates Of Troy ? Gates Of Troy™ comes with three tutorial scenarios as well as a full e-book and print ready manual. TCP/IP support is included for multi-player games. Gates Of Troy™ also supports the previous Spartan™ scenarios and campaigns, which can be played seamlessly with the Gates Of Troy™ engine.",
