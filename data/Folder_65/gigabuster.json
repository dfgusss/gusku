Along with a grappling hook, free climbing fences, grabbing ceilings, dive kicking, rail grinding, and more! Special abilities that are either tied to button combinations or have their own dedicated buttons. A combo meter to shoot big lasers, dash through enemies, and overall look very cool with. Shop for upgrades and find armor that displays visually, including heroic scarves and very red neckties. Cool weapons like baseball bats, spears, and halberds. Lots of powerups and exploring! A colorful cast of very normal well-adjusted everyday CEO's to argue with. GIGABUSTER will get you in and out of the action as fast as possible. All dialogue and cinematics are skippable, including the intro stage for repeat playthroughs. You start the game with an array of abilities, including airdashing, double jumping, auto-charging, etc. The movement will let you toss yourself around levels as fast as you like.
