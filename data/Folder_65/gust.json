    "About the game": "Deflect powerful monsters to progress through the game using hard to use hard to master mechanics. +Challenging levels with puzzle elements. +THERES NO SAVE. With the expectancy of between 40 minutes and 2 hours of playthrough. Lowered to around 10 minutes if you get good. Use 'GUST' to slow enemies down and move obstacles, extinguish packs of monsters with 'FLAMES' and damage long range targets with 'ICELANCE'. Don't forget that everything is stronger, faster or neverending, so main goal is to run and reach the end as fast as possible. *This is an indie project. If you like pay once play forever type of games with cool mechanics, i'll be doing longer projects in the future! The witch was sentenced to be put on a land ruined by the demons. But she took the matter onto her hands to escape. Fighting was mostly futile but her spells Gust, Scorch and Icicle were helpful. She was not expected to survive it as it was her punishment for euthanizing sick countrymen, taking gods gift in unnatural ways.",
