    "About the game": "UNIVERSE The world is in constant conflict between two sides that are not at all similar to each other. On one side are the kingdoms of books and the land of pencils. On the other hand, there are electric cities of computers and flash drives. Each side is divided into horizontal biomes that have their own nature, population and cities. For books, these are forests, deserts and fields. Electronic ones have landscapes of microcircuits and circuit boards. The book side has a class society where books are high society and pencils are common people. Electronic ones form a kind of futuristic socialism. STORY You are a hard drive - a super-soldier of the electronic world. During a decisive sweeping offensive, the Book Army used stolen technology. Almost all of your troops have been hit by electromagnetic weapons. You have been disconnected and damaged part of the memory.
