    "About the game": "It’s 1987. You are Owen Gubberson: master puppet maker, and creator of “Mortimer’s Handeemen,” a Muppets knock-off on the verge of cancelation. One night, you decide to try using a magic spell to bring your puppet creations to life. But the puppets aren’t what you expected. They’re sadistic and evil, and they have plans for you. You have one night to reverse the spell and escape the Handeemen Sound Stage alive. 'Hello Puppets: Midnight Show' is a stealth-puzzle horror game. Explore large, intricate levels full of secrets and surprises, solve complex puzzles, and stay a step ahead of a murderous puppet that will stop at nothing to hunt you down. FEATURES: LARGE, INTRICATE LEVELS. Three massive, evolving, secret-filled levels invite you to explore in whatever order you want. Each is filled with unique puzzles, bespoke story pieces, and powerful items that will help you survive. Each time you return to a level, things change: puzzles rearrange and move, different wings open and close. DYNAMIC HIDE AND SEEK. Play 'hide and seek' with an advanced AI that hunts you and learns from you. These are not scripted pop-outs or simple gags, this is a sophisticated, adaptive AI that will punish your mistakes and force you to adapt your strategy. Just running away won't always be enough. You'll need items, hiding places and strategic play if you want to survive. THREE UNIQUE BOSS PUPPETS. As soon as you get comfortable with one villainous AI puppet, you remember there are three of them, each with their own unique mechanics, personalities, and levels. Each time you face them, they have a new surprise for you: booby traps, new behaviors, more aggression, better hearing and vision. Staying alive will take everything you have. POWERFUL ITEMS. You can't kill the puppets, but you might be able to give yourself an edge. Block them with Partee String. Distract them with noise makers. Give yourself a speed boost with Riley Cola. Or cheat your way through tough puzzles with the Hacker. COMPLEX LORE. Fully animated cut-scenes tell a rich, terrifying story about a man facing off against his own creations. But there's so much more to discover. Audio tapes, written logs, and hidden puzzles unravel multiple layers within the main story, as well as supplemental stories about each of the main Handeemen.",
