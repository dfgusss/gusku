    "About the game": "“No one knew where the construct came from, one day it just suddenly appeared. A digital entity floating in cyberspace, with big letters on its side reading: ICEwall. The construct seemingly had no purpose and yet it contained a series of programs, ICE, designed to eliminate intruders, as if its sole purpose was to challenge us. The other runners and I were instantly hooked, like kids spending all their money playing arcade machines.” - ROTN, Console Cowboy With ICEwall I have combined the immediate action gameplay of classic shooters, with modern roguelike game design. A game that is easy to play, but with a lot of depth and replayability. Draft power-ups as you play All abilities and powers stack together Build powerful, fun and creative combos Bullet hell action Epic boss fights Multiple player ships with different abilities Multiple game difficulties and game modes Music that slaps! Good luck USER!",
