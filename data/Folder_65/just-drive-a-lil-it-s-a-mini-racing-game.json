The game is hosted by Proxy, a 13 year old girl who dreams of being a big time announcer, just like her Aunt. The Player can play with various toy cars and race them around several unlockable tracks. All of which were created, with care, by Proxy, herself and can be found in Proxy’s Toy Box. The Player can either play using a top down view or in a third-person view.",
