In Kids On Site - Hard Hat Edition, you will be able to take the controls of the excavator, bulldozer, steamroller, and the wrecking ball. Your goal is to complete all of the objectives at each construction site in order to earn your merit badge. Let the colorful and zany cast of characters, Bertha, Dizzy, Nuts and the Coffee Break Gang guide your kids through the real thrills of operating heavy construction equipment. Kids on Site delivers 100% real video with instant interactive response. Your kid’s in charge, at the control of real monster machines in a real construction site and working with real people, not cartoon characters. With Kids On Site, they’ll be digging in the dirt, swinging that wrecking ball. Making new friends and most of all, having fun! (Hard hat not included.)",
