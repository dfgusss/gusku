    "About the game": "The fall of Atlantis has left a small island unsunken. The old inhabitants have long left and a mysterious institute has taken hold in the 1970s and disappeared. A long time has passed and you have shipwrecked on the island during a storm to find yourself lost between the ruins of the Atlanteans and the institute. Follow the stories left behind by the institute scientists to find out what happened and find your way home or enter the sunken lighthouse into the depths of Atlantis. Kredolis is a first-person puzzle adventure game on a beautiful island with puzzles and contraptions that will take you on a mystical journey. Power up the machines and scientific stations abandoned by the institute and solve the mysterious enigmas of the Atlanteans. Explore the beautiful shores of Kredolis, walk through the relaxing woods or enter the deep mines and underwater stations.",
