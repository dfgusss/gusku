    "About the game": "So do you fly the Battleships or the little Fighters? YES Lost Fleet is a teamwork oriented space shooter in which you and up to 5 friends command a starfleet being chased deeper and deeper into the unknown. Your mothership is the center of the fleet, keep it safe and feed it resources as you jump from place to place. Each new area you discover has precious resources that hold the key to turning the tables on your pursuers. Fast Paced Combat Over 20 Playable Ships Work your way up from Drone to Dreadnaught, each tier of ships lets you choose how you want to play: Dodge enemy fire to collect precious resources as a miner, scramble to provide fighter cover for the fleet as a gunship, or hold the line in massive capital ship slugging matches. Swap roles on the fly The ability to instantly swap between the ships in your fleet means learning a new role is approachable, find your favorite ship and let the AI handle the rest. Play how you want Battle across 8 worlds in Campaign mode either Co-op and singleplayer. Skirmish mode allows you to face off against any combination of bots and humans in custom generated maps.",
