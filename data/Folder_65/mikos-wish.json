XX's literacy is very poor. I can get 500 gold copper coins every day every day 'Mikos Wish'.

Also. 000001, although I am only 1x, but I have surpassed the level of most people (including you). This is the proud capital given to me 'Mikos Wish'. It is no exaggeration to say that 'Mikos Wish' is the most magnificent and most ambitious work in MW Arts so far. Even after experiencing 8700 hours of hard fighting, there are many secrets that have not been discovered, the missing weapons and equipment, and spells and skills that have never been used. Although the combat experience in the game is not much different from what we have seen in a series of games before, various carefully designed enemies and BOSS battles in the game have raised the battle to a brand new level. Just like the Legend of Sye Oda a few years ago, 'Mikos Wish' is also a less excellent work that can not promote the development of similar games :) Introduction to the game · True This is a 'beautiful girl battle' game.
