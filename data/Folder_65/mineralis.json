    "About the game": "To win in Mineralis, not only do you have to beat the game, you have to understand it. In this fresh take on the JRPG genre , you’ll discover the powerful shaping force of deep relationships and moral dilemmas . In a land torn by conflict, it is not the bravest or the most capable who will win, but the one who will make the right decisions. DEEP JRPG EXPERIENCE Meet a full set of unique characters , each vividly portrayed and with their own personalities. Their rich psychological representation offers you various ways to interact with them. Engage in meaningful discussions about Mineralis, the journey, and how they view you. Or skip the dialogues entirely. It’s up to you to decide how you would treat them. CHOICES AND CONSEQUENCES What you do – and what you don’t – impacts the living world of Mineralis. Will you trust the foreigner asking for help, not knowing if he is lying to you? Will you risk your companions’ lives crossing a cave overrun by ogres just to take a shortcut? Everything is meaningful , and the outcomes are not linear. TACTICAL COMBAT. EASY TO LEARN, HARD TO MASTER In Mineralis, winning a fight is not a mere elaboration of stats, but rather, it requires precise thinking. Adapt your strategy at every turn, switch between targets or focus your attacks creatively to prevail. The risk of death is real , so spend the time you need to correctly assess the situation. And remember. Sometimes, the best option is to avoid combat! Mineralis is calling for you. Shape your story and immerse yourself in this epic journey. The themes discussed in this game are not suitable for children.",
