    "About the game": "We are two best friends who both love the MMORPGs and Roguelike genres so we created a fusion of the two, incorporating our favorite elements from each. Mythic is an online dungeon crawler inspired by Realm of the Mad God and the classic Zelda games. Discover a world packed with puzzles, enemies, bosses, and treasure. Join forces with fellow heroes to hunt down the gods, or strike out alone and be the first to discover uncharted territory. Become Mythic . There are no pay-to-win microtransactions in Mythic - and there never will be. This is something very important to us. MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER Fully online. Enter a massively multiplayer experience with up to hundreds of people on your screen at any given time. Choose your party. Navigate the world alone, with a few friends, or with anyone you meet along the way. Build your character. Unique skill trees each reflect the power of the elemental biomes of the world. Collect your loot. 70+ unique items, each coming in a variety of item levels and rarities, and able to be further customized through crafting. TRUE EXPLORATION Maze world. The world of Mythic is an infinite maze that extends in all directions and is separated into elemental biomes. Procedural generation. Each room in the world is a new, procedurally generated challenge filled with challenging puzzles and winding mazes. Discovery. Mysteries are scattered throughout Mythic. Will you be the first to uncover secrets hidden deep in the maze? Or explore an area no other player has ever seen? Rewarding Achievements. The first few players to discover uncharted territory will earn rare treasure. High scoring players in minigames will earn equipment only they can wield. Real accomplishments mean real rewards in Mythic. ROGUELIKE ELEMENTS Live. Die. Repeat. Prepare for challenging combat and gameplay that will lead to frequent and punishing deaths. Many Roguelites. Each elemental biome in Mythic is designed as a self-contained roguelite. Death will return you to the start of the biome you are currently exploring. No Permadeath. Complete a biome to unlock new abilities and areas. Completed biomes stay complete, even if you die.",
