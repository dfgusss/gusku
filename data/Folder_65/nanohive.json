    "About the game": "NanoHive is a fast-paced top-down shooter playing out inside of a human body. You are the Operator of a high-tech hive of nanobots with only one goal in mind, eradicating all the pesky bacteria and viruses as fast as possible. Explore and disinfect the different organs. Your tool is also your most important resource. Nanobots act as your health, ammunition and fuel. Manage them carefully. Nanobots are designed to absorb the organic matter present in bacteria so that they can multiply themselves. You need to be as fast as possible when lives are on the line. Being faster than the other Operators on the leaderboard doesn't hurt either.",
