    "About the game": "At the dawn of history, Bronze Age kings built the first empires. Strategize their rise to power in a uniquely streamlined 4X. Expand your borders, build cities in tactical locations then raise armies to defend them. Each turn, you receive opportunities but must choose only one, complete the objective to earn the reward. Random victory conditions make every game different; custom victory conditions support different styles of play. DISTILLED DESIGN Focus on strategy over tactics, we’ve stripped the busywork out of 4X gameplay. Combat abstracted into an innovative Power system, you only move armies and fleets. HISTORICAL MAPS 8 handmade maps charting Bronze Ages around the world. 52 empires to play, traits give each a unique set of challenges. SINGLEPLAYER Learn how to play in a short story campaign about explorer, Gertrude Bell. Climb the difficulty ladder against our data-driven AI, which doesn't cheat to compete. MULTIPLAYER Players take their turns simultaneously so there’s no waiting around. Play well to earn Treasure in ‘live’ (short turn timers) or ‘asynchronous’ (long game timers).
