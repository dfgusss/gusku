    "About the game": "'Party Friends is a mini-game collection. Play games like Fall Tower, Parcour, Live or Die or Prop Hunt. Play against up to 16 players. In future updates Party Friends will of course be expanded with more minigames. The game mode 'Last Friend Standing' will also find its way into the game. Communicate with other players via Chat or Voice. At this stage there are 5 different mini-games These include Prop Hunt, Fall Tower, Parcour, Live or Die and Infected. In the future, classics like Red Light/Green Light or Hide and Seek will be added. We want to ensure replay value, of course. That's why we are trying hard to add several mini-games to Party Friends. We are already working on the well-known Last Man Standing game mode. In which it is a matter of running through several mini-games until there is only one surviving player. Also in future updates there will be character costumes like hats, shirts or pants to make your character unique.",
