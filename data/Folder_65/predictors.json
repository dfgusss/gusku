    "About the game": "Turn-based multiplayer roguelike When the wizards get bored, they begin to arrange battle royales between the brave heroes and the hordes of evil spirits. Choose a hero, manage his plans and predict the moves of opponents. Play against artificial intelligence, as well as with your friends - in cooperative and PvP modes. Procedurally generated Dark Forest Choose the game difficulty, explore the Dark Forest, find powerful artifacts, and improve them using runestones. Destroy enemies on your way, and close Dark Portals to stop their invasion. Find and destroy the Lich Lord to complete the game. And then - adjust the difficulty and start again! Every map is different, also as every playthrough. Simple rules for deep gameplay Each hero has three specialized skills that are responsible for his attacks. Also, all heroes have three 'standard' skills that support different play styles - defensive, aggressive, and mobile. You can develop these skills during getting levels, and artifacts can also enhance them. There is something to think about here! We Go system to outwit your enemies Players and AI move simultaneously, not turn by turn. In multiplayer, it means that you give orders at the same time and then at the same time watch how they are realized. It saves waiting time and opens up room for maneuver. Choose where to move your character, which skills to use, and which way to look and attack. At the same time, try to consider what opponents can do. The game is turn-based, so you don't have to click faster than your opponents. You have to outwit them by being the best predictor!",
