    "About the game": "SUMMARY Psycho Reign is a Single or 2 player co-operative online horror puzzle and stealth game where in each level you will be chased by blood thirsty Psychos. There is no turning back. Once you have started it's you or them. You need to solve mini puzzles in order to progress further on the map. Ultimately, you need to find something to fight back but until then your best chance is to hide and play stealth. GAMEPLAY In Psycho Reign you will roam around a dark, abandoned cemetery. Throughout the level you will be chased by two bloody thirsty psycho killers. These guys are not joking. If they find you, you will rest in pieces. The cemetery is divided into several gardens. Each one of these gardens have at least two exits. Each garden has a hidden key. You need to find the key by solving simple puzzles. Once you have the key, you can decide which direction you will be heading to. In the first garden you will be given 2 keys. This allows you to try different strategies or think way ahead. You can skip a garden by using the second key and just rush through the first one. You can keep the second key for later if you need to quickly leave the area or if you are playing with a friend each one of you can take a key and head to different directions. It's all up to you. Ultimately you need to find a weapon and bring salvation to your chasers. And as if that wasn't enough, prepare to face a creepy entity who was slaughtered here and haunts the area ever since. KEY FEATURES Single or 2 player cooperative Struggle alone or with a friend. Use the environment to hide Hide in crypts, among broken graves or just simply behind a fence. In-game voice chat Just in case if you join to a random lobby.

Scaling difficulty The Psychos will behave differently as the game progresses. Replayability Go to any direction you want. Collectible items will always spawn at different location of the map.
