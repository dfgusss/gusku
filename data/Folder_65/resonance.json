The origins of Resonance Mittweida University of Applied Sciences has been offering the Media Informatics and Interactive Entertainment degree program since 2011 and has since been training creative students in a variety of disciplines. The goals and content of this bachelor's degree program are shaped by the current professional image of modern media informatics in the Web 2.0 environment. The course of studies offers students the opportunity to educate themselves in the field of designing creative content or creating informatic applications as they wish. In the fifth semester, all media informatics students of the class of 2016 developed Resonance in a development team of 40 students over a period of almost 4 months. This final project was presented to the public at beta, the university's in-house games conference. We would like to thank our hardworking team leaders, our great project teams, our helpers, friends, family and everyone else who gave us patience, strength and trust along the way. We are proud of Resonance and hope you have fun playing it.",
