    "About the game": "Introduction: This is an action game full of a refreshing sense of attack. The game is divided into clearance mode and arena mode. At present, the game has 3 levels designed, and the difficulty will increase accordingly (new challenge levels will be introduced for free in the future). Here, you can enjoy the pleasure of passing the customs and play a game in your spare time. You can also lead the heroes you collected to participate in the arena ranking compared with the world's players. The characters in the game, including the villain boss, are familiar to everyone. I hope you can enjoy it. You can compete with players all over the world to see who has the best technology and can stand at the top of the list.",
