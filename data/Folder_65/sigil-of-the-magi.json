    "About the game": "Sigil of the Magi is set in a magical world where kingdoms of various cultures coexist in a fragile peace. Rumors arose that the tomb of a very ancient and powerful Magi, some say the very first Magi himself, has been discovered. Deep in the ruins of the tomb lie mystical sigils that will surely grant great powers to those who can obtain them.. Pick your party of three champions and embark on a journey to obtain the Sigil of the Magi. Every champion has their own unique set of cards and passive abilities. Choose a pre-made faction or mix and match available champions to suit your playstyle. Build your deck by earning cards and relics through battles and other encounters. Craft a finely-honed deck and your party will become a force to be reckoned with. Countless ways to play With unique class-based cards and passive abilities, there are plenty of strategic options you can experiment with on every run. Drafting a deck with synergy is the key to overcoming challenging encounters. Card storage system Ever feel frustrated with RNG? Not anymore - now you can store your cards on a card rack, reserving them for use on a future turn. Mitigate a bad hand by planning ahead. Choose your own path Make your way through 3 dynamic worlds full of encounters, events, and hidden secrets to face challenging bosses at the end of each journey. Choose your path wisely and your party will not only survive, but thrive. Powerful, game-changing relics Relics provide all kinds of effects and benefits during combat and are not tied to any champion - they often affect the entire party and sometimes require certain conditions to be met before their effects can be triggered.",
