    "About the game": "Skala is a game about changing the physical scale of things. You can make yourself large enough to step over a giant cliff, or make a key small enough to be passed through a solid wall. The game explores the consequences of this rescaling mechanic through simple yet difficult puzzles. A level where you have to stretch yourself in order to reach a star. Skala takes place in a graphically simple world with a big house and a star filled sky to explore. The world is covered by a relaxing soundtrack which let's you take in all of the games mechanics. There are over 90 puzzle levels to play through. Every level is unique and has some purpose, whether it's introducing a new idea/mechanic, or developing on the concepts of previous levels.",
