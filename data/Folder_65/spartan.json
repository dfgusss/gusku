    "About the game": "A Time Of Gods And Legends… “Either come back with your shield, or on it.” – A Spartan Mother Over 2000 years ago there was a city called Sparta. The city had only two purposes – to train for war and to fight the wars she trained for. Over time Sparta became renowned for having the strongest, fastest, bravest and most deadly fighters in the known world. They were the Spartiates and were feared by all. With these warriors Sparta carved out an Empire for itself –‘ Lakedaimon ’. However, it was soon to find that its reign was not to be unopposed and other great cities were rising to the fore; Athens, Thebes, Corinth, Macedonia and not to forget the threat from the east – the massive Persian Empire. Spartan is an Empire building turn based strategy game, where the focus is on building an empire through diplomacy, trade, research, and war, but less focus on the battles than you would find in a real-time strategy game. It is designed for people who are interested in the period and those strategy gamers who prefer to have time to think about their decisions. Can you unite Greece in time to defy the Great King and his mighty Persian Empire ? Designed by wargaming world champion Iain McNeil, Spartan is the prequel to Gates of Troy and part of Slitherine's critically acclaimed series of historically-detailed strategy games. Spartan comes with three tutorial scenarios as well as a print-ready manual. TCP/IP support is included for multi-player games. Spartan can also be combined with Gates Of Troy scenarios and campaigns, allowing both sets of scenarios and campaigns to be played seamlessly with the Gates Of Troy engine.",
