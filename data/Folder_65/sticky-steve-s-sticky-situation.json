    "About the game": "Sticky Steve's Sticky Situation is a difficult platformer with the simple goal of getting out of the place you find yourself in. However, you must first master the route and every jump as a single failure will result in starting over, or if you're lucky, just a long way back. Steve's a sticky chap, so use this to aid your climb by sticking to any safe surface, along with his ability to boost mid jump to help reach those far jumps or correct an otherwise poor one. Features: Quick to get into and easy to play, but hard to master. An optional dynamic colour system. Starting black and white, colour returns slowly as you progress through a level. Increasingly complex levels as you unlock higher difficulties. May Cause Rage.",
