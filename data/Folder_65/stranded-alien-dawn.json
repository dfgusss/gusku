The next challenge is never far away, requiring construction of an increasingly robust base using advanced resources and improved defences. STRANDED SURVIVORS Ensure your group’s physical and mental wellbeing by providing weapons, medicine, and much-needed entertainment.

AN UNPREDICTABLE JOURNEY In Stranded: Alien Dawn, every playthrough is unique. Experience a journey driven by random story events, alien wildlife threats and adverse weather. There will be setbacks; devise your own innovative solutions to problems and manage multiple crises at the same time. However, actions have consequences and as you strive to plan ahead, you must make difficult choices to shape the story of your survivors, balancing short and long-term outcomes with risk and reward. MODULAR BASE-BUILDING Design and build your base on an alien world and transform it from simple shelter to high-tech outpost. Protect it with perimeter defences, decorate it with furnishings, introduce automated devices such as defensive turrets, and discover new technology to create your own functioning space pad.",
