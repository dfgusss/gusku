    "About the game": "Welcome to every tabletop enthusiast's pipe dream made manifest. Grab some friends (Maybe even an enemy or two), and jump into your own personal tavern that’s stocked to the rafters with all the miniatures, set pieces, and tools you could ever want to create a tabletop gaming experience like no other! Come together, role dice, slay goblins, meet new friends, and tell stories that live and breathe like you do. Tavern Tales: Tabletop Adventures is a cross-platform online multiplayer tabletop RPG platform that makes it easier than ever before to get started playing tabletop RPGs or elevate your existing games to the next level. (With or without a VR headset!) Build, save, and share 3D maps using an extensive library of scenery pieces, buildings, props, dungeon tiles, and more. Populate your creations with NPCs to meet, creatures to slay, and secret areas to discover. Or, create a player character of your own to enjoy someone else’s world. It’s easy to manage your games from any web browser using the convenient player portal. Level-up characters, edit notes that you can pull up in-game, find games/players, or schedule your next session, even when you’re not in VR. Includes both VR and non VR versions. (VR mode required to host a game and build maps)",
