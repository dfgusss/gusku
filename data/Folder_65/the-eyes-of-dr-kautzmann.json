    "About the game": "Inspired by German expressionist cinema, The Eyes of Dr Kautzmann is an atmospheric and haunting exploration of radicalisation and the apathy of evil. A first-person point-and-click puzzle/horror game, it will challenge your logic and critical thinking skills just as it horrifies you with its disturbing narrative. Uncover the Mystery of a Doomed Town Use your detective skills to piece together the history of a town and find the secrets behind its ultimate fate. Solve Environmental Puzzles Apply your understanding of the mystery to solve environmental puzzles and escape the same tragic fate that befell the town's inhabitants. Experience a Haunting Atmosphere Taking inspiration from German expressionist cinema and gothic 19th century literature, The Eyes of Dr Kautzmann features a surreal art design and atmosphere that will leave you questioning your own reality. Note: Currently, only Act 1 is available to play. The game will be updated in the future when more content is complete.",
