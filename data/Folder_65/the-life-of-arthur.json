    "About the game": "Arthur is a student seeking prohibited knowledge. His friend, Hannah, asks him to retrieve a missing paper that she wrote for a seminar taught by the Rector. The task proves more difficult than expected, with Arthur searching the school for the lost paper and discovering a dark secret about the Rector himself. This is an adventure game. Navigate Arthur around campus, make choices in dialogue, and collect items to solve puzzles. The focus of the gameplay is on advancing the story and learning more about the mystery behind the school. Story-focused: Experience the mystery behind the school, the Rector, and the library's vault. Choose your philosophy: Answer several series of questions about the nature of reality. No combat: Instead, rely on your wits to acquire knowledge through solving light puzzles. Two endings: Decide Arthur's future.",
