    "About the game": "The Odarian Accounts takes place in the realm of Odaria following the life of Cedric Haffenden and the events that follow after his family flees their home and kingdom of Haffenden due to a surprise invasion from an unknown enemy. Cedric is forced to accept and adjust that the world he knew has come to an end. He realises he will have to grow up and learn to fend for himself as he has no home and his family is scattered across the realm. This game will allow the player to take control of Cedric, fight enemies, explore the world of Odaria, solve puzzles and forge friendships with the various characters you will meet along the way. The single-player story will keep you entertained for hours on end with the addition of a variety of side quests when you feel like taking a break from the main story. Picturesque 2D pixel-styled worlds will keep you immersed in the vibrant world of Odaria as you progress through the game. The Odarian Accounts is playable through both controller and keyboard with inbuilt support for controller.",
