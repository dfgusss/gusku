    "About the game": "The Umbridge Estate is a 1-4 Player Co-Op Survival Horror Game like no other. Solve the riddles of the maze, read the notes of the people who came before you but most importantly… survive the horrors within. 'For anyone who comes after me, if you want to survive do exactly as I say. Don’t trust the statues, blink, and you’re dead. When you hear the growls of the bloodsucker don’t make a noise and if you hear a lullaby, run like hell. ' -JP Yourself and up to 3 other friends have arrived at the Umbridge Estate. The goal of the game is to traverse the complex labyrinth while reading the stories left behind from others who have entered the maze. Complete the 4 scattered puzzles to collect the medals which unlock your only escape. The Umbridge Estate aims to be a true psychological horror experience, including features such as player isolation, self-doubt, paranoia and much more. While The Umbridge Estate can be played as a single player experience, for the best experience we recommend playing with friends and utilise the games built in proximity voice chat for the ultimate horror experience!",
