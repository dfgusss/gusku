    "About the game": "Simple yet challenging Enjoy a simple, yet challenging medieval-themed strategy game played on a hexagonal grid. Plop down individual tiles with various buildings, each with their own preferred neighboring tiles, to get the highest score possible. Find the best placement for each tile and make use of special point bonuses for a perfect placement. Hit the next score mark to gain additional tiles before you run out. Your only competitor is yourself - can you beat your previous score? Beautiful and colorful Dozens of adorable custom-made model buildings and items come together into a colorful, picturesque medieval town as you place each of them one by one. Watch tiny peasants walk around between them or take a stroll yourself with a first person camera view. Relaxing and replayable Relaxing soundtrack completes the peaceful atmosphere of the game and makes you appreciate the moment (which you'll want to come back to try and beat your previous score!). Good luck &amp; enjoy! By purchasing Tile Town you'll be supporting a single-person indie developer (One Goose Army). Thank you!",
