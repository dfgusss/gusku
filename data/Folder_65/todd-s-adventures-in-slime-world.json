    "About the game": "Originally released in the early 90s, this sticky platformer from veteran developers Epyx saw players taking on the role of Todd the space explorer, who lands on a planet made entirely from slime and goo, and teeming with disgusting life forms, who searches for precious slime gems. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. This version contains both the original version for the handheld Atari Lynx console and the later Sega Mega Drive port. Gameplay Armed with your trusty water gun, make your way through 6 different gooey adventures, each offering a different challenge: Adventure 1: Easy They say that this part of Slime World is easier than others, but it is still dangerous! Find the exit! Adventure 2: Exploration The ship was destroyed in orbit! A rescue ship has been called, but you have to get to it first! Adventure 3: Action The ship was destroyed in orbit over the worst part of Slime World! You must find the rescue ship! Adventure 4: Suspense Slime World is about to melt! Find mushrooms to delay meltdown by 1 minute! Find the exit! Adventure 5: Logic Your ship has been damaged, and your gun is useless! You have only your wits to save you from certain doom! Adventure 6: Arcade There are no restarts in this adventure, so just get as far as you can! On your way you can find a number of useful tools, from shields and bait to bombs and jetpacks! This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
