    "About the game": "TOMB OF THE DEAD is a brutal arcade shooter with a classic 90s look and feel. Mow down swarms of demonic monsters and survive for as long as you can. Features: Fleshy guttural sounds &amp; evil dark ambient! Pure demon slaying madness! Earn points to buy better flesh weapons from a mystery carcass. Use headphones! Every sound made by weapons and enemies is low frequency brutality! Every enemy produces ultra low guttural pulsating sounds with a rhythm. Pay close attention to the bass heavy patterns and you will survive long enough to see the worm. No camping - demons will punish you hard! Shoot the evil spawn towers to increase the change to get ammo. Floating rib cage heads will pulverize you in seconds if not fighting hard enough. Buy open doors made out of guts and flesh to expand the tight map. One hardcore achievement - make it to wave 10 and get on top of the giant worm that devours everything in its path! Slay massive waves of undead creatures!",
