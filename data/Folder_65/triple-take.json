    "About the game": "When you start any level for the first time, it might seem to be almost too easy to beat, but the levels evolve when you play further. Every time you beat any level, the level changes somehow and you need to play it again. Three times. Triple Take. Ok, you got it. This makes completing levels… difficult. Jumps become more difficult, new threats reveal themselves, and new pathways open up! Difficult. Main features Three variations of each level 5 worlds and over 50+ levels Boss fights! Different worlds are shaded a different color Includes an amazing OST by Tobias Roberts “Triple Take introduces some really surprising game design ideas that left us stunned at first sight”, an anonymous person from Bonus Stage Publishing states, and continues: “Oh, and I need to add that speedrunning this game will be absolutely hilarious to watch.” Discover the real truth of the game. But be careful, it might not be happy to be discovered. Oh, and this is also a horror game. I almost forgot to mention that.",
