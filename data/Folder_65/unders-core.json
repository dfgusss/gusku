    "About the game": "The Reimagined Deckbuilding Experience The Underscore introduces unique mechanics to the genre, adding a new depth to tactical decisions. Plan multiple steps ahead and beat the odds : the game has minimal randomness within cards and character actions. No cards like “ do 1 to 5 damage on a rainy day, no dodges, no random criticals ” Card queue instead of draw pile : cards come in a predictable queue, you know how soon that much needed card will come into play New tactical opportunities : carefully balance your upgrades or minmax all the way Build two decks every run : build Exploration deck to navigate the world and Battle deck to survive the encounters Face the sci-fi alien world You are a backup copy of a veteran pilot's mind, put into a hi-tech powersuit. Complete your task, discover the source of anomaly and find the reason why you were created. Uncover more and more details every run, try to make the cycle stop. Assemble the Exploration Deck Every run you construct not only your battle deck, but also your exploration deck. Remove dangerous events and add synergetic improvements to form your path. Gain more options Every card has three possible actions associated with it. Pick one depending on the circumstances Build perfect combos Break the rules and find outrageous synergies: build an optimal deck where you get triple value out of your every action. Supplement your battle deck with exploration cards that boost your strengths or weaken the deadly enemies. Risk it all to get powerful submodules – a multi-purpose items that can be used once per battle.",
