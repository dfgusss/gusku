    "About the game": "( W )andering ( R )eclaimation ( M )ilitia Mankind has advanced too far in science. We found a forbidden energy source. This energy source promised limitless power. Transportation, home power, military advancement: the power was faster, better, and longer-lasting. It didn't take long until it was everywhere. That's where we went wrong. How did we know it was going to infect everyone? Now struggling to survive, humanity is collected in smaller settlements, with dwindling resources. The use of gunpowder is rare and limiting. We chose to use steam power weapons, stored natural lighting, and chilling liquid nitrogen. But coal is like gold. There's no reason to use the irradiated trees from the surface anymore unless you want to breathe in toxic life-changing radiated toxins. Anthracite, a strong power source that humanity has little left of, is why you are here. You are a reclaimer : one who is tasked to find resources to keep the energy in the city. You will dive into the old world; the towns, the industries, and other settlements. Most have been destroyed. Let's hope your settlement will not meet the same fate.
