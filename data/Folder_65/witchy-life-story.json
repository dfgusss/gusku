    "About the game": "You’re the youngest member of the illustrious, magical von Teasel family, but you’re not exactly their pride and joy. In fact, your grandmother has given you one last chance to prove yourself — or no more witch training for you! And so you arrive in the small village of Flora, along with your crow familiar, Ramsey. You have two weeks to help the locals prepare their harvest festival for success, and prove your worth to — well, everyone. Design your troublesome witch however you see fit, with a ton of customization options. There’s no excuse for not looking your best! Tend your garden to collect plants to use in your magical recipes, as well as other rituals and experiments that are totally, definitely Official Witch Business. Fill orders from your neighbors for small spells like relaxation incense or chitchat potions. After all, if you don’t use magic to solve everyday problems, what’s the point of having a village witch anyway? Craft spells, perform tarot readings, lead guided meditations, and more. Maybe you’ll throw in an extra rune or two for more potency? That definitely won’t backfire! Get to know the charming residents of Flora including three romance-able characters. Will you end up with a date to the festival? Two weeks is plenty of time to plan a village festival and make some questionable life choices along the way! Of course, it’s also plenty of time to cast a village into total chaos… Will you help, or hex? /",
