    "About the game": "Descend into a mansion dungeon that shifts and writhes to deceive and kill you anew with each playthrough. Take hold devious weapons and slumbering artifacts dredged from the shadows. Brave dark corridors and forgotten horrors, thirsty for your blood. The house has you in its hold - descend and survive, seek release. Woe to all who enter... Features Brutal and gritty combat has you destroying body tiles to sap monster health and devastate combat abilities. Blind, maim, and weaken before landing the killing blow. Wield devious weapons to savagely dissect the things that sport and crawl in the dark. Slash, shoot, shred, explode, or light them aflame. Survive any way you can. Equip bizarre artifacts to increase your chance of survival, but beware their power does not turn on you. Strategically disassemble horrific monsters with grim efficiency. Master your enemy’s anatomy, uncover their weaknesses, and use the perfect weapon to bring them down in ruins.",
