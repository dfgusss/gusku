In a desperate situation, the game company turned the tide and opened the door of parallel time and space through the game as a medium. : XGAMER effect. You will need to explore different worlds and stabilize your combat power in the main world through a fixed timeline. With all the elements you find in these worlds, you'll learn more XGAMER secrets with Tsz Ching LEE. 【IN GAME】 'XGAMER - AI Revolution' is a T-RPG plot-oriented single-player game with a super sci-fi theme. The game was developed in Hong Kong, so the traditional Chinese dubbing is Cantonese.

Visit the fixed timeline to unlock the character's skills, improve the character's health, and get more story pieces. Let you uncover the true veil of the parallel world. 【NOTICE】 Traveler, remember one thing: you feel like you are who you are, and you feel like you are real, when in reality you are probably just an NPC in someone else's world. But there is another truth that the person who controls your NPC in another world may also be played as an NPC by people in another world... Explore this endless world, because you will never find the end, and your journey will have no answers... In other words, when you really touch the boundary, you may have found the true meaning of the world. 【CORE GAMEPLAY】 The game adopts a non-confrontational survival game. Although the player can be reborn infinitely, they will only be reborn to the starting point, and most of the stories are under the mountain (the main world), which is safer on the mountain. The main world has no game boundaries at all, which means that you can't touch the invisible wall even if you break your leg. Xenro Device is a selector with the game story, you can select the story you want once you complete the story at least one time. Developer Avatar",
