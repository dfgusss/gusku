    "About the game": "Zleepy is a difficult 2D platformer where you control a super sleepy character that falls asleep every few seconds. Your goal is to get to the bed at the end of each map without dying. You have to keep your character awake, use your abilities and fall asleep in the safest places possible. These annoying, lazy and sleepy characters are called blears. Your goal is to guide 5 different blears with different abilities to their beds. Each blear lives in a different environment with different threats, so you will need to overcome saws, cannons, bombs, icicles, lava and so much more! Look for secret 'blear coins' to buy upgrades at Good Old Jeffery's Shop! Controls: Move (WASD), jump (Space), drain bar (Q), and ability (Left Click/O). The instant re-spawn after death will save lots of time. Zleepy Includes Single-player campaign. Controller support. Multiple endings. Many things to discover and unlock such as characters, shops, and hidden secrets. Oh by the way, if you find any glitchy monitors on your adventure... just ignore them.",
