    "About the game": "There are 10 types of people - those who can understand binary and those who can't. With this game, you will easily become 01 of them! SLIDE AND ADD Move all tiles on a grid - they perform an addition when merged. You need to make a specific number to gain a score. The blank space in the middle and overflow mechanic help you create the numbers you need and prevent you from scoring randomly. Yes, 11111Game is a 2048 variation for nerds. NOT ONLY BINARY Learn addition in different bases, even those less popular. 2+2=4? Sometimes yes. Sometimes no. LEARN AND CHILL Unlock new skins after completing levels. There is no time limit. Just learn and enjoy chill music.",
