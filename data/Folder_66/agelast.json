    "About the game": "Agelast is a single-player first-person horror game set in a South Korean school. You don't know why you're here, you don't even remember how you got here. Escape from school. However, something is happening at school. This school is obviously temporarily closed, but someone is there. Interact with objects and find items to find your way out. There are no puzzles except for pathfinding. This is because I believe that puzzles during horror games can disrupt the flow of the game and cause irritation. This game is conceived up to Chapter 3. Currently, only Chapter 1 has been produced. Control keys are specified in In-Game Pause (ESC). This game does not support controllers. A mouse and keyboard are required to play. Does not support 2560 x 1080 monitors. Caution) It can contain shocking scenes + This game was made by a Korean high school student. Please note this.",
