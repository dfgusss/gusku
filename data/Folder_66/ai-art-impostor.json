    "About the game": "AI: Art Impostor is the brand new party AI drawing game that you can play with 3-8 players online and enjoy cross-platform play between Android, iOS, and PC! You are an innovative artist who commands AI to draw new artwork. You and other artists will collaborate in preparing for the next exhibition, but one of you doesn't know the theme of the next exhibition. You should find a fake artist without being doubted by other artists. Innovative Gameplay Have you ever played a game where you can play with art drawn by AI? AI: Art Impostor will provide you with innovative gameplays. No Need to Have Artistic Taste All you need to do is to give AI some words or a short sentence related to the theme. AI will generate the only art in the world by doing so. You don't need to have artistic taste or artistic background. Sometimes AI-generated art looks weird and strange, but that's one form of art, as well. Play with Other Players You can play this game with strangers around the world or with your friends via password. Your friends don't have a computer? No problem. This game can be played on a smartphone too. Short Game Time It only takes around 5 minutes to play one game, and you can proceed to the next game immediately after a match finishes. Please enjoy authentic gameplay as much as you want. Low System Requirement This game doesn't require a high-spec expensive computer to play. You might be able to play this game on an old computer stored in a closet.",
