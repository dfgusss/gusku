    "About the game": "ALIVE is an escape room indie game, focused on the story of Chris and professor William Johnson. Chris is a young man, in his 20’s. He has no money and no one by his side. He is all alone. He lives in a pretty small apartment. He works in a job he hates, with a very small paycheck. Chris tries out a game he saw in his popup ads in order to cover his debt, so he won’t get kicked out of his apartment. Professor William Johnson is a former psychologist who suffers from trauma. Now he is obsessed with showing the dark side of humanity's sin of greed. William then creates the game named 'ALIVE' and offers a grand prize for the winner.​ Learn about humanity’s sin of greed in an escape room game where you play as Chris, a poor young man who looks for easy ways to get money but ends up in a virtual reality he can’t escape. Help Chris escape the rooms while uncovering the story behind them, and the man who created them. Open Door Games Open Door Games is an indie game studio that focuses on creating games that make you want to play mostly because of the story. We are two childhood friends that each have grown on a different path in his life. As one went to programming and game development, the other went for a cinematic path. Thanks to our long-term friendship over the years we have managed to find a way to dissolve our paths into the project that now we can gladly call, Open Door Games. As we crossed our path together in this project, we truly believe that we are going to deliver a different type of game from the ones we see today, and we wish everyone to experience the cross between the cinema and the game development world.",
