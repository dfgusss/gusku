    "About the game": "The castle of your cow king is under assault by fairy tale creatures and vicious garden gnomes. So dust off that chain mail, pimp out your castle, and bust out your bow and get ready to go medieval in full VR! Can you survive Another Reigny Day? Take up your trusty bow and siege weapons to repel a fairy tale assault in fully immersive VR! Did the enemies smash down your gate with their battering ram? Quick-throw your hip axes to keep them from mounting the stairs! Spend your gold wisely and you can even DUAL WIELD MAGIC STAFFS! Spend your gold on upgrades in between every wave. Arm yourself with chicken arrows to bait your enemies, place defensive sentry towers around your keep, and set up devastating siege defenses! Take some goblin shrapnel to the face? Down a shot of the magic potion to heal your wounds and keep the arrows flying. Nothing is more satisfying than nailing an enemy from a mile away. Show off your archery skills with long-range headshots and dropping speedy enemies from the sky! Defend the castle of a tiny yet royal cow. His pretentious orders and contemptuous moos will aggravate or inspire you to fight on for one more wave. Think we stopped with just orcs? Fight mythical hordes of skeletons, dragons, necromantic garden gnomes, goblin bombers, fire giants, and hulking cyclopses! Watch out for the projectile poop of flying monkeys! Fight off the horde in 360 degree action! Enemies will come on land, the sky, and even from behind the castle walls! Amass wealth with every wave of enemies through Medieval loot and currency! Customize your defenses with upgradeable weapons and stations, like the trusty bow and arrow, throwing axes, cannons, slingshots, boiling oil, and powerful magic staff! Unleash your inner Robin Hood and nail some satisfying skill shots! Compete to be the champion of the leaderboards! Dive in any way you like - Another Reigny Day is compatible with the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift! Cut through over 15 types of enemies, from necromancers and fire-breathing dragons to flying monkeys that throw low poly poo! Bend the knee to an asinine but bovine Cow King!",
