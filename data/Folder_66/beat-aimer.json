    "About the game": "Join our Discord server! BEAT AIMER = BEATS + AIMING BEAT AIMER! is a rhythm shooter where you shoot to the beat. Get your mouse and headset ready, this game will test your aim and sense of rhythm – pull off sick flicks to the beat and track to the bass! In this game, the player is tasked with shooting objects that appear in carefully designed 3D spaces, to the beat of especially produced music. Imagine a rhythm game but with the entire map as the note highway. It will challenge the player’s sense of rhythm, as well as their skill in first-person perspective aiming. They will have to flick: quickly move the crosshair to the target and click, and track: keep the crosshair on a moving target – all in time with the music! At its core, BEAT AIMER! is a game about the joy of mastery. It builds upon two great traditions of rhythm games and first-person shooters, both of which encourage mastery through play. It is our intention to inherit this spirit; this game will reward players for their precision, both rhythmically and mechanically. This is not to say that our community will be exclusive to high-skilled players. After all, we want our game to be fun for everyone! In fact, it is our wish to build a community not only of players of all levels but also of creators. We plan to implement a beat-map editor and music uploader, so that people can share their creations. In this sense, this game belongs not to us, but to the community.",
