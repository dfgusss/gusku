Generate a small, medium, or even huge tract of land Modify the landscape to your heart's content! Place blocks, remove blocks, the possibilities are truly limited to these two Build a network of train tracks, as complex as you like Design your own locomotives and carriages, or use prefabricated models Plant trees and shrubberies Plonk down some plastic people Erect houses, bridges, statues, monuments, mansions, castles, towers, lighthouses, flats &amp; villas, aqueducts, and possibly quite a bit more synonyms for 'buildings' from little blocks of wood and stone And then: lean back, relax, and enjoy the view as your tiny trains meander along your majestic masterpiece. The journey is not over Blocks Tracks Trains is a released product with a complete feature set for building beautiful train set dioramas. But when is a creative tool like this ever really finished? Probably never. This is why over the course of the next weeks there will be a couple of updates, extending the current game and allowing you to create even more amazing worlds. So stay tuned!",
