    "About the game": "Follow Us Follow our official community at： Twitter: Bento Duck Games Discord: Bento Duck Games This is an NES style 2D platform game, the protagonist BlowFly needs to fly and explore to find the pink poo in the map and destroy them, which is the only condition to pass the level. On the way of the adventure, you need to avoid dangerous traps, defeat the alien creature AssMan that invades the earth, destroy the enemy's raw material center, and achieve the final victory! As a member of superheroes, BlowFly has a strong body and unique flying ability. AssMan, the invader of the earth, collected a large amount of [shit] as the raw material for developing destructive weapons. Due to BlowFly's keen sense of [shit], the task of destroying the enemy's raw material center fell on his shoulders.",
