Witches, werewolves, and the undead are amongst those needing to be purged from these blighted lands, however, they are not the only ones. Recent rumours have emerged about a powerful artefact, a book, which embodies corruption and chaos like no other. As one of the Guild's agents, you have been assigned to find out more about this book and to subsequently destroy it. The Guildmaster declares 'no consequence' for this assignment. Do what must be done lest humanity falls into eternal oblivion. - Navigate along dejected paths as you seek clues to completing your assignment. - Combat sinister fiends to become stronger and deliver your dominance unto those who hinder your progress. - Locate and use items to traverse terrain, breach barriers, fight monsters, and unearth treasures.",
