    "About the game": "Camouflet is a short, tense, first-person mining game. During the great war, you, a recaptured miner, are placed in a fighting tunnel under the front lines. All alone with just a shovel, you must recover lost weaponry, reopen passages and place found explosives at your objectives. Upon completion, your conviction will be overturned. This is one of the most heavily guarded sections of the frontline but don't worry, there are always more escapees we can send down. Game duration 1-2 hours Features: Build your labyrinth You must consider how you dig your tunnels. Long straight tunnels are death traps with nowhere to hide. Remembering to construct alcoves or escape tunnels can buy you just enough time to get away or draw your pistol. While you dig to them. They dig to you… Recover lost tools Once an active fighting mine, search for bullets, grenades and camouflet charges. Left behind by the previous workers, check your map for locations with potential weaponry as well as explosives you need to plant at enemy foundations. Some caches may not have been known by your officers... Use sound to your advantage While the chalk of arras is quiet to dig through, bullets bombs and smacking your shovel on wooden beams are not. Soldiers will instinctively try to search for you. Careful placement of camouflets at the right time can take out multiple enemies at once saving precious ammunition. Discover tunnel 397 With military plans, miners' notes and frantic scratching's discover why this particular tunnel was named “À nulle part” - “To nowhere”. Notes can provide helpful information on your task underneath the soil. Enemy forces are not the only danger. Cavins, traps and gas leaking from the walls can make traversal a stressful ordeal. Be aware of your surroundings, watch where you walk and check your vision for blurriness or distorted hearing. Count your ammo The resources you pick up are finite. They are lost on use. You can also select ammo to be lost on death for a greater challenge. The only safe way of storing them is to not pick them up. Do arm yourself now? Or remember their location for the next convict. Camouflet is pronounced Ka-mou-flè",
