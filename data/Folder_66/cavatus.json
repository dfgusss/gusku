    "About the game": "The war against Professor Zor was won, but the price was high. Technologies were destroyed. Only a few ancient flying machines remain. Professor Zor might still be alive and start another war. You must prevent that! You play an experienced pilot who must penetrate a huge, long-forgotten cave system with historical airplanes and airships. Your fuel is limited and your damage points are low. Equipped only with simple weapons, the mission seems almost hopeless. Moreover, the constantly increasing level of difficulty and powerful bosses will challenge your flying and weapon skills. Never touch the cave floor and refuel at airports before you run out of fuel! Look for machine gun, bomb, protection, and range upgrades. Have them installed by your team at the airport. Find fuel and shields in order to complete your mission and reach the next airport. Main features: The game is a sidescroller in a 3D world with physics calculation. When you fly a turn, the plane does not move in spatial depth. Nevertheless, the force of gravity is at work as well as the uplift force of the plane, which only occurs from a certain speed. The planes drift, glide, and crash, too. Depending on whether you accelerate or not. Depending on your speed when you collide with something, you take more or less damage. A hard landing will damage your plane! Unlike in the old arcade games, you have an infinite number of lives. The airports serve as checkpoints and, as soon as you have landed at the specified airport after completing the mission, your game is saved automatically. An arcade game without points? There is not any! Here, too, you get points for kills, for collected items and when you have completed missions quickly. In the course of the game, you will use different flying machines. Biplane: Agile, economical, and lightly armed. Airship: Slow, can fly backwards and can glide. Armed only with bombs and very vulnerable. Can't land at airports. Fighter: Fast, thirsty, well-armed. Bomber: Very heavily armed, thirsty, and very sluggish in flight. Jet: Very fast, thirsty, well- to very well-armed.",
