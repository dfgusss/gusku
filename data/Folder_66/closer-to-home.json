    "About the game": "Players beware, this is a very difficult and self-obscuring game. There is little to no hand-holding or guidance. The majority of the gameplay is dialogue, getting lost, and wandering. It may seem like an incoherent passage in a dark tunnel, but there is an internal logic to all of the mechanisms of the game. I have made a basic guide in the community forum. Find all the pieces of your dad. Befriend a variety of entities. (by talking to them) Figure out where all the children in your town have gone. Talk to people! Investigate the cold breath that seems to come from the cracks under your school. Help out your friends, and set boundaries. (by talking to them) Learn how to use death. (by dying) Enjoy the scenery and vibrant music. Choose when the game is over. Believe the ending you see fit! About the game Closer To Home is a primarily dialogue-focused surreal horror exploration game. As you navigate the world and talk to its inhabitants you will come into possession of items that allow progression through the game. Ability granting items are explained in inventory descriptions. The world occasionally changes, so be observant of audio and visual changes. Check back in on the world's inhabitants from time to time, as they remember you. Please read the content warnings if you are one to heed them. I made this game entirely on my own, without any prior experience, so do not be surprised if you find a bug here or there. Thanks for checking it out. All music and SFX created by Deltoid.",
