    "About the game": "Corruption Ranch is an adult monster breeding and pregnancy game where you can choose different monsters to breed and have a fertility chance for them to get pregnant. You can breed monsters with monsters or with the rancher either with normal pregnancy or with a monster that lays eggs. Newly born monsters pass on the desired characteristics to their children so you can earn silver and upgrade your ranch and buy new monsters. You can also harvest the monsters you already own to earn more silver. Traits are heritable and with no limit to how many of the traits a new monster can have you can carefully breed out traits you don't want and keep traits that you do. Breeding also affects stat modifiers and starting stats of monsters so make sure you're breeding two monsters (or the rancher) whose stats you want to pass on! Along with the standard monsters you can buy at the festival market, you can also find new monsters out in the world. Mate your rancher with monsters that you find to get her pregnant and you'll have a new monster type on the way.",
