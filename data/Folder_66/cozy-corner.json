    "About the game": "Cozy Corner is a calming game that is meant to help you get started with your tasks and bring you into the flow state. It also gives you a cozy place to rest and be productive without any distractions. With no actual gameplay involved, Cozy Corner asks players to work on a task of their own choosing (be it studying, getting some work done, or chores) and sets a timer for said task. As a background, a different range of Lo-Fi music plays while the users work on their tasks. Cozy Corner will have three options for the time management methods: the Pomodoro technique, the 52/17 Rule, and a custom timer of the user's own choice.",
