    "About the game": "Blast through Copistan in a chaotic quest for revenge. With supernatural powers, you play as Kimo, the only one with a chance to defeat Galaxy Brain, and the excessive military might at his command. Use the unique Slingshot ability to go wherever you want, and make Galaxy Brain humble by demolishing his military bases and invading his intricate dungeons. Destructible Environment - Destroy whatever building you want to your strategic advantage, to collect the valuables in them, or just because you feel like it. Unlockable Skills - Unlock a diverse array of skills -- like dashing, slowing time, or creating drones -- in order to stand a chance against overwhelming odds. Vertical Freedom - Use the Slingshot ability to go anywhere you want. It's a magical grappling hook that keeps your inertia going. Extreme Boss Fights - Galaxy Brain spent all of the national budget on indestructible giant robots. It's time to show him that they're not so indestructible. Extreme Police Pursuits - Fight through not 5, not 6, but 10 wanted levels. Expect giant robots and super soldiers. Dozens of Collectible Chihuahua Images - Wait, what?",
