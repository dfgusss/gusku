    "About the game": "El Paso, Nightmare is a first-person horror game about stepping out of your motel room to get a bucket of ice, and instead being greeted by horrors beyond imagination. Become down-on-his-luck IT programmer Luis Rojas as he attempts to escape the dimension-shifting disaster that players will experience in the upcoming El Paso, Elsewhere . Flee iconic horror monsters from film, literature, and myth before turning the tables with an arsenal of powerful weapons. Following in the footsteps of classic lo-fi, high-action shooters, El Paso, Nightmare is your new destination for fighting corrupted suits of armor, damned brides, werewolves, vampires, and more, in an endless, replayable survival showcase. This is the second worst day of Luis Rojas' life. Make sure it doesn't become his first. FEATURES Experience a pulse-pounding, snackable FPS horror campaign. Endlessly replayable survival mode. Original soundtrack featuring exclusive previews from the hip-hop album for the upcoming neo-noir action game El Paso, Elsewhere (due in 2023). Supernatural doors that must be opened using glowing, anatomically-correct human hearts, because subtlety is for cowards.",
