    "About the game": "'I have come to tell you that you are free. Many ages ago, My consciousness left man, that he might develop himself. I return to find this development approaching completion, but hindered by fear and by misunderstanding.' Your final gift to humanity, stolen in it's final moments. An unheard of conspiracy spanning millennia snuffed in it's final act, only to be reborn. It's the 23rd of May, 2023 and you are about to end the world. Story You don't remember. A crashed van at the gates of a manor, a dead driver. A cold chilling fog pushes you towards the entrance where the door is curiously open. Reality ends here. Presented in a late 90's low-poly style inspired by the fifth generation of games consoles, Eschaton is a short, surreal, first person exploration game set in the Scottish Highlands. Explore, analyse the environment, talk to beings who don't quite make sense, experience a short surreal trip that lasts until midnight. Eschaton uses an experimental audio technique, headphones are recommended. Featuring Simple gameplay with a experimental, surreal story A short experience which you can play at your own pace A meticulously recreated world presented in a low-poly aesthetic Atmospheric audio including binaural beats as an experimental game mechanic Surreal conspiracy themed lore that definitely doesn't include any hidden symbology or secrets",
