Combining survival horror with creative puzzle game, Fading Light: Antiworld ensures horror lovers a thrilling adventure that will keep your adrenaline pumping. During WWIII, the explosion of a nuclear power plant has caused massive amounts of nuclear waste leakage into the city. You, an experienced nuclear engineer, wake up only to find yourself trapped in a dark antiworld that circulates between 12 am and 6 am. There seems to be a way of getting out, but be careful, you are NOT alone in here... Blood traits, haunted TV, mysterious voices... Realistic graphics and sounds provide you with a truly immersive experience that will make your blood run cold. Adventure: There you are, finally awake, feeling dizzy. The news of the air raid on October 31 seems to pull you back to the vague moment when the shock wave hit the city after the nuclear power plant explosion. What happened? Where are you? Embark on a chilling horror journey through confusion and fear. Enermy: It's rumored that unknown entities are waiting for you in the dark. When facing with spooky entites, you will realize your weakness. While avoiding their hunting, you will find ways to escape. This will be a battle of wits and courage. Collect: Collecting the antimatters in pairs will generate energy to charge the flashlight until it's time for you to escape the room. Luckily, as a senior nuclear engineer, you have professional tools to help you collect them. Survive: The mysterious and evil voices follow you around. Keeping a weak light source in your hand seems like a good way to prevent it from getting close, yet the light becomes dimmer and dimer as time goes by. How to accumulate enough light energy to store power for the flashlight? You will be facing severe problems in the darkness.",
