    "About the game": "Welcome to the Fury Land entertainment club, where anthropomorphic animal fans come to marvel at the detail of our animatronic dolls! They are programmed to do everything that the natives of this culture love so much. But of course within the framework of a reasonable and legal! However, at night, these dolls behave quite strangely. But can something bad happen because of this ..? You, in the role of an unnamed FBI agent, have been assigned to investigate a series of mysterious murders in this location. The only important clue for you is the surveillance cameras. The building has been disconnected from the power center since the latest incidents and you will have to manually charge the generator. Your energy is almost infinite as long as you keep track of it. Can you survive these five nights? Game features: *Full story mode consisting of 5 nights and introductory dialogue-learning; *Three dolls, each with a unique AI. Someone does not like to be looked at, and someone is more arrogant and will try to break into you for a long time; *4 different game modes: story, survival, nightmare, custom night; * Many different mechanics. You don't just have to close the doors. You will need to lure the dolls with sound or close the screw holes through the video surveillance system. Also, do not forget to charge energy and repair the sound system; * A large number of screamers;",
