    "About the game": "What's FRAIM? FRAIM is a super fun and addicting survival rhythm aim trainer focused mostly on micro-adjustment shots, which are the most important type of shots in a highly competitive first person shooters. Why is it designed that way? The game is played in between two frames. Targets spawn in the back frame and disappear once they get inside the front frame, which creates a sense of hurry. This fact is very important for aim training, as although you try your best to aim as fast as possible in other trainers, you generally won't force yourself to take shots which you don't feel confident in and are crucial for your development. In FRAIM you are forced to challenge yourself for your survival by design . Challenge by design Each track comes in five different difficulties to make sure that you can properly challenge yourself. But what if I'm stuck in between difficulties? You can easily override levels in the game. For instance, if you find that it gets easier to pass 'Hard' levels, but too hard to pass 'Expert' levels, you can choose to play the game as hard but override the targets to be smaller, play it as expert and increase the target size, increase/decrease the frame's surface, and much more. Playing in override mode would not affect your scores, they are simply training wheels to help you get to the next difficulty. Make it feel like your preferred game In the settings menu you can change your game profile. By doing so, you make sure that the FOV and the sensitivity feels exactly like they do in the selected game. Make it yours You can easily design your crosshair through the settings menu",
