A year ago she passed away, and the heir to the house in the village was me. I did not want to go there at all, but at the insistence of relatives, I was forced to pack a backpack and go to his grandmother's homeland. They told me that when I am there, they will call me and tell me what I will need to take to the house, I do not know why they arrange such a mystery and did not say right away what they needed there. They handed me a picture of my grandmother's house and I was hastily escorted out the door and I went on my own adventures, which actually I didn't need.
