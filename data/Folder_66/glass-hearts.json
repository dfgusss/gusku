    "About the game": "Glass Hearts is a choice-driven Boys Love / Yaoi visual novel game that takes place in a psychiatric hospital. In the game you will play as Kai, a young man who has been admitted to The Long River Psychiatric Hospital. Make difficult choices that will affect everyone around you - for better or for worse. Remember that what you do and say matters, and sometimes helping one person means harming another. Genre: Psychological thriller, drama, mystery, romance A severed body found with clear signs of struggle. Police sirens, blood, an ambulance that came too late. No witnesses. No murder weapon on the site. When the police drag you in for questioning and detective Peng throws a pile of folders on the desk in front of you irritably, spilling some of his morning coffee with the abrupt motion, you already knew that they’ve already found what they were looking for - a person to convict. Whatever you say won’t make a difference - but your history of psychiatric treatment does. The court deems you mentally unfit to stand trial, and it’s not long before you find yourself in The Long River Psychiatric Center, a place people like you are sent to when they can’t go anywhere else. To get help...or to be forgotten? Strangely enough, you get a roommate. It’s almost like a dorm, you think to yourself before your gaze drifts towards the end of the corridor where an aggressive patient lands a punch on one of the nurses and gets restrained by two stalwart guards a second later. Almost. Your roommate - Moyu was his name, wasn’t it? - is a very quiet man. Very, very quiet, unnaturally so. He doesn’t speak or look at you much, but apparently, this is to be expected. Everyone around says that his understanding is limited, that he is like a child on the inside. It shouldn’t really surprise you all that much, people are here because they are not okay, but there’s this unnerving spark in his eyes and that quiver to his lips that make you uneasy. Something feels wrong. Features: 3 romanceable characters (Moyu, Lian, Xiuying) 10 unique endings including one mystery ending dozens of choices at every step, all impacting your story 100,000 words beautiful CGs and unique art style",
