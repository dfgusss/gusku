    "About the game": "Gunvein is an intense, dynamic bullet hell STG inspired by the arcade masterpieces of CAVE, Taito and Raizing/8ing. Screen domination is vital - use your lock ons &amp; charged energy blasts to overwhelm enemies before they overwhelm you. Aggressive play is rewarded with resources that can be used to temporarily power up your shot, or to unleash a devastating screen clearing Bomb. Use this to create destructive feedback loops! Score isn't merely a number - the points you accrue come back to you as extra lives &amp; currency for the game's shop system . Features • Arcade Mode See how far you get on a single credit , save your best scores to the game's online leaderboards! • Standard Mode A mode which provides a satisfying level of challenge for those who don’t seek out 1 credit clears or high scores. Balanced checkpoints &amp; a shop system which makes sure that no restart is wasted. No practice modes required, learn by playing! • Roguelike Arrange Mode Test your reflexes &amp; decision making in procedurally generated versions of the game’s 5 stages! Carefully designed to capture the intensity, smooth flow/pacing and encounter variety of hand crafted stages. Classic - has you start with a weak ship that levels up as you kill enemies. Mix &amp; match any of the game's abilities, and upgrade your ship's stats to your liking. Minimal - lets you play through the entire game with one of the 3 main ships and get something closer to the game's arcade mode. • Missions A set of extra challenges &amp; tutorials, from thorough tutorials that will teach you the basics of the genre, to boss rushes &amp; score attack challenges. • Online Leaderboards • Convenient Practice Tools Characters Gunvein has 3 main characters, each one with their own unique playstyle. [Type A | Bagon] Riko uses the overwhelming speed and power of the Bagon ship to dance around shots and rhythmically destroy enemies. Has a cone lock-on which allows you to fire homing lasers, and a very powerful black hole bomb. [Type B | Damul] Damul's strength lies in its vast coverage, safety &amp; efficiency. Enemies can be hit from anywhere on the screen, giving Miko full control over how much danger she is in. Has a full screen lock-on &amp; a huge laser beam. [Type C | Gunex] Piloting a highly experimental ship Gunex, the young prodigy relies on planning ahead &amp; prediction to set up bomb blasts that catch enemies by surprise. Uses charged bombs &amp; a powered up version of Bagon's homing lasers.",
