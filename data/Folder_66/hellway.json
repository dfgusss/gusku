    "About the game": "Hellway combines the advantages of retro stylistic roguelike games. The game draws from such titles as Diablo™ and Bomberman™ but is maintained in a dark-fun atmosphere that may appeal to many gamers. Meet Zazazel, a little devil whose mission is to reach the very bottom of hell. He can do this in two ways: tear through the dungeon killing every monster he encounters, or painlessly place booby trap bombs on unsuspecting monsters (good luck!). We hope that the game will steal the hearts of those who prefer to go through the game with tactics and those who want to touch the sword of each encountered enemy. Game mechanics takes into account - 11 Acts. - A choice of 3 character classes: Pyrodancer , Banemaster , and Rockslider , each with a different skill tree. - Randomly generated game world. - Leveling up and Skill's Tree. - The need to ensure that your weapons do not blunt. - Equipment with life potions, sharpshooters or teleport to the city. - 4 statistics.
