    "About the game": "Guide a group of adorable spuds through a series of challenging and varied levels in this cute adventure that can be played seated, standing or in full room VR. Each spud has a mind of their own, so it’s up to you to manipulate the world around them as they wander, jump and stumble through it. Save the Spuds The spuds are on the run - and they need your help! There’s no questioning their adorable cuteness, but their intelligence is another matter, as they carelessly stumble to their demise unless you place the correct devices in their path. Inspired By Classics Partially inspired by gaming classics such as Lemmings and Pipe Mania, the base premise of Kartoffl is simple: help the spuds get safely from point A to point B. The visual style is playful and full of character, while gameplay interactions are intuitive and snappy. Collect All the Stars If you want the true Kartoffl experience, you’ll need to do more than getting the spuds from A to B. Each level is filled with stars to collect, meaning you’ll have to get creative and reactive in your role as guide and protector. Play How You Want Playable in full room scale VR, standing or seated, Kartoffl offers a fresh style of gameplay where hectic, time-sensitive puzzle mechanics are fused with the unique aordance of VR to put you close-up in the middle of the action. Now Go Save Those Spuds!",
