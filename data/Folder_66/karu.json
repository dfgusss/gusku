    "About the game": "KaRu is a short, horror experience where you play as a Parasite. He wakes up next to a young boy he never met in a place they shouldn't be. Now they have to trust each other and find a way out. The game is about an hour long, and it has four endings! This is meant as an introduction to many more insights to come, taking place within the same universe, so, please do enjoy this little world! A.M. Karu is a point &amp; click, multiple-choice/ending, visual novel game. Navigate around the areas with your cursor and pick the correct choices to reach a better outcome for the protagonist. Find items that will help paint a clearer picture of where you are, and what happened to those who came before you. Avoid unnecessary conflict with the characters. M.A.",
