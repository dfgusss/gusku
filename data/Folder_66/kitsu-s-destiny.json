    "About the game": "Kitsu's Destiny is a roguelite incremental RPG made in RPG Maker. It has a dynasty mechanic in which the more damage you deal to the Dark Lady, the more Gold and Experience your daughter gets to try and beat her again once you lose. You have weapons, armour and stat boosts to purchase, and the longer you take to beat her, the more powerful insignias you get which allow you extra attacks. It may be a grinding simulator, but you can win, it's all about how quick you can do it. Features Made in RPG Maker MZ. Keep dying to the one boss until you win. More damage = more exp and gold. Yes you died, your daughter will take your place. Holy crap 25 years per daughter? it's like golf, lowest time playing wins. But also there's shiny handmedowns. They make you more powerful. Oh, you beat the boss? New Game PLUS!",
