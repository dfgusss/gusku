    "About the game": "Leave a Light is a challenging survival horror game that rejects the idea of scripted jumpscares. All moments of terror occur naturally, and all are deadly. You are never safe. STORY You play as Nathan, a young man whose only chance out of debt is the final will of his estranged father, lost somewhere in his remote manor estate. Trapped in the manor by a storm, Nathan soon discovers that dark secrets lie hidden in the manor's shadows - along with a dark force that pursues him from them. With a single flashlight serving as his only means of survival, Nathan must keep his light sources close. FEATURES Completely organic jumpscares - every surprise is orchestrated collaboratively between the player, the environment, and the thing that lurks within the manor A rich story told through discovered notes, documents, and letters Four modes of increasing challenge and difficulty Each difficulty mode comes with unique lore to discover A secret ending accessible to those who discover all of the manor's secrets Warning: This game game features flashing lights and gameplay is heavily dependent on audio cues.",
