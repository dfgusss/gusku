After altering the future and saving humanity, our hero went on dangerous missions to finish the enemy once and for all. The last mission was a success, but ended with a huge nuclear explosion. The hero became a legend. A legend, but not dead. At the last moment the explosion threw them through the portal. The large overload caused by the nuclear reaction carried our hero to an unknown place and time. 'Where am I? How do I survive? Will I ever go home?'
