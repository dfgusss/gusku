Run LIU_Overlay.exe 4. Run OBS and on any scene, add a new 'Spout2 Capture' source. 5. The LIU controller should appear inside. 6. Have fun! ABOUT THE DEV LIU (Light It Up) is being developed by Australian 09er Peter Phan (pdcsky), a 3D artist turned unreal engine developer with over 8 years of experience. It had initially started off in 2020 as a hobby project, spurred out of pure salt that no such controller visualiser existed at that time and has now grown into a full blown app ready to be given to the FGC!",
