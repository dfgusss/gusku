    "About the game": "THE NO SOCIAL SKILLS DATING SIM In the year 2000, you're newly entering high school. You've never had a social life but are determined to get one. For someone of your inexperience, 'a social life' means 'a girlfriend.' Trouble is, everything out of your mouth is stupid, rude, or corny. It'd take a girl who's just as unpopular not to mind... Will you date WENDY STRICKLAND , the girl in a torn dress who thinks she's a cartoon princess? GRETCHEN KANTOR , the enormous-haired compulsive liar? YANG RIVERS , the roly-poly girl who does whatever she wants and suffers the consequences? TABITHA WOODRIE , the only Black girl in school, who's always hiding behind a book? (Or the fifth, secret option?) FEATURES Choose where to hang out to make the most of (or waste) the semester. Shape the highly responsive narrative with your choices. Build your own high school life. Romance any of five distinctly unpopular girls. Each will require figuring out a different strategy. Relive the year 2000. Instead of the standard romantic presents, you'll have to make do with junk from the grocery store to try charming your crush. Unique responses from each girl for each item. Play as male, female, or nonconforming. Individual runs last an hour or more. Game is built for quick replayability, inspired by Monster Prom, with tons of variant jokes and endings. Original soundtrack and hand-drawn art all by a single developer. You can kiss the dog.",
