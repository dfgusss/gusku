    "About the game": "Explore and survive levels based on the popular creepypasta lore. Each level features different ways to escape with dangers along the way. Explore the seemingly infinite expanse of eerily familiar levels in the backrooms for a taste of the game's creepy maze-like twists and turns. Hyper realistic graphics, user HUD is kept to a minimal level, and solemn ambience will provide an immersive experience. Find your way through 5 unique levels of the backrooms, more levels coming in the future. Every level has different twists, turns, exits, and enemies. 'If you're not careful and no-clip out of reality in the wrong areas, you'll end up in the Backrooms, where it's nothing but the stink of old moist carpet, the madness of mono-yellow, the endless background noise of fluorescent lights at maximum hum-buzz, and approximately six hundred million square miles of randomly segmented empty rooms to be trapped in. God save you if you hear something wandering around nearby, because it sure as hell has heard you.'",
