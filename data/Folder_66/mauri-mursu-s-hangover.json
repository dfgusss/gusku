    "About the game": "Help Mauri Mursu on his adventure on the Walrus Islands and cure his hangover! You play as Mauri the Walrus as you explore the Walrus Islands and talk to its weird but lovable inhabitants for clues and items. Last night, Mauri had been drinking and now he has to find the six bottles he lost, scattered all over the islands! You have to travel through many different terrains, such as the jungle, the arctic, the desert, the fire land and much more. Along your journey, Mauri will pickup new weapons, like the cutter, which he can use to smite down the enemies that lurk around the Islands. Only after completing his journey and finding all the hidden bottles, can Mauri cure his hangover and sleep well! Mauri Mursu's Hangover is a new, 8-bit topdown adventure RPG in 2022! The game gets its inspiration from adventure game classics from the 80s and 90s and mixes in a lot of quirky off-beat humor, exploration and quests. If you are a fan of those games, you will love this one!
