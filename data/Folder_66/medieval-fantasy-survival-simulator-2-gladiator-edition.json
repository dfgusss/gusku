    "About the game": "(This game, as well as many others in our bundle, is FANTASTIC for Youtubers &amp; Streamers to create content, engage with their audience, &amp; allow their audience to better get to know them through answering a series of questions about the content creator! This creates a unique experience for all parties involved, and players playing the game themselves can enjoy the solo experience tremendously all on their own as well!) Medieval Fantasy Survival Simulator You're gonna get yourself killed in there... There's beasts, man-eaters, and much, much worse within the walls of the coliseum... Do you really think you've got what it takes to survive? Or do you think you're cut out for much more than that... You don't think you could actually rise to a place of power, win over the hearts of the crowd, and build yourself into one of the greatest champions to ever fight in the arena, do you? Besides... It's not always the big, scary beasts that you should be afraid of... Beasts are easy to predict. They just want to kill and eat you. Man is a much more dangerous beast... They pretend to be your friend first... Will you be able to provide the answers we seek? Or perhaps... You may find the answers YOU seek along the way... You will be asked a series of questions about a medieval era or gladiatorial themes and must provide honest answers about what you would do if you were in potentially life-threatening situations. Based on your answers, you will be assessed and a result will be provided for you at the end of the game to determine how you would stack up in the dangers of that time period. What is Medieval Fantasy Survival Simulator 2: Gladiator Edition? Well, in essence, it's just what it sounds like! It's our way of reading the feedback players have left for us on previous titles such as The Test Trilogy and others, taking their words into heavy consideration, and creating new experiences that players want and crave! Everyone at some point or another imagines themselves fighting in a coliseum, engaging in gladiatorial combat, and encountering awful survival situations that we always wonder if we're strong enough to endure... Everyone thinks about surviving in an age where mankind no longer belongs... But how many people would actually cut it? How many people would actually survive, how many would die, and how many would thrive? Well, this simulator asks you a series of questions, and through your answers, will let you know your chances of surviving in the realm of gladiators! Would you survive the combat? Would you survive the politics? Would your bloodline continue on? Would you Survive, or would you be just another victim of great beasts of lore, lost to ancient history and forgotten forever? There's only one way to find out... Features: Short and sweet Be a part of history with Player - Developer interaction The only game with this theme of its kind Very atmospheric and psychological Sit back, relax, and answer in-depth questions to reveal survival scenarios Super affordable for a unique experience Multiple choices with multiple endings",
