    "About the game": "About Monster Cube has a simple promise, to put the demon that is boredom at bay. Simple arrow controls Scoring system Addicting No hassle with menus All that is required by you is to 'consume' the incoming projectiles before they hit you 3 times...then it starts all over again. Premise You are a Cronenberg monster meat cube that devours incoming projectiles at an increasingly aggressive pace. With a simple control scheme using the basic arrow keys on a standard keyboard to devour the incoming projectiles in 4 directions. Inspired by the heavy hours tapping away on my own desktop icons while talking or thinking. To start this game its a simple load and straight into the game with no menus just you with a Score and High Score counter. Compare your high score with friends or brag about each time you achieved a funny number. The Future Designed to be a simple experience while you talk with your friends in the background or simply want to reach a new high score future bug fixed and quality of life improvement are the primary goal.",
