    "About the game": "Near Sol is a space strategy game developed by an indie developer. The game takes place in the solar system and in the nearest 30 stars. Lead a space power, small or large. Find the resources you need, or create an economic alliance with your neighbors, organize the production of the most demanded goods. Earn money. Become a rich and developed state! Develop powerful spaceships, build cities on distant planets, or become a large sparsely populated nation. In the cities you will find different types of citizens, resources, and opportunities for construction. The game is published for joint development with the players! What kind of resources and types of citizens would you like? (now this question is actual for the developer). The demo version is exactly the same as the paid version! Buy the game if you want to support the developer. ('Economica' owners will be able to activate the game for free until February 2023 - in theory)",
