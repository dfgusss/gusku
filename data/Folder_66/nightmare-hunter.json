    "About the game": "Evil forces have set their sights on the dream world, and by silently eroding people's dreams, forcing the good wishes of mankind to evil desires, destroying the real world. At the same time, a hero stood up. In this game, the player would act as a nightmare hunter who fights against demons, purifies nightmares, and secures world peace. However, while human dreams are interconnected, they are different from each other. Hence, every battle would be a brand new challenge for the nightmare hunter… Refreshing Hardcore Shooting Experience In Nightmare Hunter, you have to abandon the sight assistant system in traditional shooting games, aim and shoot through hand feeling, ballistics, and muscle memory, which recreates a more realistic shooting experience for you while maintaining the entertaining aspect. Affluent Choices of Weapons and Equipment There are six completely different weapon categories in Nightmare Hunter, including shotguns and howitzers. Each weapon can be upgraded to increase its power. You can choose the most convenient weapon according to your own preferences and create a fighting style that suits you. Seamlessly Connected Large World Map Levels The game levels are uniformly placed in a large world map. In this case, you can move to the next level by jumping, teleporting, etc., allowing seamless switch of battle scenes, reducing loading time during the game, and bringing a state of flow to your gaming experience. Unique Growth System After killing each Incubus, you can obtain the remains of it - the “spirit”. Using the “spirit” in the initial scene would improve your various attributes and make you stronger. Death would never be an end.",
