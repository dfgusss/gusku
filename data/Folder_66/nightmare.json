    "About the game": "Nightmare is a single player survival-horror game where you find yourself in a nightmare. To leave it you will need to explore the enviroment, fight ghosts, collect and create items necessary to survive and reach the main goal - sanity growth. Addictive gameplay Your main goal is awakening. Search for items that can be combined into the light sources to increase your sanity, but don't relax, by carefully examining the enviroment you will also find items that can help you to protect yourself, because there is someone near you who wants you to stay in this nightmare forever. Each game lasts about 30 minutes of real time. Atmosphere Realistic graphics and high-quality 3D sounds will keep you in stress all the time and allow you to dive into the action as much as possible. Increasing difficulty As you progress through the game, the unpredictable AI will change tactics: becoming more aggressive, summoning helpers. By other words, leaving this nightmare will not be easy. Replayability Each next game will be different from the previous one: all the items you found may no longer be in their usual place next time. You may no longer face the enemy you have already faced, but face a new one. During the gameplay, you can also encounter random activities, whether to participate in them or not is up to you, because they can either bring you closer to the final goal or push you back from it. Player progress Depending on your actions and activity in the game, you will earn experience and Light Tokens that can be spent on perks. Who knows, perhaps they will influence the outcome of your nightmare. Game modes Nightmare is a rather difficult game. If you don't think so, try the 'Expert Mode', which reworks the core mechanic and logic, making reaching the main goal a real challenge of reflexes, speed and nerves.",
