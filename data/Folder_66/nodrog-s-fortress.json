    "About the game": "Thank you for checking out my first game! _What To Expect_ Nodrog's Fortress is a Tactics-like Turn-Based/Real-Time Strategy Battler that features elements of Chess and American Football in a Pixel Art JRPG inspired package. Choose your Archmage, companions to fight for them, and try your hand in local Quickmatch Mode or engage in PVP Online with your friends. Either way, get ready to battle with up to 4 Player/AI Teams in Versus/Team Versus and Survival Modes. Check out the Guide page in game as well as our Tutorial mini-mode for a few tips. _Looking To The Future_ This game will receive a more expansive Tutorial as well as regular and free updates adding new Characters, Abilities, Maps, and a Single Player Tournament-Style Story Mode. If things go well, our stretch goals include releasing the map editor and the ability to share maps with friends in some fashion as well as host P2P Matches outside our server system. _Developer Note_ I hope you enjoy my game and help me make it better with your feedback! With your help, we can build an even more epic Fortress in the times to come! Welcome to the Battle!",
