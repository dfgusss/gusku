Use the gold you collected to unlock new abilities like your Shield which protects you from obstacles or attacks. Unlock and use Dash to reach further distances or recollect the speed you lost.

Start off as Redmane the barbarian, as you pillage and collect more gold unlock different raiders such as deformed version of Redmane as Big Head, ate too much Chunky, not so sneaky Sus Knight or coming from the oriental middle east with it’s pocket knife Coffee Hunter and much more.
