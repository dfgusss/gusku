    "About the game": "Welcome to your new home! Nova Lands: Emilia's Mission is a prologue chapter of a survivor you'll meet in the main game. Learn your way around Nova planet at a steady pace and discover the basics of resource gathering, automation, and survival. Build an awesome base In order to survive, you'll need to advance your technology, build processors, and automate your base. Thankfully, you've got a whole array of amazing helper bots that will speed the process and allow you to do something even more fun. Explore the islands With enough technology at your disposal, unlock new islands and gather new resources, meet new creatures, and connect the islands together for even more efficient production. Meet new friends! You are a guest to Nova, and it's up to you if you want to remind a kind visitor, or become an interloper. Creatures drop rare materials, but at the same time, if you like wildlife, you can skip combat entirely.",
