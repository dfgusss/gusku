    "About the game": "Park Ranger: Lost In The Woods , is a first-person exploration playing as a park ranger. Your job is to find out what happened to the missing workers in the area. You have been tasked to locate any and all clues, and collect them. There have been reports of something creating weird noises in that area, so it's important to bring your bear-spray. - Collect Pages and bring them back to the office. - Explore the map (more to come) and find any traces of the missing hikers. - Your flashlight has a battery life, it's best to be conservative. - The forest map is large, and there is a lot to explore, but be careful about having your back turned for too long. - Sprinting comes at a cost, your character will lose stamina over time. If you become exhausted at a bad time, you're done for. More maps and content coming soon. Right now there is a Forest Map to explore. Please note: this is an indie game, produced by someone new to game development, as a first try. There may be bugs, or other issues with the game. I have tried to price appropriately.",
