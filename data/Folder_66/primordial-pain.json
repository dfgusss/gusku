    "About the game": "Primordial Pain is a brutally unforgiving, fast paced arena shooter with one key mechanic: Pain serves both as your health and as a multiplier for your damage output. While playing you're constantly performing an elegant dance on the fine line of maximum power and certain death. To defeat the primordial horrors that lurk in the darkness and overcome the pain you must perfect the dance. Primordial Pain constrains you to a seemingly small arena, provides you with various different movement options and proceeds to through waves of enemies at you each requiring a different strategy to defeat. You will have to experiment with every single mechanic at your disposal to discover optimal strategies or you will get overwhelmed by hordes of adversaries. Survive long enough and great ancient beasts will reveal themselves. While playing you can either focus on surviving for as long as possible or to top your own highscore. Whereas time constantly ticks up, your score depends on how quickly you can dispatch enemies as well as your method. Playing in a stylish way will reward you with more points to be added to your score.",
