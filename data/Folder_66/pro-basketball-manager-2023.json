    "About the game": "Basketball is more than coaching, if you want your favorite team to succeed you will also have to oversee the recruitment of new players and manage your arena to secure new sources of funding for your team. PBM23 lets you be the coach as well as the General Manager of any professional team around the world. You can choose from 82 domestic leagues, including 10 women’s leagues, from 60 different countries across Europe, America, Asia and Oceania. With more than 2000 teams and 50 000 players it is not hard to see why PBM23 is truly a global basketball management game. Overall, including national and continental cups, you’ll have access to more than 160 playable competitions . Once your reputation as a coach is established you might be offered a job as a head coach of a national team. International basketball is now more competitive than ever.

LICENSES The following leagues are officially licensed in PBM2023 with official names and photos of their players and teams : COACHING Coaching is not just asking a player to setup a specific play at a specific time. A successful coach has a set of unique plays that can decide the fate of a game when it matters the most, when the game is on the line! In PBM23 you can create your own plays and call them during the games to take your opponent off-guard. Don’t call the same plays too often though, as your opponent will adapt and try to outsmart you. STATISTICS Be it individual players or teams, you have a whole range of statistics at your fingertips which allow you to manage your progress. You can thus check on your players’ performances (past and present), evaluate your own career, or even look back through the archives of the games of any team featured in PBM23. SCOUTING, TRAINING, FINANCES Through our in-depth scouting system, you can send your scouts around the world to be on the lookout for the next best players to make it to the top. Train your players collectively, but also individually to get the best results. Improve your club's finances by improving your arena to generate extra revenue. GAME SIMULATION 3D mode : Follow the on-court action, making tactical changes on the fly and assigning your own plays to a player. 2D mode : If you prefer, you can also follow the game in 2D. Text mode : You can also follow the game through a series of text messages that will detail the action on the court. If you cannot wait any longer for the result, you can skip a quarter or even the entire game for an immediate result. FEATURES In Pro Basketball Manager 2023 we have implemented a new user interface . All the information will now be only a few clicks away! The new player page will make it easier to access key information. We also have the new customisable 3D arenas, coming in two different sizes and looks. They now look better than ever with enhanced lighting effects! This year you will have the added benefit of the home crowd reacting to the game’s events. Be it a dunk or a dagger from downtown, the crowd will let you know their appreciation!
