    "About the game": "The great land of Daivos was a peaceful homeland for all living creatures; Human, Elf and Orc. Although they were not highly developed civilizations, they all lived peaceful lives where there was no hatred nor conflict between the races. One day, a terrible earthquake occurred and a steep mountain soared from a volcanic eruption, separating the land in four directions and blocking the paths between them. The plants and animals of Davios all disappeared, and this once rich land became desolate, covered with fire and ash. The unprecedented disaster led to conflict, invasions and looting across the tribes, and a war began to breed from this land of suffering and destitution. Purple War is a classic RTS game focusing on online multiplayer match up to 4v4 players in various maps, as well as an exciting single player campaign mode. Gather resources to build your base and train troops, and command your troops to carry out various tactics like scouting, sneak attacks, disturb enemy mining resources, and attacking the forward bases with allied players. Gameplay is intuitive and fast-paced but easy to learn, allowing players to concentrate on strategizing during intense battles. Lead your allies to the victory!",
