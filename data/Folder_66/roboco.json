You have the option to use the powerful and easy-to-learn Python language to automate your creations and let your robots conquer the challenges while you kick back and relax! Using Steam’s built-in community workshop features, you can share your masterpieces with other robotics geniuses, or download others’ robots for inspiration and remixing!
