    "About the game": "After moving to the big city, You receive a great deal on the perfect apartment. The deal would be suspicious had it not come with a single caveat, you can't move the old photo which hangs on the wall in your bedroom. The owner of the building, Vanessa Smith says the room once belonged to her late grandmother who lived in the apartment. In remembrance she'd like you to keep the painting up. However you get the feeling that's she's leaving something else out as you begin to experience weird phenomenon and your dreams become strange and repetitive. Can you figure out what is actually happening? Or will your fate be sealed? Roost is a Low Poly First Person Exploration Game where you attempt to unravel the mystery of your new apartment. Roost mixes design philosophies of roguelites, adventure games, horror and those weird games you find on the internet to create a unique gameplay experience.",
