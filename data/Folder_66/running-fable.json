    "About the game": "Running Fable presents a new take on the racing genre, adding a fresh item placement mechanic that enhances the experience from just going from point A to B, while keeping rounds fast-paced. Each round consists of two phases: Real time item placement Strategically set items and traps all over the map. The other players won’t be able to see your placements until the race starts! Race to the trophy Run, jump, Dodge, fly, and hare your way up to the trophy! Each item placement can drastically change the racetrack, choose between land, water, or air traps. You can even trick your rivals by hiding your traps beneath a bush… the possibilities are endless! Trophy Points + Trap Points = Round Score Build up your total score by reaching the goal as fast as possible, or by placing your traps cunningly. A mix of both is the key to shell ebrate victoriously! Customizable characters Each player can dress up their characters with a great variety of hats, outfits, and taunt animations, even between each round within the online lobby!",
