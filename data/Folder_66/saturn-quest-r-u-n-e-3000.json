    "About the game": "DEVELOPER'S MESSAGE It's difficult for me to write this 'overview', because I do believe that Saturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 is one of the best video games ever created. It's my game number 10 and it's the first time I feel this way about my own work. I DO believe this work is genius. And honestly it's all I want you to know at this point. But, of course, it's my personal opinion and yours may be completely different. So I do recommend you to keep reading this ' overview ' and also read the game's 8-page manual (on you right). It explains the game's mechanics to some extent. Good Luck, Arkhouse Telegraph STORY 'R.U.N.E. is a secret space station orbiting an artificial micro-planet X-5. It was created for illegal experiments on just one particular life form. You.' FEATURES - [ACTION-RTS [A.R.T.S.]] ACTION-RTS battle system is a unique hybrid of multiple genres (more than 2 (or even 3)). Imagine this combination as a base: -Start with your classic Zelda-style Boss Arena -now add some very simplified RTS ( Real Time Strategy ) mechanics similar to classic strategy games like Dune 2 (but again - very simplified - please, don't expect deep strategy on a one-screen ' Boss Arena '... yet !). There are 10 ARTS Battles in total (in R.U.N.E. 3000). There are 7 + more battles in other styles. - [MINI-GAMES / MODES] Variety. Saturn Quest has variety. More than 10 game-play modes and their combinations, different perspectives, forms, space ships, etc! Note: variety and quantity are two different words. SQ R3000 is not a long game. It's 'wide', not 'long'. + - Asystematic Game-Design (If you have never heard about it - it's all right! Nobody's using it! ...but I do. ADDITIONAL INFO - [SATURN QUEST SAGA] Saturn Quest is an Alien Space Opera , containing multiple episodes that can be played in any order. R.U.N.E. 3000 is a sequel to the previous episode and a prequel to the very first. It is actually recommended to play first. In all Saturn Quest games you play as Captain Navigator , the last Saturnian looking for Saturn. - [DEVELOPER] Ark House Telegraph/Ark House Telegnosis is a one guy with a laptop and internet.",
