    "About the game": "Note: This game is compatible with Xbox One/360 controllers. Seasons of the Sorcerer is a top-down action game set to Antonio Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons.” Severo, an apprentice sorcerer, is on a journey to reunite with his master. Along the way, he must contend with roving bands of mercenaries, the Papal Armies, and rival sorcerers in his year-long journey across early Renaissance Italy. Each level is set to and inspired by a different movement of Antonio Vivaldi's 'Four Seasons.” Features: Control, trap, and overwhelm your foes with Severo's diverse selection of spells. Weaponize your environment by launching boulders, burning wooden structures, and even causing trees to thrash at your enemies. Interact with a cast of compelling, quirky, and complex characters on your journey through the seasons. Find and channel the hidden spirits of long-deceased sorcerers to further upgrade your skills.",
