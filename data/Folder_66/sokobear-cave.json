    "About the game": "Bear’s job takes him to a massive cave, with 40 rooms. Inside the mine, he will find precious gems next to cheap crystals and some easily breakable rocks. To complete his task, solve the enigma on how to move the gems to their proper place! This is a brand new place for Bear, but a familiar job. Gems need to be separated into holes, so roll them carefully around to do it! Oh these? They are cheap crystals, go ahead and break any that are on your way. Just remember they may be useful on your task! Bear needs to gather the blue rocks. The other colours just break too easy. No good for sales. And they do not make Bear's job easier. Pay close attention to how they break and block the passage. Precious gems sorted, time to explore a new cave!",
