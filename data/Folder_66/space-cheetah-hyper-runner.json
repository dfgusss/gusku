    "About the game": "Welcome to the Hyper Games ! Plug into your space cheetah to: - Surf falling solar panels, ride passing satellites, play low G space soccer, and gain enough speed to ramp across entire levels. All in glorious 3D through a first-person POV. - Follow the route markers, or blaze your own trail! All the levels are sandboxes, you're never forced to follow a set route. So many shortcuts to discover, it's a speed runner's dream! - Race against the clock to get YOUR callsign on the level leaderboard! - Groove to an incredible soundtrack, including an uptempo racing mix and a downtempo Chill Cheetah mix. - Oh? Not feeling the need for speed!? No worries! Story Mode lets you casually explore each level, hunting for Ghost Node anomalies. Each one unlocks a memory (or is it a precognition?) about the Traveler’s mysterious journey through the solar system. 4 UNIQUE LOCATIONS Race through speed parks dotted across the solar system: - Earth: Scale the AI submind pyramids floating above the cherry blossom haze of Neo Tokyo. Tear through the swiss-cheese glacial melt near the AL1 North Pole megastructure. Tackle the infamous Launchtube circuit suspended in Earth’s upper atmosphere. - Mars: Show off your skills in the Mars Experimental Zone, in an abandoned gravworks facility, and at the peak of Olympus Mons. - Space: Beat the SpaceY CEO’s best time in an infamous speedway built from space junk, careen down the solar panel circuit in far Jupiter orbit, or go satellite hopping from a mined out asteroid. - Cyberspace: Levels only an AI could dream up…anti-grav donuts, repurposed spare parts, mini-planetoid spheres, and everyone’s favorite Joburg AI Supercity Circuit! The levels never box you in - you're free to ignore the route markers and take as many shortcuts as you like. Anything goes in the quest to shave valuable seconds off your run time! MULTIPLE GAME MODES Choose from 4 unique game modes: - Classic Solo (the official Hyper Games standard!): Reach your points target, then sprint to the finish line. - Race to 100: Get 100 points however you want as fast as possible within the time limit. - Time Trial: Race to the finish line as fast as you can! Can you beat the SpaceY CEO's best time? Good luck! - Story Mode: Find your personal zen with the Chill Cheetah playlist while freely searching for hidden Ghost Nodes. Learn about humanity’s progress in these cyberbrain downloads: the first global AI system, teleporter colonies on Mars, and the hard problem of eternal life. Enough said! Plug into your space cheetah right away :)",
