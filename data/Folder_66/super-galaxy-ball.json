    "About the game": "Fast Paced Gravity Defying Action Super Galaxy Ball is a gravity defying 3D platformer set in space with an amazing electronic soundtrack. Navigate your way through each level by double jumping, climbing and sticking to walls to dodge any obstacles in your path to reach the finish. Unlock new skins by completing achievements and race for the fastest time by yourself or online with friends. Powerful Built-in Level Editor The built-in level editor allows you to create levels that are out of this world. Instead of choosing from a set list of pre-sized building blocks, the built-in level editor allows you to dynamically scale all regular blocks to any size, allowing them to fit perfectly wherever you need them. There are also tons of obstacles and behaviors to choose from, each of which contain multiple options that can be tweaked to enhance level design. Play With Friends Race against friends online or through LAN in lobbies of up to 16. The hosting player can choose any campaign or custom level they have on their device. This even includes levels that only the hosting player has downloaded! This allows everyone to easily share their levels with each other online without the need for downloading them first.",
