    "About the game": "When the world falls apart, what will you make with the ruins? The Archipelago is a visual novel about brewing tea. The teas you choose determine who you encounter in the midst of a vibrant and changing world. The game takes place in a floating archipelago. Once a single island, thirty years ago it broke into pieces, separating lovers and families. Those who remain can communicate only through the Messengers: flying mail deliverers with lofty ambitions of their own. You make tea for whoever needs it, and in exchange ask only to listen in on their conversations. Depending on the flavours in your brew, different people show up to your café, giving you the chance to witness different dialogues - and to watch from different perspectives as the Archipelago's inhabitants contend with trauma, change and hope.",
