    "About the game": "The Classrooms The Classrooms is a procedural, liminal-space, found-footage, survival horror game. In 1996, Robert Chen took his VHS camcorder to the newly-condemned local public school to investigate the disappearances of multiple students, including his younger sister. However shortly after entering the premises, he finds himself lost in a senseless and seemingly infinite maze of halls and classrooms. Discover the contents of the tape he left behind. Explore The Classrooms and discover the various anomalies it contains; from malicious entities, to harmless oddities. And remember, it's different every time you play, so your found footage is uniquely yours. Procedural World The world of The Classrooms is fully procedural and different every time you play. Billions of possible layouts and procedural elements ensure a gameplay experience that's always full of surprises. Entities Watch out for the various entities that resides within the world of The Classrooms. Entities range from harmless to extremely dangerous, thorough investigation into their various properties will be paramount if one wishes to survive. Every entity has a deep and unique set of mechanics that differentiates it from all others. Features Proximity Voice: Sound from your input device affects the game world. Making loud noise can reveal your location to certain entities, but maybe you can use your voice to your advantage. Inventory: Find and use various different types of items, codex entries, keys, and equipment. The items available to you might not be the same items available to another. Entities: Discover and survive the unique mechanics of each of the entities. Development Roadmap We are dedicated to improving the game both in breadth and depth. The procedural levels will be given more details and combinations, and new anomalies and entities will be added as development continues. This will allow for many new gameplay situations to arise. Our main focuses are currently: New Entities New Anomalous Objects Improved Procedural Generation New Levels New Story Elements Improved Gameplay Language Localization",
