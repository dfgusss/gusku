A demonic force of evil is attacking you. Build harvesters, and churches, and then defend them with towers so the hearth can survive. But be aware... The longer you survive the more evil forces will try to end you. How many waves of evil will you survive? Feel like you are up to the challenge? You will have to place buildings on the map to gather resources. With that resource you will be able to build towers that will defend your heart from demonic eyes. After each wave of enemies, their numbers will increase. So you will need to be smart and efficient with your placement. The resources you can harvest are stones, wood, and, souls. Master the map and its resources and you will have an excellent chance to survive for a long time. Key Features Strategy Build Resource",
