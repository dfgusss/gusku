The first of a two-part story involving the cursed district of Wight Chapel. Delve back through your memories to relive the harrowing night of terror when you pitted yourself against The Crawling Horror. A choose your own adventure novel in which your choices and actions can lead you to glorious victory...or ignoble defeat. Explore an original story with three challenging game difficulties, unlock hidden lore to better understand the world you enter, and enjoy the artwork you discover in the gallery. This independently produced novel features a dark soundtrack (with optional atmospherics) by Cryo Chamber, as well as over 40 unique page images to unlock. The text of the game has also been recorded by a professional musician and story-teller, making it into an interactive audiobook. Combine your ancestral Heirlooms with the Traits system to customise your Hunter before taking on the horrors which await you. Wight Chapel Dreams includes a significant overhaul of the combat system which make it easier to identify your enemies and their unique abilities, while leaving more space on the page.
