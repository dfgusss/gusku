    "About the game": "The Shadow People is a point and click horror adventure game where you wake up exhausted during finals week. Gathering your things, you head to campus to attend class, and then after sitting through a lengthy lecture, you head back home. After refueling at a gas station on the way back, you're driving alone in the dark and doing your best to keep yourself awake. Suddenly, you think you see someone in the road, and you violently swerve out of the way to avoid them. Unfortunately, your car gets smashed pretty badly in the wreck, leaving you stranded on a lonely section of highway. Your cell phone is unable to get any signal, so you decide to hoof it, looking for any sign of civilization or cell phone signal. You reach a nearby town that you swear used to be just empty grassland. You navigate the silent streets, trying your best to figure out a way back home. Controls: Use the left mouse to click through the game. Select text or objects within the game to perform certain actions. Use the right click during the game to access the pause menu. You can select up to 10 different actions, including the 'Move' action. Below the 'Move' action is a mini-map showing you adjacent rooms you can move to. Clicking on the large dots in the mini-map lets you move around in addition to using the 'Move' action to click on areas on-screen to move to. Hints: - There is no autosave feature. You can save the game by right clicking during the game, and selecting the 'Save Game' menu. There are 3 save slots. Save early, save often! - Certain items that are picked up will affect the game's ending. On the item screen in the pause menu, items with a white border can affect the ending. - There are a total of 5 different endings! Two of the endings are not affected by the item pickups, but are secret endings you can find in the game. Some in-game objects that can be interacted with can be clicked more than once for extra information, so try everything!",
