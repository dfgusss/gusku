    "About the game": "The Temple Of The Adventure Begins The Temple Of is a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler game. It is 3D, procedurally generated, and packed with ancient horror around every corner! Use your torch to find secret passageways, treasures, and mysteries all while avoiding (or seeking?) the supernatural. Explore ever changing environments, from dusty and forgotten tombs to subterranean jungles. Upgrade Your Equipment You will need to use a plethora of tools, including pistols, machine guns, maps, and explosives to gradually navigate yourself to the Temple's core. Everything you carry can (and will) be upgraded as you progress. Better grenades blast through tougher caves. Better guns tear through mightier foes. Beware the Curse From the moment you enter the tomb , darkness will follow. The game's difficulty is a value (the curse) that is directly impacted by the decisions you make. The higher the curse, the spookier (but more rewarding) the game becomes. Creatures (and treasures) will become more abundant. The difficulty (Curse) can be controlled. Seek The Truth Knowledge is also a value that can be accumulated. As knowledge is found, doors are opened, powers bestowed, and ancient languages translated. Search for answers, solve puzzles, earn rewards, advance further beneath the temple. The Final Question Each player who escapes the twentieth tomb is taken to a room where they can virtually contribute to the game's development. Players are given the opportunity to design a chamber to be added into the procedural generation algorithm. Any idea, spanning from a room full of mummies to a dungeon loaded with treasure, can be built.",
