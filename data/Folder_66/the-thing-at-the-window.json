    "About the game": "This game contains flickering/flashing lights and loud noises. The Thing at the Window is a short horror game that was initially developed from December 2018 through October 2019 and then shelved for a few years while we took a break to experiment with other ideas. Please note that while the game is playable it's still in alpha so expect it to be rather rough around the edges. I strongly suggest playing in the dark with headphones for the most immersive experience (which I mean, it's a horror game so that kind of goes without saying). The game can be kind of LOUD at times but that is by design. I don't recommend turning the volume down too much or you won't be able to hear crucial audio cues. You live with your father in the rural American midwest. He left you home alone while he's out of town for the weekend, and you heard on the radio that there's a large storm heading your way. You live in a rather underdeveloped part of the country so you're off the power grid, but fortunately your dad's pretty handy and he's wired up your old farmhouse to a gas generator, which you moved to the basement to keep it out of the storm. The basement smells kind of funny and it's really hazy down there, but it should be okay for now. There's a big fuel tank outside where you can refill your jerry can, and dad refilled it before he left. There's also a big pile of wooden boards out front from when your dad renovated the barn over the summer, so you can use those to board up the windows just in case. The storm should be here soon and you're as prepared as you can be, but still you feel uneasy; something's not quite right... you feel as if something's lurking out there, watching. Your goal is to survive three nights of the Thing trying to force its way into your home, by barricading doors and windows. The thing really doesn't like light, so you can drive it away with your rechargeable flashlight. You can also 'reinforce' parts of the house by turning lights on, which will slow the thing's attacks at the cost of draining more power and needing to refill the generator more frequently.",
