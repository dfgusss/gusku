    "About the game": "TheCube is a 2D arcade game created by 2 people. As it is the first season, the game is only in English and is going to have a lot of changes (in the gameplay, in the graphics ...) . That's a simple speedrun game where you have to finish small labyritnhs in a short time. For this 1st season, it exists 100 levels. On the 40 first, you have to escape from a bot which tries tocatch you. For the 20 after levels, you must finish the level without the bot but with some lasers which are here to steal your time ! And for the last 40 levels, the lasers are black and white, and so the cube can turn white or black to go through the lasers of its colour. it adds to the game of speed. We recommend you to watch the trailer and check some screenshots to discover TheCube better. For the moment, there is only one biom (type of level) on the game but the team is now hard working on different levels they could make and maybe add bosses at the end of levels. The game is always in devlopment and the team is trying to make the game better and better. We hope you are going to have fun ! TheCubeCreators",
