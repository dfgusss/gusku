    "About the game": "Three sisters who are goddesses decide to leave their island to visit Athens in the middle of a war waged by gods, demons and succubi. Survival ultimately becomes their goal as a faction of the gods known as the Olympians seek to destroy them. Tragedy of Medusa is a short linear visual novel with some animations. Estimated game play is less than 1 hour. While based roughly on the ancient Greek myth, Tragedy of Medusa is not the story you remember. This story takes place in a world where gods walk among men, demons run rampant and succubi toy with them all. Tragedy of Medusa respects the major events of the classic tale, but tweaks the world in which those events take place as well as the motivation of the characters behind those events. Tragedy of Medusa is a prequel to Euryale's Gambit .
