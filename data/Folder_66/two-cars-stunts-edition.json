    "About the game": "What do you know about synchronization? Here is an example when not everything depends on you. This game presents the perfect image of teamwork. Your car is linked by a chain to another damaged car. Using your leadership skills, you will have to reach the end point keeping a calculated distance between you, without breaking the chain. It is not about simply towing the car, because the conditions do not allow it. The road being with various obstacles and it could happen that one of the cars is required to do stunt elements to reach the end. Communicate with each other, that's the only way you'll be successful. Good Luck ! Game Features : - 2 Game Modes (Chain Cars, Impossible Tracks) - 2 cars linked by a chain - Each group of cars has multiple levels",
