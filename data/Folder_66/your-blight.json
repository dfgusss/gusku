    "About the game": "‘Your Blight’ is a turn-based dark fantasy RPG where you have to survive in a city blocked by the appearance of a vampire. ■Story Making The challenge at hand is to hold out until rescued. However, players will face more choices in the city. You may be looking for a way out somewhere in the city, or you may leave all of this behind and act to uncover the truth or the secrets of the world. Survivors with diverse stories are struggling to survive all over the city. They will either welcome or wary players, depending on their circumstances. Players can intervene in their story if they wish, and further influence their fate. These choices and decisions come together to complete the ending of ‘Your Blight’. The story of ‘Your Blight’ is written by the player. ■Turn-Based RPG The streets of the city were destroyed by monsters summoned by vampires. Above the ruins, plague-spreading infects, self-interested outlaws, and heretics are searching for victims. The city is full of threats. It is difficult for the player to face such adversity alone. Therefore, 'Signa' has 10 collaborators that can be recruited. Players can form a party of three with two collaborators to fight enemies. Over 100 pieces of equipment with unique skills are scattered throughout the city. Find the equipment and magic that suits you. Create combinations suitable for enemies and situations. Take advantage of your enemies' strengths and weaknesses to lead the battle to your advantage. ■Survival The survivors are hungry, tense, and blighted by vampire blood. And so are you. ‘Your Blight’ has three gauges that affect your survival. These are 'fullness', 'mental', and 'blight'. Players must find food, calm their minds, and purify Blight. Collect supplies as you explore over 20 locations. Players can enhance their facilities to improve the environment of their settlements. A comfortable bed, good food, and efficient potions will help you survive.",
