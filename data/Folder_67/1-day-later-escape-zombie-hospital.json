    "About the game": "You woke up in a hospital ward in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. Your task is to survive the first day and get out of the zombie hospital. Use your uninfected superior mind and fool rotten-brain zombies. Stealth mode is your primary weapon. Key Features: 3D Top-Down hardcore zombie stealth game. Run away from zombies, fight them, distract throwing cans, fool them switching light, barricade doors - there are always many ways to go through the level . Explore dark levels with different lighting. A thrilling storyline, multiple characters to play. To go through level, you need to find key and get to exit door. This is usually not so easy! :) IMPORTANT: This is a puzzle game, not Kill 'Em All, weapons added just to give player a chance to free himself when he made an error. Every level can be completed without fighting (see Walkthroughs on Youtube), player just need to think a little and try the alternative way. Every level can be completed in many ways - throwing cans, switch on/off light, drive zombie to food, etc. In few levels zombie have the key and you need to kill him, but his health reduced to make kill easy.",
