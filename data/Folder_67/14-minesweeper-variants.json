    "About the game": "The title explains what it is. Features: 1. 14 minesweeper variants, each with four difficulties and hundreds of levels. 2. Learning new rule sets and their unique logic. 3. In case you need to take notes, there are built-in drawing tools. 4. The hint system tells you where to focus on when you get stuck, while it does not simply tell the solution. 5. Every level can be completed by logic. Guessing is not required. 6. The puzzles are procedurally generated. We tried a few programming and game design techniques in this game. I promise it doesn't feel like any other procedural generated game before. 7. And there's more to explore.",
