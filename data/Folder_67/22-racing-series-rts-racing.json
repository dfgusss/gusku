    "Name": "22 Racing Series | RTS-Racing",
    "Release date": "Nov 30, 2022",
    "About the game": "Built upon real simulated physics, these are future vehicle technologies capable of 1,000+km/h combined with; Track capture Resource collection Mid-race vehicle upgrades And track abilities All played out on extreme full 360 degree track designs and an online racing tournament complete with prizes. We also have plans to open 22RS up to game modding and community built assets. So if you have some ideas for future physics racing vehicles, you can make them, if you have some ideas for some fully 3d track designs that you'd like to try out, you can build them, or if you want to take our suite of physically based vehicles (did we mention we support bikes and maglev?) and unique strategy elements and make something unique of your own, then we want to help you make that happen. Did you ever hear that an F1 car could theoretically drive upside down? Well, we tested it, and proved it. But it wasn't fun to drive, so we took it a few steps further and developed a fully adaptable vehicle setup ecu that could adjust; Aerodynamics, camber, toe, spring compression, tyre pressure, etc based on the vehicles velocity and orientation. Trust us, that little bit extra downforce when you're upside down comes in handy ;) Welcome also to 'Future Physics Racing'! We built our own proprietary engine ‘RevGen’ so that we could make this possible by giving you the high frame and physics rates needed for a silky smooth physics handling experience at these insanely high speeds. '22 Racing Series' is currently available in early-access. If you like getting into new games early and like to give feedback on the direction of a game's development, then we'd love to see you in the game and in our community. If you prefer to play games at final release only, then we welcome you to add ‘22 Racing Series’ to your Wishlist to get notified when we launch v1.0. * Try in VR with our six axis motion simulation support if you dare",
