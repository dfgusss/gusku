    "About the game": "This project is a simulation of a fractal family unit or a revolving home structure between mom, daughter, and daughter’s girlfriend. In this game, Days and Nights manifest as a color yellow, which is born out of their 49 days of cohabitation after the funeral. You are here to look after a new pattern with 21 boxes made of quotes on trauma transforming techniques. Let the record desensitized and reprocessed. How to Play There are 4 types of buttons to click. Time on TOP | Move to the next scene when it's unlocked. Puzzle on MIDDLE | Reorganize the boxes on your own SYMMETRICAL SYMBOLS. Guide on LEFT and RIGHT | Words must be reorganized by your play and belief. Cinema Mode by RIGHT-CLICK anywhere | You can have a whole view without UI buttons. Left-click anywhere to come back. Press F12 to collect a screenshot while playing or press esc to quit the game. Running Time Between 3 and 21 minutes. It can also take forever as this game is fundamentally an endless alarm clock or symbol maker .
