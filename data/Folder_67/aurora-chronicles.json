World of Orellia A Female rogue by the name of Aurora, A Half Demon finds herself on a wanted list after killing the Great Kings last line to the throne, his teen son. You must scramble and fight enemies from the world of Orellia looking to take home the big bounty of bringing your corpse back to the Queen for revenge. Aurora is a S tier bounty hunter who grew up in the slums of Orellia’s Kingdom. She travels around the realm, taking bounties ever since she was a young child. She’s a cold hearted killer. Aurora never gave a damn about anything in this world besides collecting her bounties and herself. She was known as the best hunter in the realm and every warrior as well as demon knew with that comes big rewards so they will kill her at all costs. Skill Tree Aurora will have opportunities to upgrade and better equip herself with skill points which we call 'Soul Offerings'. You obtain them by defeating enemies followed by spending them when the Soul Offer Demon Sapphire spawns in the game. Also remember the more enemies defeated the more powerful you grow. Magic System Utilize your magical powers to defeat and kill enemies, hone the skills of the elements to see how long you can survive. Magic Effects In the game Aurora will be able to apply elemental effects to enemies for example during a PyroBurst you will see an enemy turn red showing that they are burning and take extra damage, also if you hit them with Dragon Frostbite this will cause them to turn blue and slow them down, but be wary some enemies can do the same to you. Cancellation System Abilities and Attacks will be able to be cancelled out by performing another action, for example when you strike with a basic attack you could for instance let it fully play out or you could perform said action such as a teleport or ability to cancel out the basic attack and transition to said ability, this can come in handy when youve made a mistake but you must think quick some mistakes could cost you your life Screenshots are not final and subject to change",
