    "About the game": "WARNING: This game may trigger seizures from people with photosensitive epilepsy. It is left to the discretion of the player. IMPORTANT NOTE: The game focuses on exploration and slowly builds up tension to create a deeper and more meaningful experience. The story of the game can be very disturbing as it is supported by light, loud and sudden sounds. Take into account that it makes you feel the feeling of fear too much and that it is a psychologically difficult game. Demon sorcery 2 is a first-person psychological horror game. Environment The game is played in a village environment. It is a gloomy environment, you are alone in the village, but the interesting thing is, where and why do these voices come from outside of you? You will feel your mind disappear in an interesting way. The plot of the game In this game, which is a sequel to the first game inspired by real events in 1993, Iblis, the demon we thought we had sent to hell actually haunted our village. Let's see if you can destroy the demon cult that has taken the village captive. Supernatural beings The jinn, the living dead, who do not always know where and when they will appear... Developer's comment about the game The demon cannot harm you physically, but it can inflict deep wounds on your thinking and psychology. We recommend that people who are afraid of the dark, have a heart condition, and are afraid of being alone should not play alone. IMPORTANT NOTE: This event, which actually happened in 1993, was made into a game based on what the main character tells. We have not been able to find support for the voice-over of this game because of the thought that there is a curse in the game, since there was a case of a cleric who died while he was trying to help in the development of the subject of this game and would support its vocalization, and then there was another case of a cleric who experienced the same event, and we have done it with our own means.",
