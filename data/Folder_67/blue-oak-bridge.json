    "About the game": "Washed up on a strange shore, this is your chance to make a fresh start on a cosy farm. The charming villagers of Eloria welcome you into their peaceful lives, but you soon find there’s trouble brewing. Now your friends need your help. A powerful magic infects the rivers and forests, monsters overrun the old mines, and the once-bustling Blue Oak Library lies in ruins. Who owns the library? You find yourself tangled in a tale of forbidden magic, ancient secrets, and a quest to unite Eloria when Queen Isa and the intrepid entrepreneur Alonzo clash over this very question. Of course, you can give it all up for a simple life on your farm. Grow crops, tend to livestock, and forage and fish across the island. Everything you make on your farm and discover on the island can be sold, brewed in potions, gifted to friends, donated to the library, or used to upgrade your weapons and tools. Use your profits to customise your character, expand your farm, and care for your livestock and pets. There are over 30 characters, each with unique stories, and 15 romanceables to date, fall in love with and marry. Features  Crops Grow over 40 types of crops, including a variety of seeds, flowers, fruits, fantasy crops and vegetables that vary with the seasons. Donate your harvest to the Plantlife and Wildlife Compendiums in the library. Perhaps you’d prefer to take your time to convert your crops into pickles, jams, juices and wines. Of course, you can always sell or gift whatever you grow to your friends. Farm Animals Buy chicks, calves, lambs and piglets from Cedric and nurture them into adult livestock. Be sure to take good care of your livestock and pet them often. The better you treat your animals, the better products they produce. Add special produce to your harvest by raising fantasy animals from Elorian myths, such as the Gokey Crab, Rose-Nosed Eakey and Oakipine. Adopt a pet to follow you on your journey and keep you company on your farm, even when you’re planting potatoes. Choose from dogs, cats or the Elorian fennec fox. Potions &amp; Fantasy Find Hazel, the witch in the forest, to uncover the secrets of the Great Witches of Eloria and brew potions. Potions have unique gameplay effects, such as teleportation, replenishing your health and influencing the weather to alter your farm. Inspired by our favorite fantasy tales, we have filled Blue Oak Bridge with rich and exciting lore full of magical mysteries and ancient myths. Character Customization Embrace your creativity and dress how you wish! Visit the local tailor and barber to take your pick of a wide range of costumes, accessories and hairstyles. Perhaps you’ll wear a pocket watch or a don Panama hat. Many characters have special costumes to unlock and show off new friendships with style, such as the chicken outfit, Welsh Dragon costume and Princess Nandi’s ballroom gown. Farm Customization Decorate your farmhouse down to the last detail—from door to roof to siding! For a picture-perfect farm, visit Enzo the carpenter to build barns and silos. Whether you create a practical farm or a cozy croft, it’s always best to be creative. Gather resources and collect recipes to craft new items and decorations. You can craft brewing stations to brew teas and coffees, bee houses to make honeys or convertors to make wines, jams and cheeses. Use your converters to produce more profitable products, taking you one step closer to building your dream farm. Elorians Make friends with over 30 characters! Give them gifts and complete unique quests to see their stories. Will you uncover their deepest, darkest secrets along the way? There’s only one way to find out… 11 romanceables are waiting for that special someone to go on dates and fall in love. If you’re ready for more, then visit Sophie and Ezra at the Beautiful Bureau to customize and decorate your perfect wedding. Eloria From the hustle and bustle of the village to the mysterious mines, we’ve packed Eloria with exciting beauty spots that’ll have you coming back for more. At the center of it all stands the Ancient Blue Oak in the library.  Tools, Mining, Ores Dig deep into the Elorian mines with your trusty tools to gather copper, iron, gold and obsidian. Use your ores for crafting, quests or to smelt into lucrative ingots. You should also visit Marcelo and use ores to upgrade your tools if you wish to explore the deeper levels of the mines. The deeper you delve, the more ores you’ll find. But be careful, legend has it the mines are home to countless ancient monsters. Combat There are many dangerous monsters in the mines of Eloria. The further you delve, the more you’ll need to study their behaviors to defeat them and earn monster drops. Choose your perfect sword, axe or bow and master the three combat styles: one-handed, two-handed and ranged. Learn defensive maneuvers and special attacks to match the strength of your enemies and overcome the most perilous situations. Remember to upgrade your weapons and take your potions. You don’t want to go up against a Lost Knight with only your rusty sword. Trust us. Fishing The rivers and beach of Eloria are teeming with sealife, so take a break from your farm to show off your fishing talents. Old salty dog Kipp will be impressed if you catch every variety.  Upgrade your old fishing rod to catch over 50 species of fish that change with the seasons, including legendary fish that take all your skills to catch. Donate your catch to the Sealife Compendium in the library for research or sell it if you prefer to make money. Kipp has spotted contaminated fish all over Eloria and needs your help to heal them, so reel them in and save the seas from environmental harm.",
