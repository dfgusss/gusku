    "About the game": "The Carpe Diem Project is a game where you must be on guard around every corner! You can enjoy it alone, without teammates, while you have to kill hordes of enemies to survive. For this survival game, you need gaming skills, courage, a good dose of patience, and a fancy to kill enemies to overcome even the most difficult challenges. In return, you will get a large map with 5 areas, game experience, surprising moments, different types of weapons, multiple types of characters, and various types of unique enemies. Would you dare to play this game? Can you survive? Can you kill as many enemies as possible and achieve the highest score? KEY FEATURES MAP – The game map is divided into 5 areas, each area representing a different part of the city. We made it a point to make every area look as realistic as possible. CHARACTERS - We offer a choice of several types of characters. Choose to play as a female character or beat your enemies as a male character. WEAPONS - The choice of weapon is up to you. You have a large variety of weapons to choose from. In addition to weapons, you can also use brute force and punch enemies, but not all of them! ENEMIES - You are being chased by 'ordinary' enemies, but also by enemies with special characteristics, which can be a challenge for someone and which you have to deal with. DIFFICULTY - You have several difficulty levels to choose from. They will test your gaming skills from a third-person perspective. The higher the level, the higher the number of enemies. And the enemies are getting stronger and more aggressive. ACID STORM - A forgotten experiment supposed to help civilization stop spreading a contagion around the world got out of control. Now you have to avoid the consequences of this experiment and stay alive until the experiment ends. ENRAGE - The longer you fight the enemies, the more they adapt to you and become more resistant and aggressive.",
