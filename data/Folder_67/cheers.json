    "About the game": "Cheers! Is a 2 player game! You can play with one keyboard and one controller or two controllers! A couple of quirky scientists work tirelessly in the laboratories of the world's largest research center on a formula that could change the fate of the entire planet. However, one step away from a solution, a freak accident destroys the entire universe, leaving the two scientists in limbo, with only a handful of elements. Will they be able to restore the universe as we know it? Cheers is a cooperative puzzle party-game for two players who will have to coordinate and work together to combine pairs of elements and create new ones. The game features two modes: - the Sandbox mode, in which players can experiment with combinations in order to complete the entire catalog of elements; - the Challenge mode, in which the goal is to recreate the requested element in a frantic timed challenge. With 20 customizable skins and 14 different maps, each with its own unique difficulties and challenges, Cheers is a colorful and exciting game that will keep you glued to the screen.",
