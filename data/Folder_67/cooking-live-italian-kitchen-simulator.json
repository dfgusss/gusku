Jane and her cooking show are the last hope to save the restaurant and make Leah’s dream come true! Episode 3. Get Cool Get Cool is a retro drive-in cafe in Atlanta, USA. After college, a happily married couple returns to the city of their childhood to buy a drive-in cafe and breathe new life into the place where they met. But nothing goes as planned, and the once-happy couple is facing a relationship crisis. A junk-food company is ready to buy the place for a song. Jane is there to turn things around and make the drive-in cafe more popular than ever before, so the couple can work together and be happy again. Episode 5. Shell Shell is a seafood restaurant in Tokyo, Japan. Kaito hears about the sale of an old aquarium complex, and he and his wife Asami decide to buy it. Kaito’s dream is to make a restaurant where Asami can put her many years of experience as a restaurateur and culinary ideas to use. But things get complicated when they are forced to sell their house to pay their bills. Desperate for help, Kaito asks Jane to come, hoping she might make a difference.",
