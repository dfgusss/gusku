    "About the game": "Covid killer is a first person shooter-survival game in real time (3D UE4). Background Covid19 is in the pandemic stage since 2020. You must act to prevent the spread of the virus. Medicine has found the vaccine, science has found the cure: Miniaturizing a soldier and introducing it into a patient's body to prevent the virus from entering his airways. Your mission is to prevent the Covid from infecting you or your patient. You play as a soldier, who must inject a new vaccine directly into the Covid viruses that will appear during missions. Science has miniaturized you and your partner, and you will be introduced into different parts of a patient's airways that you must protect. The scenario proposes different parts of the body depending on the evolution of the game. The viruses will attack in waves, over a period of time. You and your patient must not be contaminated by the viruses. For this, your rifle with vaccine syringes will be your main weapon. Only your skill, strategy, and stamina are left to survive and make the best score . Take revenge - revenge us The game currently offers two game modes: the scenario mode and the survival mode. The scenario mode The protocol involves the disintegration of your body and its reintegration into the body of a sleeping patient. The initial mission sends you into the nostril of a patient. Your partner will be reintegrated into the other nostril. The objective is to prevent the passage of viruses, by shooting them syringes containing a vaccine that will kill the affected virus. One of the particularities of the gameplay is that we are in the medical world, and that the pharmaceutical products take time to act. As a consequence, the vaccine will take a little time to act, for each affected virus, which will give a unique gameplay. You have to anticipate the movements of the viruses, aim them as soon as possible, and as accurately as possible, in anticipation of the action time of the vaccines. The difficulty of the game is that the more you progress, the more numerous and resistant the viruses will be. There is a large number of levels. You will have the possibility to increase the capacities of your avatar and/or to increase the effectiveness of the vaccine according to your progression in the game. At the end of each mission, you will be evaluated according to your efficiency, your accuracy and your health status. The score will be accompanied by a number of stars more or less important. These stars will allow you to unlock improvements to your avatar or the antivirus. Only the best players will be able to get the highest scores. The objective of this game is to succeed in surpassing yourself, persevering, and improving your own scores to compete with the best players in the world. Survival mode This specific mode allows you to face a very large quantity of viruses, always more numerous and difficult to destroy. The number of syringes in your possession is unlimited as long as you manage to reload from the ammunition box available on the level. This mode allows you to earn stars, the game's currency, which give access to some bonuses in the game (specific charger, medicine, ...). The goal is to stay alive as long as possible, to get the best scores and show them to all the other players !",
