    "About the game": "These are machine translation The game can only be played in full screen. Please do not use F3 and F4, which will make the game non full screen. In this state, there will be missing or wrong maps. In addition to the interface and menu, this game has no text, only animation or mapping tips, so there are no language barriers. Please rest assured to play. Plot overview: The protagonist 'cowardice' wakes up in his own home, but reveals discord in familiarity and strangeness in peace. It seems that something is ready to move in the dark, and when the door is opened by external forces, he finds it unsafe Explore the past of 'cowardice' like fragments Five chapters, four chapters transition, three maps of different styles, and three things of fear that 'cowardice' has been embodied. In the process of being chased by things of fear, you can see the most impressive 'home, hospital and school' of cowardice. The exploration process is accompanied by bad music. The background music of each chapter is different, and each monster also has six different bad music. Of course, a little simple to outrageous decryption, an appropriate amount of death CG and a little chase war are added. This is a horror game, so there are a lot of maps, but pay attention to the comparison with the 'pleasant horror' in the first three chapters, The latter two chapters are more frightening. In addition to the first chapter, each chapter has something new. In order to keep this aftertaste, I won't spoiled the small program. In short, it is a different mechanism, but the mechanism is not the main body of the chapter. home In the first chapter, the protagonist wakes up from bed. The room is very familiar, but there is something more or maybe less. The most important thing is that what she fears is gone, but when she approaches the door of freedom step by step, what is close together. Note: when fear comes, all you can do is escape and hide. hospital After escaping from fear and darkness, 'cowardice' came to this familiar place. She often had to come here. Even though she hated and wanted to forget it, it was still one of the places that impressed her most. She had to remember that a person with two faces here, even if he had only been in contact for a few seconds, even if he was bound at that time, even if there were doctors and security personnel beside him in the past, it still caused great trauma to the 'cowardly' young heart. Note: what can blur a smile school Cowardice spent most of her life here. This is the place she is most familiar with, but it also means that she suffered the most pain here. There is not only one fear to face here. Where thick smoke is everywhere, the Queen's ridiculous 'subordinates' will follow her and be careful of the pranks of those disgusting guys. As the end of the first half, and in order to push the story to a climax, there is a novel meeting here. An unexpected guy appears. He can smell the full malice far away. It is not a thing of fear. 'Cowardice' is the most familiar and stranger to her. Note: do you like looking in the mirror? In addition to three different styles of maps, there are two variants, ruins and prison ruins Well, now that the card has been displayed, why hide it? Witness the erosion of malice, witness the disintegration of everything known, the memory will be distorted, the fear will be amplified, the small cards will be exhausted, and the trump card will come! I guess it's not easy to deal with two guys at the same time, and it's still an 'enhanced version'. Don't worry. It's a dead end to be caught anyway. Why pressurize yourself? Note: do you still have an impression of the useless things in the past? prison It's not easy to stick here. Now they're all here, but as long as they survive the darkest moment before dawn Oh, there seems to be a 'final showdown'? I hope it's easy to deal with two monsters at the same time. Congratulations. Now we have to face three, and be careful of the trap and sudden attack of 'that guy'. Note: don't look, don't listen, don't talk, don't think Thing of fear The so-called things of fear are monsters embodied by the most feared things in the 'cowardly' heart, but the things of fear in the main story are not so simple. They seem to be made by living people. The bad news is that there are only three challenges to face. Tyranny - this red demon with a big belly is not very good tempered. Be careful to be beaten up by him. Joys and sorrows - this gray guy has two faces? Be careful of the smiling face! Smoker - uh You like JK? The 'Fairy' with thick smoke and long hair is not easy to provoke. Maybe you can see it from the tubes wrapped around her neck and sharp edged hands? Good news, they all have two stages! Note: there is a fourth monster in the early version, which is a big spider. Considering my friends who are afraid of this thing like me, I finally deleted it. Between acts Between acts is a small transition between two acts, which tells short contents that are irrelevant to the main line and are not highly operational. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Tip: what you think is right Have a nice day",
