    "About the game": "Cowboys and Zombies... What can go wrong? Prove that you are the fastest gunslinger in the old west by literally shooting with your bare hands. You have to be quick or the zombies will eat you... The game has two modes: Story mode and Hands tracking or Time mode. In the story mode the player can move freely around the stage, he will have to find the way to go to the next level. In hands tracking mode, the player remains static in one position, having to survive the zombie attack for a certain amount of time. You can use the Quest, Quest 2 and Quest Pro goal cameras, to play, you do not need controllers. Playing without controllers is less accurate, but can be more fun... Designed for Pico 4, Oculus Meta Quest 2, Valve Index, Pimax, HTC Vive and Quest Pro PC-VR, Hands Tracking Mode.",
