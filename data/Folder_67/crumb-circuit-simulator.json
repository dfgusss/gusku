    "About the game": "Interactive and immersive learning Our modern world is dominated by electronics. With a diverse range of careers in electronics available for young and adult minds alike, CRUMB offers an easy to use and interactive introduction to electronic circuitry. Fully realised in 3D, you can construct prototype circuits as you would at the workbench without the risk of terminal component failure or the hassle of ordering individual components. Large Catalogue that continues to grow Infinite combinations and possibilities Version 1.0 of CRUMB comes with a great selection of starter components to allow you to jump straight in to creating prototype circuits. With the catalogue available it is possible to study the workings of transistors &amp; audio filtering, all the way to programming an EEPROM to run a basic program. For the beginner, it is possible to learn and understand the basics of interactivity, and for the enthusiast it is possible to analyse and perfect prototypes before constructing real world models. Using the built-in oscilloscope and analysis views, it is possible to see clearly the interaction between components from within the wires themselves Community driven development CRUMB will continually be updated and expanded beyond version 1.0. Through community feedback and suggestion, there will be many more components and features added in the future. If you have a suggestion for CRUMB please visit the forum and leave a message",
