    "About the game": "⚔️ Brutal Combat - Engage in stamina-based combat where you have to dodge, swing, shoot, and cast at the right time, or you'll get your face stabbed clean off. 🔥 Epic Boss Fights - Overcome adversity and face off against Midrhada's Guardians - beings of great power that have fed on the life force of the Cursed for 100 years. 🏹 Play to your Strengths - Begin the game with a misfit that strikes your fancy (Gladiator, Assassin, or Mage), then spice up your build with your favorite arrangement of weapons, proficiencies, skills, and spells. Your base class is just a starting point . 🧭 Explore the last Remnants of Humanity - On your journey through our handcrafted world you'll find monsters, traps, puzzles, locks, keys, secrets, vistas, and more! 📜 Game Features Your journey is your own; you must venture out and find your path without quest markers or compass blips. Choices and consequences are permanent; progress is saved automatically. Our world seamlessly loads from one area to the next to keep you fully immersed. Defeat horrors, collect loot, and grow stronger as you move from one challenge to the next. Varying weapons and skills make up a unique play experience with several combos for you to try. ☠️ This World Burns . Nearly all who still survive are magically enslaved by the demigoddess, Midrhada. Whether it is luck, strength of will, or some blessing of the Gods, you've managed to resist the Curse for now. The only way to achieve true freedom is to dethrone Midrhada. You must travel to every edge of the Viridian Empire, find her guardians, and slay them in order to cleave a path to the Empress herself. You'll face countless enemies and beings of incredible power. Your tortuous path is laid with traps and obscured by tests of skill and wit. Can you defeat Midrhada and overcome this Curse of Eternity ?",
