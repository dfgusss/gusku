    "About the game": "This game is a Strategy RPG where you fight by moving each unit. Use the abilities of the various units to defeat the enemy. Use the cursor to select a stage on the world map. In each stage, you move your units and fight repeatedly to advance. Each unit can act in the following order: move, attack. When you attack, you will gain experience, and when you have accumulated a certain number of experience, your level will increase and your status will improve. When you reach a certain level, you will be able to learn new techniques and magic. Techniques and magic can be used by consuming SP. Recovery units can heal instead of attacking, and gain experience through recovery. Select 'End Turn' to switch to the enemy's turn. Defeat the enemy boss to clear the stage. In stages with companion characters, if they are still alive when the stage is cleared, they will be added to your team. You can replay stages that have been cleared once. You can check the status of each unit on the menu screen and return to the title screen. You can use the keyboard or PS4 or XBOX360 controller to control the game. Saving is done automatically. Japanese and English languages are supported, and can be switched on the title screen. Press F1 to go full screen.",
