    "About the game": "Flock of Dogs is a quirky, top-down, action and adventure game about riding flying dogs with your friends. Inspired by storybooks, cartoons, and neighborhood parks, the game is split into two main experiences. They are the Minigame Park and the Flight to the Festival. THE MINIGAME PARK (free-to-play) Joust on dogback, feed your whale, race on tracks you design Customize your dog at the Build-A-Pup 3000 Toss squeaky balls, pop balloons, and mow the lawn Help the grumpy park ranger uncover sacred park secrets THE FLIGHT TO THE FESTIVAL (DLC coming soon!) Go on a co-op, procedurally generated, road trip through the sky Feed and water your dogs and puppies Descend into caves, battle across the Blue Blob Lands, pick up hitchhikers Pilot a friendly skywhale, use its large belly to stash your loot In the world of Flock of Dogs, there is an annual Festival. So each time you set out from your home in a treehouse on an island in the sky, you're headed for that year's Festival. Each run has a shuffled mix of creatures and challenges. I suggest bringing along some friends! Note that the Flight to the Festival DLC won't be available until some time after the Minigame Park, but a taste of the adventure is available in the demo. Online and/or local multiplayer for up to 8 players Two players on one keyboard Solo play Full controller support Host games or browse and join others Drop-in/drop-out at any time Furthermore, when you buy the Flight to the Festival DLC, you receive one Friend Slot... A Friend Slot allows one of your friends to join you in the Flight to the Festival DLC for free! It's not exactly 2-for-1, but in some ways, it's better. One Friend Slot comes with the Flight to the Festival DLC Invite any friend (and each time, it can be a different friend) Buy additional Friend Slots Friends who own the DLC do not take up a Friend Slot Flock of Dogs is my little dream world. The music was created by my friends and relatives. Wherever and with whomever you play, I hope it's a magical flight. -Max",
