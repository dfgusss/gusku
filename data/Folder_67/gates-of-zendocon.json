    "About the game": "Originally released in 1989, Gates of Zendocon brought the excitement of arcade-style side scrolling shooters to the Atari Lynx handheld console. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. The droids of your old nemesis, the evil spider Zendocon, captured you. Zendocon itself sentenced you to wander its web of deadly universes. Zendocon's universes are connected by a web of transporter gates and alien bases. Zendocon orders its droids to transport you to an alien base on the first of the 51 interconnected universes and to give you a starship. You must survive dangerous universes inhabited by hostile aliens while searching for transporter gates. When you find a transporter gate, fly through the gate into another universe. You will find allies in Zendocon's universes. Aliens held as slaves by Zendocon's minions will help you if you can free them. They will follow your ship, aiding you with strange weapons unlike any you have ever encountered! Will you survive Zendocon's challenge? You must survive! Your reward for success is the chance for sweet revenge – a duel to the death with the evil spider itself! This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
