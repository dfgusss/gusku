    "About the game": "Godbeast Mk.II stars the exiled princess Ysengrimes and her Wolf, on a bloody battle for revenge in this stylish cel-shaded action game. Carve your path through the City of Insomnia and claim the throne. Slay the Council of the Hunt and the Godbeasts, divine animals that act as their guardians and sources of power. This ruling class has entered into an unholy pact for immortal life, a cycle of death and rebirth in an unending night of darkness. The malevolent radiance of the Moon drives the city's inhabitants insane with a lust for bloodshed. KEY FEATURES Fast-paced combat featuring a special combo system where you defeat enemies in timed encounters and shred them to pieces in a shower of blood. Call your Wolf into battle to rip and tear through legions of lunatic monsters. Establish your dominance over the Godbeasts and become Queen of the City. Engage in fierce duels with the Council of the Hunt, your former friends and family. Spare no one, give no quarter. Beautiful cel-shaded visuals, colourful particles and stylish effects as you dash and drive through the dark forests and moonlit highways. It is not required to have played the previous game, The Godbeast , to enjoy this title.
