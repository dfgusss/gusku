    "About the game": "Gray is a first person, psychological survival horror set on the Moon. Playing as Dr. Frederick Gray, you must maintain and refill your depleting 02 and health to stay alive as you navigate Alpha Station and the secretive 'Extended Residency Section'. Use stealth to your advantage as you evade the horrors that await you. With no weapons available to you, you can run... hide in lockers... whatever you must to survive whilst being pursued by an ever raging fire and something much much worse. A story driven game pieced together through collectible voicemails, documents and video logs. The clues are all there as to what is going on, but will Dr. Gray's mental wellbeing hold out long enough to realize what is happening? Burn With Us As We Become One!",
