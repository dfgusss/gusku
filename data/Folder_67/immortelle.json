    "About the game": "Immortelle is an abstract and figurative non-game artwork that illustrates the flights and falls of psychological endurance. It is a personal story told through the paintbrush of Virtual Reality in a fast-paced flux of sound and visual fragments. Warning: Contains some flashing lights and quick camera movement and transitions which may not be suitable for photosensitive people. THE TRIP Contemplate changes of scenes and seasons, pave through evocative empty structures, wade through waves and mountain peaks, and encounter a presence in a vacuum. At times deep, at times shattering, at times peaceful - Immortelle traces the unpredictable range of our own emotions. FEATURES Travel in 6DOF Engage in a unique artistic audiovisual narrative Journey through multiple environnements Experience moments of light interaction Lean back into binaural sound Uncover sensitive states and intense upheavals ABOUT THE ARTIST Line Katcho is a composer and audiovisual artist primarily interested in sound and image as demonstrations of kinetic matter.
