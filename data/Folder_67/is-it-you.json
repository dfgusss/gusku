    "About the game": "The Shady Shiitakes and the Truffle Squad are locked in a deadly feud, and the Lone Mushroom has motives of its own. Use special abilities and in-game voice chat to separate friend from foe in this role-based social deduction game set in a beautiful world. Join public matchmaking solo or with a group; or invite your besties to private games -- the choice is yours! Teamwork with other players and use your abilities to find clues. Call meetings to discuss your findings and convince other players to vote out the killers! If all else fails, collect enough mystery orbs to open the escape portal and run for your life! Oracle can reveal the role of a nearby player. Protector can temporarily form a protective shield around a nearby player. Shaman can chat with or revive a dead player. Dartist can shoot a dart at a nearby player, killing them. Influencer can change the vote of another player during a meeting. Hunter can place a snare on the ground that ensnares players on enemy teams. Silencer can mute a player until the end of the next meeting. Normie has no special ability. Deceive other players and use your abilities to avoid suspicion. Act cool in meetings and try to pin the blame on someone else. Kill everyone before you're found out! Soothsayer can reveal the role of a nearby player. Creeper can temporarily become faster and invisible to other players. Trapper can place a trap on the ground that traps players on enemy teams. The Lone Mushroom is on a team by themselves! The Lone Mushroom's win condition depends on their role. Right now, there is one Lone Mushroom role (Trickster) and more are coming soon! Trickster wins the game if they are voted out! In-game proximity voice chat. Easy and fast online lobby system. Public matchmaking and private play. Customizable skin, expression, and gesture.",
