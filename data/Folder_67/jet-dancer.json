    "About the game": "You are Jenna Delgado, also known as Jet Dancer. A nanomachine-infused synthetic being bred as part of a project to develop humanoid weapons, Jenna Delgado was the last in her series. When she learned the true scope of her reason for being--to be used as both bodyguard and concubine to the highest bidder--she managed to escape the project and vowed to use her superhuman abilities to protect the innocent, as the super heroine Jet Dancer. But the evil head of the project, Serin Drakonis, has found her, and, determined to take her back under his control, has unleashed his machine army--and Jenna's predecessors--to bring her to heel. Jet Dancer must now fight to protect her own quality of life, and put an end to the project once and for all. -- JET DANCER is a retro-inspired action platforming game with beat-em-up elements, featuring a strong and sexy heroine inspired by games and comics of the 80s and 90s. With an easy-to-learn, hard-to-master arsenal of kicks and dashes, Jet Dancer is a weapon bred for war, but living for fun. The player proceeds through a variety of levels, using kicking attacks (and one uppercut), powerups and high-speed dashes to traverse obstacle courses and destroy a multitude of enemies, from gun-toting snipers and wall-mounted turrets, to lumbering bulwarks with impenetrable shields and walking bipedal tanks. It has all the classic features: score, lives and continues. Play well, get high scores, and find the bonus coins throughout the levels to improve your chances at victory. Jet Dancer’s boots are the basis of her might. With them, she launches explosive kicks, can easily soar through the air with rocket-powered leaps and cover great distances both horizontal and vertical even though she can’t actually fly. Kick combos are great, but Dash Kicking or Stomping, and using the explosive force to Rebound from targets, ascending to greater heights of damage and performance… That’s even better. And the tight, responsive controls make moving Jenna through the air, from foe to foe and out of the way of danger a joy. While the game only has one difficulty level (at first), the player has some control over how difficult or easy the game can be. Powerups are more frequent when the player takes damage. Losing all your lives takes you to the Game Over Shop, where coins can be spent on temporary boosts to Jet’s health, attack power and energy gain, and even extra lives, that can make a dramatic difference in the level of challenge. Be careful though, as every purchase increases the costs of others… use the boosts if you need to, but as ever, the best strategy is to get good! The story is told via text and hand-drawn cutscenes (that the player is free to skip). A reasonably skilled player should be able to reach the end of the game in less than three hours. But it will be a fun journey! Skilled players and completionists can also have fun filling out the list of (in-game) Achievements (Accolades) too!",
