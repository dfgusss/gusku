The power of Destruction and Healing await the chosen one. Create alliances with magical creatures and Gods. Many mysterious and mystical creatures reside in the forest. Gain their favor for additional strategic advantage. With enough favor you can sway the Gods to dominate your enemy. Keepers of the Forest is an epic, 2 player deck building game. Can be played alone against the computer or two local players can battle it out. Choose your hero to begin. Each of the 4 choices offers a different special ability (listed on each card) such as never having to discard or piercing through your opponent's protection with every damage dealt. Each player starts with the same 10 starter cards. Use the coins you draw into your hand to acquire new cards from the Keepers Row. Each card may give you health, damage, protection, more coins, or a combination of these. There are also many Keepers you can acquire that will allow you to do special things (written on each card). Some special rules include refreshing the keepers row - discarding up to all 5 of the drawn keepers and drawing new ones from the deck into the keepers row, combining cards in your discard pile, or immediately gaining spells into your discard pile. Cards may also require you to discard, or may allow you to draw an extra card, or even make your opponent discard a card (these are denoted as icons on the bottom of each card). The first player to bring their opponent to their knees, down to 0 health, wins!",
