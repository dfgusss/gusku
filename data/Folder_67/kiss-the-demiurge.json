    "About the game": "Kiss the Demiurge is a dramatic yuri visual novel about magic, delusions, regret, and love. 'For the purification of humanity!' Kiss the Demiurge follows the story of a girl named Minori, a mage who absolutely hates magic. As a child, she wished to become a magical girl like the heroes she saw on TV. One day, a mysterious voice offered to grant her magic powers and make her dreams come true. The young Minori eagerly accepted the stranger's gift, and was absolutely delighted as magic powers were bestowed upon her. But unfortunately, she soon came to realise that the gift of magic was actually a curse, a force of nature far beyond her control. Minori's magic misfired and both of her parents disappeared from this world because of it. She grew up wracked with guilt and declared that she would atone for her sins by ridding the world of all those who would seek magic. Minori investigates a fire at a local high school that she suspects to have been caused by magic.

She would like for nothing more than the world to leave her alone with her books. Whether it's tarot cards, astrology, or a crystal ball, she'll use whatever she can to predict the future and avoid any unwanted surprises. The elegant and beautiful Tomoko claims to be a spirit medium who regularly speaks to the spirits of the dead. She's always eager to help people connect with the spirits of deceased friends and family. Perhaps a little bit too eager...",
