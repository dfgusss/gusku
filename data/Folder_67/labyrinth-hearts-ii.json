    "About the game": "Labyrinth Hearts II is a single-player 2.5 dungeon crawler. You are summoned from another world to embody a champion and descend into the Labyrinth, a living organism that is said to house God. Only a sacrifice of love will appease this deity to grant the world 100 years of peace. Will you travel alone, or will you and your companion face this evil together? LH II contains the option for a 18+ romance/adult mode where you go through the dungeon with a companion. After each dungeon you will stop to rest and have a visual novel style story telling throughout with still images for the scenes. Alternatively, you can turn off romance/adult mode to play a dungeon crawler where you descend to face the enemy to save the world. While there is only one romance option at this time, later updates will include additional characters to traverse the dungeon with. The game can be played in first person or 3rd person mode with the ability to change values of your camera, FOV, and render distance for a more personal playstyle. The game is written in second person perspective with emphasis on dialogue between dungeon levels. Your decisions at the end of the Labyrinth will affect how the ending plays out. You have a main hub where you travel back and forth to rest, upgrade, and recover. You will need to manage your resources like food and light to survive the Labyrinth. The game has custom menus for your inventory and camera control or a more classic snes style equipment system. It is a blend of classic dungeon crawling and gameplay like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Hack. You can expect an average gameplay length from 7-10 hours of gameplay for each mode. Controller support and key binding change is not officially supported yet.",
