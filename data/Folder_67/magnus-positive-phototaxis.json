    "About the game": "Since I began this journey strange things began to happen. My reality was no longer as it was before, I did not know if I am losing my mind and whether I am heading in the right direction. A child in its mother’s womb does not know what is awaiting it, it is suspended in water as if it was in an abyss. It has the impression that its world is shrinking while in reality it is growing itself. Up to that moment only deafened sounds and blurry images reach it. Birth is a time of oppression but a new space opens further. Magnus Positive Phototaxis is an atmospheric journey through a mysterious world of characters, traces and symbols. Unique graphic aesthetics of the game deepens a keen impression feeling of communing with mystical reality Magnus Positive Phototaxis is a combination of an adventure, exploratory and logical game. The task of the player is to solve the puzzles, using proper combinations of objects, finding them in the environment around him. The game has aesthetics of a hand drawing, individual comic-sketch style. The story is filled with a language of symbols which may direct the player into a deeper philosophical reflection. We strive for the told story to be open to the player’s individual interpretation, that is why the depicted world is ambiguous. The game presents a journey of the main character as he learns the truth about himself, in a mysterious world around him. The story told within the game has an ambition of touching such philosophical-theological aspects as a soul’s wandering or metanoia. The mood of the game can be roughly described as : coded biblical symbols, SCP atmosphere, journey inside one's own being, searching for arche. This is the next installment of the Magnus series (first one is Magnus Failure, second Magnus Imago)",
