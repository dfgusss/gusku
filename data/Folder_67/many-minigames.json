    "About the game": "Description Many Minigames is a collection of minigames inspired by Wario Ware. In each game you must quickly identify the controls and the goal in order to beat it before time runs out. Each game is relatively simple: bringing to mind old console games and Flash games. However, when played one after the other they become more than the sum of their parts and beating all minigames without losing a life is quite a challenge. Game Modes Currently there are two modes: high score mode and practice mode. High score mode is where you have three lives and play through all minigames in a random order. Each loss removes one life. Practice mode is where you choose one specific minigame to play. At the moment the game is completely single player with no networking features of any kind. Community Feedback As I'm adding minigames and game modes I want the community's help to steer things in the right direction. What do you think about the game? Which minigames are too hard? Which are too easy? Which are the most fun? Which are the least fun? I would very much appreciate hearing your feedback. You can reach me via email or Twitter or just comment on this Steam page and I will read and respond promptly.",
