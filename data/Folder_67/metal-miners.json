    "About the game": "Metal Miners is a chaotic, resource gathering, party game set in a cave full of rich resources. In this 2-4 player, split-screen, action-driven game inspired by cult classic Kirby Air Ride, players are tasked with crafting the glorious Golden Crown to please a greedy king! Different Game Modes Metal Miners currently features 2 game modes: Golden Crown mode and Score Based mode. Crown mode is Metal Miners' unique mode which tasks each player to collect all the resources required to craft the Golden Crown! Score Based mode is a traditional round-based game mode where players must gather as many resources as possible to win the game. Unique Abilities To get an edge against your friends, you may choose an ability at the start of each game. These abilities range from Invisibility to a Dodge. You can get the drop on your enemies by putting these abilities to good use. You could even escape death by vanishing and running away! If trickery is your specialty, perhaps lay a tripwire to explode your friends! Item Tiers Metal Miners features 4 different resource tiers! The tiers of items are as follows (least rare -&gt; rarest): Copper Iron Titanium Diamond To progress in the game, players will need to craft pickaxes in order to advance to the next tier. If a player wants a Diamond, simply craft the Titanium Pickaxe! Crafting System While in between rounds, players may spend their resources that they have gathered and refined to craft 14 different amazing items. Some items are able to be crafted multiple times, while others are a permanent upgrade. The players will have to choose which items benefit their game the most! Multiple Maps Explore and Fight in several unique maps made to create tension and chaos among friends! Each map features a unique look and feel. More maps will be coming soon! Customizability Change the length of the game and the length between crafting rounds! More customizability is to come!",
