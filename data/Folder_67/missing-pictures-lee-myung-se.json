    "About the game": "Father is gone could have been Lee Myung-se’s debut film, but slipped into a long hiatus instead. After thirty years busy directing unprecedented features in Korea like First Love or Nowhere to Hide, Lee Myung-Se finally brings the lost project back to life through virtual reality. Set against the backdrop of a family of three moving to the outskirts of Seoul in the 1960s - where the director himself grew up - Father Is Gone questions the place of the father in the traditional Korean culture. MISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films. Shot in volumetric capture, the filmmakers Abel Ferrara, Tsai Ming-Liang, Catherine Hardwicke, Lee Myung-Se and Naomi Kawase narrate to us some key points of the movie and why it was never made.
