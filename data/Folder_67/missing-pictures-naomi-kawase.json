    "About the game": "The most celebrated female filmmaker from Japan revisits a project that she envisioned after her 2015 film Sweet Bean. Oh Debu tells the story of Aya, an over romantic woman very complexed by her weight. Through this story, Naomi Kawase wanted to give herself a challenge trying to make a comedy, far from her naturalist, poetic previous work. MISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films. Shot in volumetric capture, the filmmakers Abel Ferrara, Tsai Ming-Liang, Catherine Hardwicke, Lee Myung-Se and Naomi Kawase narrate to us some key points of the movie and why it was never made.
