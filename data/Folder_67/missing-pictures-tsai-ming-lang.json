    "About the game": "Tsai Ming-Liang, the Taiwanese maestro of slow cinema, doesn’t have a real “missing picture”. But what he does have are childhood memories, so vivid that he told us why it is impossible for him to film it, in a moving tribute to his grandparents who took him to see two movies every night. MISSING PICTURES is a 5-part documentary series in VR that brings to life unmade films. Shot in volumetric capture, the filmmakers Abel Ferrara, Tsai Ming-Liang, Catherine Hardwicke, Lee Myung-Se and Naomi Kawase narrate to us some key points of the movie and why it was never made.
