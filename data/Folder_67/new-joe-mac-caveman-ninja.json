    "About the game": "Welcome to prehistorical jungle! We’re back in the distant Past, when “Rock &amp; Roll” was just about rocks and “Fast food”, a dinner that you couldn’t catch. 2 cave dudes named Joe &amp; Mac live in a peaceful and cool village. Cool it was, until a bogus bunch of Neanderthal snatched all the village’s women. It’s now up to Joe &amp; Mac to save them all, and fight against deadly dinosaurs and carnivorous plants in this crazy and colorful action-plateformer from Jurassic time, with completely redesigned graphics ! The HD version of this famous arcade game is still fun and quirky, but also longer, better, faster, stronger… FEATURES 🌴 MAKE YOUR WAY through this PRE-HYSTERICAL JUNGLE : Run, jump and fight through varied side-scrolling 2D stages in a true arcade game style 🌴 A BRAND NEW DESIGN : Experience a full and faithful remake of the arcade original game with new graphics, new sounds, and better control for an unprecedented experience 🌴 NEW MODES: 2 modes are on the menu, the arcade Mode (Remake) and an extended mode that will bring you a longer game experience. 🌴 CO-OP MODE : one pre-historical dude may be not enough, ask a friend to play with you to share a stronger adventure. 🌴 EACH MODE WILL HAVE NEW FEATURES: a training mode, a boss rush mode, a score attack mode and, to play faster than ever, a speedrun mode !",
