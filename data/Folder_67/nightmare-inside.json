    "About the game": "Hi and welcome. We are Mr. Trees. Welcome to Finn's life! We've been waiting in this forest for decades, but finally we found someone to tell. Now you're here, you can listen to Finn's story! Finn, a high school student, lives in a town with his mother and friends. (She makes very nice pies.) We remember him even as a child. He was a sweetheart! Unfortunately, he didn't see much of his father as a child. But, he has a lot of friends which are adorable. He hangs with them all day. We think their names were Guffie, Fluffy, Axy, Froggie, Foggie, Salsie. If we had to explain them: Guffie : The purple ghost. Fluffy : Cutest cat alive. Axy : The pink axolotl. Froggie : Frog laughing meme. Salsie : The shy tomato. Foggie : Tired from climate change. Furthermore, we are super excited to see you. Don't miss this adventure! We'll be waiting for you!",
