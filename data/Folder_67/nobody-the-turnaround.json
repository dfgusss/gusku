    "About the game": "There is only one heroism in the world: to see the world as it is, and to love it. — Romain Rolland Nobody - The Turnaround takes place in a parallel world similar to our current reality. The story unfolds in a modern metropolis, but not the concrete jungle as you know it. It's more about the undergrowth, the much less glamorous neighborhoods where actual life happens. “You” are one of the ordinary “Nobodies” in this world. You do not have a distinguished family background, elite education, or once-in-a-lifetime business opportunities. However, through hard work and determination, you might eventually get rid of your troubles and make your way in this realistic society. Discord: Game Features A Convincing Life Simulator With systematic reconstructions of your possible physical status, such as Health and Emotions, Nobody – The Turnaround aims to accurately represent a person's working and living situations. You may suffer injuries, get sick or feel down due to various unexpected random events in life. It's important for you to balance everything and strive. Work Hard and Strive for Success From the initial basic jobs to skilled labor that requires specific training, you can experience all kinds of professions here in Nobody – The Turnaround. You can start by bricklaying, distributing leaflets, or mail delivery. All you need to do is work hard, create your career path, and eventually secure your dream job. Real Life and Everyday Entertainment You can do some group dancing with the ladies on the basketball court, play Chinese chess with the older man at the street corner, play games in the internet café, or lose yourself in the bookstore. Besides hard work, you need to arrange your pastimes responsibly to improve your mood and adjust your conditions. Special Sandbox Mode After experiencing the difficult journey of the Story Mode, you can choose to play the Sandbox Mode. Use your decision-making and management abilities to plan your career freely without all the restraints. Social System &amp; Relationships Interact with dozens of characters, and as their affinity level increases, their hidden stories will be revealed. It’s even possible for you to romance some of them and build a life together.",
