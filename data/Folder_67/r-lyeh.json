    "About the game": "R'lyeh is a story-driven, open-world, Lovecraftian Horror and Survival game with a scifi twist. It follows the story of Elias Frost, a lone survivor who crash-lands on a mysterious planet. Earth has been decimated by monstrous beings and the last of humanity scurried to send ships into space. They were hoping to find a new world to colonize and re-establish mankind. After a devastating incident, Elias is left alone on R’lyeh with a precious cargo; cryogenically frozen human embryos. He must fight to build a home in which they can be born and not just survive, but thrive. There is much more to R’lyeh’s overcast islands, however. Something dreadful that Elias must come to understand if he wishes for any chance to live. Crafting R'lyeh features an entirely unique, custom crafting system that encourages an immersive atmosphere. Instead of a painful grindfest for resources, the challenge comes in working with the real-world physics of objects. How you place things, where you place things, and what things you combine together will offer you new recipes and unlock many blueprints. Just because something may only require four logs, doesn't mean you won't have to figure out how to get those logs onto your work surface. Combat R'lyeh is not your typical shooter/slicer/murder-hobo game. While some things can be killed, others cannot, or will require intelligent processes to do so. In R'lyeh, you'll be introduced to an arsenal of traps, cages, blockades, determents and other tricks to showcase your intellectual prowess as the only human on this world. You must overcome your enemies with your mind, not bullets. Story The greatest element of R'lyeh is its story. The pace is set by the player as they traverse this dangerous world and its many environments. Along the way, they unlock clues, strange ruins, and the story of a very special creature. As you progress, you will learn of this world and your future in it. Art And Design Nearly all objects in the world have been custom modeled and textured. Rather than an asset flip, R'lyeh's world items are suited to the alien environment of the world.",
