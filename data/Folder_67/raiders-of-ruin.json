    "About the game": "In Raiders of Ruin, you guide a group of 5 champions sent on a quest to seize the throne of the Underworld itself. Along the way, you will encounter many deadly bosses and engage in challenging, strategic turn-based combat. You decide how to build your party, mixing-and-matching between 9 different classes, each with drastically different strengths and weaknesses. You can change classes any time, so experiment frequently to craft the perfect strategy for each enemy! Features Over 40 boss fights, each with their own unique mechanics. Expect multiple phases, colourful gimmicks, and ruthless attacks. No game-overs: Your progress is saved after every battle. Defeat simply means a chance to try again. Study your enemies ahead of time by viewing the Boss Log, where you can find a record of your greatest foes and a description of their attacks. You must prepare to counter their strategies with a plan of your own! Class-based combat system that's simple to learn, hard to master. Swap classes before any battle to arm yourself for the fight ahead. Find a combo that works for you and stick to it, or experiment frequently to find the perfect squad. 9 main classes to choose from. Need more firepower? Swap that Paladin for a Wizard. Expecting a long fight? Try poisoning your foe with a Rogue. Multiple subclasses for most classes, providing even more customization. Should your Ranger be a Hunter, or a Survivalist? Innovative rematch system that replaces traditional level-grinding. Instead of fighting normal enemies repeatedly, you will occasionally be given the opportunity to rematch a boss of your choosing for a second chance at its rewards (though this system is entirely optional). MIDI soundtrack inspired by PC games of the early 2000's, with some modern twists. A backpack that might be alive? ------------------------------------------------- 'I won't waste my time trying to plead with you. We all know how this has to end. So... Are you ready for battle?'",
