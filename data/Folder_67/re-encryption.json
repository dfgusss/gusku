    "About the game": "RE Encryption is a game about about being a old science bot trying to figure out what has happened to humanity. No signs of live where found, even though you remember them. You trying are trying to get a signal to outer space to see if you are the last half-sentiant being left. RE Encryption is a game which follows a narrative while also giving normal gaming challenges like timing, strategy, and general skill. A game of decent graphics, and hard challenges. Explore, a space station, then frantically fire at turrets.",
