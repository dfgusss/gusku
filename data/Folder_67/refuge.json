    "About the game": "At first, no one cared about the pandemic until a corpse slowly stood up 'The last refuge' is about the 13th year after the pandemic. The city has fallen, and the world has entered a state of disorder. Less than 1% of human survivors have wandered everywhere and built shelters one by one. The survivors' alliance is a confederacy organization formed by them, which aims to eliminate zombies and rebuild their homes. The protagonist was born in camp 7182. The conditions here are quite good. Uninfected rabbits can even be seen in the wild. But whether you can survive the attack of wave after wave of corpse tide, and then enter the alliance to attack cities and territories together and rebuild the world order depends on your ability. Other places in the world are scattered with other people's camps, which can be transmitted there through crystals. Whether it is an enemy or a friend, aggression or alliance depends on your diplomatic skills. Of course, in this end of the world, perhaps only strength and interests are the final determinants. To block the more and more turbulent tide of corpses, you can't rely on yourself. The key to success is to develop camp technology, quickly manufacture and upgrade high-end equipment such as automatic artillery, UAV, laser fence, etc. don't forget that before the fusion battery is developed, there must be sufficient solar panels to supply power, otherwise, these equipment will be just a pile of junk. The remaining zombies of human consciousness are very difficult to exist. Sometimes they attack human beings and sometimes help human beings. Therefore, the alliance often quarrels about how to treat them. The most important thing is that there are a lot of them, about 400million.",
