    "About the game": "Break It Till You Make It! - Destruction 'Puzzle' Platformer Rubble is a destruction-focused physics platformer where you will run and jump through gravity zones, break down or tunnel through destructibles, slide over ice, fling yourself with catapults, carry things by hand or conveyor, and use rebuild ing shots to respawn destructible terrain! Elements of: Portal + Minecraft + ...Getting Over it? Rubble is set in a silly dystopian future game show (think MXC / Takeshi's Castle, etc.) where contestants are pitted against dangerous obstacle courses in a simulated physics environment. To survive, they must use the power of friendship (or respawning) and this gun they found. With each spectacular death, the announcer will read a one-line intro for the next expendable contestant to give it a try! Speedrun / Replayability Encouraged! Every level tracks your time (but never compares it on a leaderboard, you can post it on Reddit if you're into that )! The main menu keeps a tally of ALL your best times for every level! If you make a mistake, use the quick restart hotkeys and be back in in seconds! Player-determined Difficulty with Assist Mode and Level Skipping Frustration sucks, so Rubble offers the ability to tweak the gravity, speed, air control, and number of air-jumps to make things more approachable (or quadruple jump past the puzzle!) And if you really get stuck, after a short time you can skip any level and move on to the next (you can come back later in the level select if you want!) Features 50 levels with new mechanics every few levels! Assist mode settings like slowing time, lowering gravity, and adding additional jumps! Speedrun Friendly and replayable with quick restart and 'return to checkpoint' hotkeys! Cool animal facts on the loading screens! Voice over narration for commiserating losses and introducing new contestants! ( Note: This is an indie game created by a solo dev over several years. To quote John Mulaney: 'I am very small. And have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.' )",
