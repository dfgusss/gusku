    "About the game": "You'll need to complete a fairly simple ritual, but first you'll need to find the instruction notes and hidden clues found throughout the house. To do this, you need to use an ultraviolet flashlight and a camera. You will interfere with the demon and his minions. It is better not to make noise in the house, because you are not alone there, and if you hear a raven, stop running away will not help you. Game Features: Demon - May appear in a circle when using the microphone. Henchman Toy - always knows where you are, afraid of ultraviolet light. Raven's henchman is blind, but hears well. It is unrealistic to run away from him, it is better to wait until he disappears. The Cross and the Bible - The cross and the bible are pretty good weapons. Someone is afraid of the cross, someone of the bible, it is enough to have it with you, it’s a pity they will help only once ... Soul sealing ritual - you need to find an apple, blood, feather, wooddu and place them in bowls in the basement, but each item must be placed in its own bowl. Apply the correct circle of the demon with a can of paint. And place the crystal sphere in a large bowl. Camera - will show hidden things, but the number of photos is limited",
