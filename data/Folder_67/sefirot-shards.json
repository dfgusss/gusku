    "About the game": "Hello to all gamers! “Sefirot Shards” is a collectible card RPG in the fantasy genre. We have the undead, all sorts of knights and witches – just as you like it. So rack up the cards into your deck and go show everyone who’s the boss out there! But also check out the quest dialogues, they are quite amusing and peculiar! And the artist did one hell of a job as well – check how beautiful everything is! We hope that you will greatly enjoy your time in our game and won't judge it too harshly, since every member of the team, from the chief director to the narrative designer’s grandmother – already did that for you. They really-really did. We strived to make the combat in the game interesting and moderately complex. The perfect phrase to describe it would be “hard to learn, hard to master”. Hold up, are you supposed to say “easy to learn, hard to master”? Whoopsie, a little mistake over here. In the game you will always have something to do: explore the locations, collect the cards and beat up the filth. You will get around quickly thanks to an intuitive interface that is familiar to all connoisseurs of the genre, but also easy for the new players to understand. Basically, try not to break your monitor. Or better buy a bulletproof one right away. You will get to know the story… of yourself, where tragedy and humor, idle talk and philosophy, senselessness and ruthlessness – will intertwine as one. And most importantly, as in the finest traditions of the RPG genre – your choice won’t matter in the slightest! So enough text – go and uncover all the mysteries of Sefirot!",
