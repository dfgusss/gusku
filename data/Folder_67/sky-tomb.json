    "About the game": "SKY TOMB is an action-packed 2.5D Shoot 'em Up Reverse Bullet Hell Roguelike with retro influences. This game utilizes a 3D perspective with 2D visuals, wherein you and your ship are posed against immense hordes of bloodthirsty enemies. You are tasked with surviving as long as you can until your ship is destroyed and you start over, unlocking new ships in the process. That's because it probably is, but this one is also fast, fun and dirt cheap. Traditional Space Combat Inspired by retro classics like Galaga and Asteroids, you steer your ship in zero-G - using your momentum and ship abilities to outmanoeuvre your opponents, equipped with a massive arsenal of missiles, plasma blasters, and many more weapons and modules. Buildcraft As you destroy enemies, you choose weapons and modules from a pool of randomly selected upgrades - turning your ship from a rustbucket with wings into a cacophony of destruction. No run is ever the same as you are encouraged to experiment heavily with a myriad possible upgrade options and build paths, as everything scales with everything . Lateral Progression As you progress, you will unlock more ships with completely different weaponry - shaking up your runs with build possibilities that fit your style of play. Upcoming Features More Stages More Enemies More Ships More Upgrades More Unlocks Bosses And maybe more! Take part in the development by giving us feedback!",
