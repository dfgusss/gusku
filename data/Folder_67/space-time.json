    "About the game": "Hello and welcome to Space Time! Your goal is to shoot and destroy space rocks to raise your score. The real enemy is the clock...that's right time itself is against you. There are 3 game modes Mission Critical requires 1000 points more each level, Double Down which requires double the score of the last level and Defiance which pits your score against an enemy score in a tug of war style endurance match. Unlock all 9 (including 2 secret) ships each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Enjoy beautiful backgrounds and an amazing sound track as you blast your targets away. Space Time was designed so that it can be played one-handed with either hand for those who suffer from an injury or disability which prevents the use of both hands. Thank you again for your interest in my game, this is my first and I hope to make many many more.",
