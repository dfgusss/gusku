    "About the game": "!!The game is early in development, I recommend you do not buy it yet!! What is this game about? In Speluncaphobia ['morbid fear of caves'], you play through different stories of cavers who went missing in the abyss. Currently, there is only one story included, 'The Akanitira Cave', but more will get added soon. Story 1 - The Akanitira Cave There is a small cave called Akanitira near your hometown. It was a massive tourist attraction, up to the point where the money gathered from the tourism fed your whole town. Until one day people started missing after going to the cave. One by one, dozens of them disappeared. You decided to take matters into your own hands and ventured into the cave yourself. After a few hours of searching, you found a small squeeze in the cave that hadn't been discovered before. You went in and... The rest is up to you. Find out what happened to those people.",
