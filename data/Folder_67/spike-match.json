    "About the game": "Spike Match is a multiplayer game inspired by the game of soccer with nails. Be careful with your play, and use the pins to your advantage, if you make a mistake you can give your opponent a chance to score. The focus of the game is the multiplayer experience. Know how to control your aim and also the speed of the ball or you will miss an opportunity to score. This version of the game will have some maps that will each contain their own characteristics. This will require the player to train more on each map and its singularities. The player who dominates the map will have an advantage over the opponent. In the launch version the game will have only one map, the others will be added in the future. New gameplay modes are also being developed.",
