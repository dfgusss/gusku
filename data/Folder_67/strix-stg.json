    "About the game": "'Strix STG' is a 'Communication-Synchronized Bullet-Hell Casual Vertical-Scrolling Shooting-Game'. Let's aim to capture all 5 stages while destroying enemies. You can also choose from 5 levels of difficulty. * Up to stage 2 has been implemented at the start of early access. * There is a possibility that the contents of the stage will be changed until the final version is released. The best feature of this game is the ability to play two-player co-op online. Simple chat with two types of fixed phrases is available, so please use it for role sharing. * Currently, there is no save function for play data, so it is not possible to record the score. I may add a save function in the future based on user feedback.
