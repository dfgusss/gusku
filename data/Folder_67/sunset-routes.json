    "About the game": "'Sunset Route' is a mini-game that simulates sailing management in a concise and abstract way. First of all, you need to choose the target location. The location determines what kind of character you will get and the probability of getting the role. Then you need to choose a character, which appears randomly due to various factors, including the target location itself, and characters that help you get rare characters, etc. The character determines how much cargo the ship can carry. There are various linkages between characters, and you need to configure your characters in the best way, or somehow kick characters out of your ship so that the ship can carry more cargo. The total amount of cargo that can be shipped, the type of cargo on board, and the next location choice determine how much gold you'll get. Of course, the next location also determines the cargo that is loaded on your ship. There will be a money test every 5 rounds. How to quickly and clearly achieve the combination you want determines how far you can go. The main fun of the game is to choose the crew and form the build, and pass the numerical test through the build. If you have played 'Luck be a Landlord', you should have a similar experience. Of course, the game also has multiple endings and achievements. Some choices during the voyage will affect the final outcome, but the plot is not rich. Finally, I hope you like this mini-game.",
