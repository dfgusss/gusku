    "About the game": "SURREALIDADE - DEFINITIVE EDITION Welcome to your mind! In the 20s, artists led by André Breton got together to create a new form of art, an art that used the expressions of the unconscious through the Psychic Automatism. To this end, they developed the Surrealist Techniques, which are nothing more than ways to bring out this dark side of the human mind. Today, you will follow in their footsteps, bravely exploring a strange and bizarre world, bringing to light the imagery and genius of the Surrealist movement. Be taken on a journey through Surrealist Techniques, and if you are chosen, you will reach your ultimate goal: The Macrocosm! Witness an inner universe and actively participate in this unusual saga, which may lead you in other directions. But do not think that this will be an easy task! You will experience an immersion in a virtual environment where you will have to interact freely with the objects and beings that live there. Your mission in search of the Supra-Reality will be arduous, you will have to follow the path that the Artists and Philosophers of the Surrealist Universe have trodden. Beware, you may arrive in places that are not so welcoming. It is up to you to discover the secrets of this exotic environment, and to do so you will have the help of the strange beings who may be willing to help you. There will be moments when your skills will be put to use, reasoning, intelligence, inspiration, agility, and a good sense of exploration are some of the ingredients that you must not fail to bring to venture into Surreality. Culture, Art, Entertainment, and Knowledge combine to form an authentic Surrealist experience in an inhospitable and unknown world called the Unconscious. WHAT IS SURREALITY Surreality is an obscure, totally independent Brazilian game created in 1999 by a small team of surrealism-obsessed people. Over the years it has become cult among its admirers. The version you are going to play now is the definitive edition, with a series of improvements and extra material for you to better enjoy everything Surreality has to offer, but the story, graphics, music and gameplay remain intact, exactly the same as it was created in 1999. We are very proud of this project that, although dated in many ways, maintains its charm and innovation to this day. It contains some elements that in today's eyes may sound offensive to some people, even though they were not created with this intention and do not represent the opinions of the team. In the name of historical preservation we have decided to keep these elements unchanged. What you are about to play is a love letter to surrealism and gaming. Enjoy, and open the doors of your unconscious. Dimitri Kozma GAME FEATURES Three levels of play!
