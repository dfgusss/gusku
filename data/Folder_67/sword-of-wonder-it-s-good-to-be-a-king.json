    "About the game": "If you enjoy sandbox style adventure in Arthurian times, then this is the project you've been waiting for. Cast ashore in a distant unknown land, Jack (name customizable) arrives next to a lake, where a mysterious woman float into view, offers him a chance to rule, and more...if only he'd pull the sword. After a brief trip to the nearby city of Camelot, you learn the roads are not safe in the kingdom, and the rulers are in a rocky position, at best. A Princess catches your eye and invites you back to her place, where you have the opportunity to not just romance one woman, but basically all of them. Guide yourself through this fantasy tale and keep that sword up and ready. You will need to mount every challenge thrown your way, and prove you are worthy of victory. Features: - Thousands of renders in Full HD - 41 Animated erotic scenes accessible via in-game Replay feature - Sandbox style mechanics - Thousands of lines of dialogue, over 125,000 words of rich, fantasy story filled with humor, drama, love, and sex. - Multiple story paths - Explicit animated sex scenes (NSFW) - Optional mini-games where you have to hunt down a chicken with a knife, or win a short in-game card game to unlock specific events - Many hours of playtime - A dozen plus characters and relationship outcomes - Music and ambient sounds, hear the leaves rustle in the trees, the birds sing, or the lake lap at the shore. - Mouse or keyboard control",
