    "About the game": "Ivan is a young boy who has shut himself off from everything and everyone. A tragic event has deeply upset him altering his behavior. Ivan’s mother decides to ask a psychologist, Dr Alexander, for help. In order to keep in touch with his suffering. Dr Alexander suggests they create a story session by session; this will make it possible for Ivan to explore his real problems without talking directly about them, since his suffering is still too intense for him to face it explicitly. In this story the main character, Vain, represents Ivan’s alter-ego. So the game has two different narrative streams: on one hand, in the Dr Alexander’s office, the boy-psychologist dialogues unfold; on the other hand you can follow Ivan’s storytelling as it develops and flows with the help of Dr Alexander, which indeed is the player’s key to explore Ivan’s amazing inner world, acting as Vain. The gameplay is set inside Ivan’s and his psychologist’s story, where the world is a figment of Ivan’s imagination – a fantasy world of mystery where Vain will head out on an adventurous journey full of danger and symbolic references! In the story narrated by Ivan, you will find yourself in the shoes of Vain, a young explorer who lost his memory and ended up in an unknown world. You’ll play a classic 2D rpg game with a turn-based combat system. In this game there are challenging riddles – in other words, puzzles to be solved in the explorable areas. The player will solve them in order to activate switches or to reach some platforms. The game features an original soundtrack composed by Italian musician Manuel Magrini. In this game, the soundtrack plays a key role in creating the right atmosphere and expressing Ivan’s feelings in every single moment of his adventure.",
