    "About the game": "Temple Trashers is a couch co-op tower defense game, in which the towers you build can hurt you and your friends just as much as they can hurt your enemies. Build towers, aim them towards your foes and collect the crystals that drop in order to build more turrets and survive the endless hordes of enemies! You can play both: alone or with friends, with keyboard or controller, but we do recommend friends and controllers :) The only limit to the amount of players able to play at the same time is the amount of controllers and/or friends you have! The game is developed by a group of volunteer students from the Hackerspace NTNU student organization over the span of 2 years. The game is open-source and 100% free! Want to contribute, give feedback, report a bug or even just peek at our code? Head over to the official github page! For other projects and information, take a look at Hackerspace's website.",
