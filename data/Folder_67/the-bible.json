    "About the game": "The Bible is a digital recreation of the original work, in the form of a kinetic novel. Each book and story can be read in any order, and any passage can be saved and revisited later for study. This digital recreation includes an original soundtrack; and a wonderful audiobook presentation from beginning to end. A Trivia section has been added to test the knowledge of any who think they truly know the Scriptures. If you find yourself getting more wrong than you'd expect dive further into the text and find the answers for yourself! Put your Computer to use by opening The Bible and leaving the audio running while it's minimized. Absorb it all while you work, study, or relax. It's here to be enjoyed and studied as a seamless and unobtrusive experience.",
