    "About the game": "FEATURES Colorful, unique drinks -- the more you progress, the more recipes you will learn. After each round, spin for a random mod or event that will always keep the game unique and challenging. Avoid permadeath! If you fail to pay your rent, you will lose the run and have to start over! Save your progress and track your run history. As you play through and earn more run victories, you will unlock new unique mods that will be added to your pool. SUMMARY Work your way through rounds by serving customers to earn gold. You must earn enough each round to pay your rent -- or else you're done for! Save your extra gold to purchase new recipes and level up. Reach the ultimate rank before you miss rent... or die :D Every round will be affected by a random game mod. Tons of unique mods keep every round interesting! Some are good, some are bad, and some are just plain weird.",
