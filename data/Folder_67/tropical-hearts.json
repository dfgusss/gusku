If you’re up for a fling before you seal the deal with your partner of choice, there’s several sexy strangers waiting for you across Paradise Island. Defend your tropical paradise side by side with your friends!

Collect precious materials to upgrade your weapons, craft new items to aid you in your quest, and try out various experimental cocktails lovingly prepared by Marc, the veteran bartender at the Hotel Bar! A strangely familiar voice calls to you in your dreams as you delve deeper and deeper into the mystery behind the otherworldly attackers. Why are these creatures here, and what do they want? It's up to you to find out!",
