    "About the game": "They say that the trick to flying is to throw yourself on the ground and miss. Well, now you can find out if it’s true! And you don’t even have to risk your own life thanks to our simple and easy to navigate simulation game. Take on the role of one of nine fearless characters and throw yourself into the unknown, aiming for your target destination. The closer you get, the more coins you gain! 💰 Use coins to upgrade your character to make the game even more entertaining. Pass next levels to reach new incredible locations - you can jump off of skyscrapers, trains, bridges and volcanos. You can even jump into outer space!🪐🌋🚀🌉 The higher the level, the more difficult the game gets, but fear not! You can upgrade your power and flying skills to jump even further and beat your records! And remember, People Can Fly, and let no one tell you otherwise! I mean in our game… and for a moment… until you eventually fall. But when you do, just try to hit the finish target. Anyway, have fun, and stay safe!",
