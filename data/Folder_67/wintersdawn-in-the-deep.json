    "About the game": "Wintersdawn in the Deep is an easygoing, snackable adventure game based on the acclaimed all-ages fantasy webcomic Beyond the Western Deep . For the people of Sunsgrove, the annual Wintersdawn festival is a time to come together and celebrate their past accomplishments. For Quinlan, a newly-minted scout of the kingdom, it's his one chance to partake in food and fun, and to forget the past year's trials. Unfortunately for Quinlan, events conspire to send him into the wilds of the Western Deep: an untamed forest filled with the kingdom's deadliest creatures. Before he can return home, Quinlan must successfully complete his very first solo patrol, uncover the fate of a lost merchant, and survive the dangers hiding within the Western Deep. Needless to say, this year's Wintersdawn festival will be anything but ordinary. Features - A self-contained 'adventure short story' inspired by the dark fantasy worlds of 80's animation and the vibrant pixel art of late-80's EGA PC adventures! - Simple point-and-click interface with a drag-and-drop inventory system. - An original, fully orchestral soundtrack. - An unlockable collection of over 20 pieces of bonus and concept artwork chronicling the history of Beyond the Western Deep .",
