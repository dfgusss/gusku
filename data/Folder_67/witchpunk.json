    "About the game": "Do you like Halloween? Do you like skeletons, pumpkins, and witches on skateboards? And most importantly, do you like bashing robots with giant, magic hammers? If you do, then get out your magic wands and your spraypaint, because we know a game that you'll love! Witchpunk is a third-person melee arena combat game where you play as Mollie, a skateboarding witch who battles against a tyrannical corporation seeking to destroy Halloween. Skate around the city and the subway, gaining speed in order to deal devastating blows to robots of all shapes and sizes. Skate faster to slam harder, and use your spells to leave enemies stunned and reeling! Backed with a signature funky beat and comic-inspired visuals, you'll have a blast as you take down wave after wave of these no-good robots. Once you've made your mark on the city, you might even get a chance to show a supremely evil businesswoman what you think about her lousy plans! Features High-speed hammer-bashing skateboard combat. An array of Halloween-themed robots to demolish. Bright, comic-like visuals. Spooky, funky beats!
