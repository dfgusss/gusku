You have powerful ultimates that can be used to wipe out hordes of zombies and there are various power-ups around the map to give you an edge. Zombies get faster and more powerful as rounds increase and harder enemies will spawn as you progress. How many rounds can you survive? What's included in its current state: - Zombie Town map with 5 areas to explore. - Player progression to include an exp system, perk cards and more. - Full controller support. - Character customization. - Multiple attacks to include base attacks, ultimates, and traps. - 3 zombie types. - Power-ups and stat points to assign in game to make your character stronger. Discord: Note: This is a first release from Lazy Goose Games and is meant to be a fun game that you can play casually in between other games. This isn't a huge story driven open world type game by any means but more meant as a fun break. Thanks for checking it out!",
