    "About the game": "One thousand years beyond the fall of Earth What is old, is new. What is life, grants death. What is lost, may be found... Behold the Megalith: A city carved from the slag of worlds, heaving beneath its own weight and decrepitude, home to the many sins and rare virtues of humanity. Among them, a street urchin pockets the secrets of a dead man, a team of salvagers hunts a treasure from across the ages, and a young woman seeks to combat and contain the outbreak of a deadly disease, while politics and organised crime collide around her. In time, their paths shall converge, and lead them out into the fire; across the seething waves of the Burning Sea, past pirate and storm, and far away to the Rim, to the edge of all charts... and beyond. A six hundred page tale of nautical adventure, friendship, villainy, mystery and grim certainty. Please Note: This product is a digital book, packaged and presented via a game engine. Its interactive elements are limited to book and menu navigation. Includes .epub and .pdf versions! Sample the first hundred pages in the demo, along with samples of other upcoming works!",
