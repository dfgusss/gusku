    "About the game": "Originally released in 1996, Actua Golf brought the Actua Sports series staples of fully 3d environments, multiple cameras, motion captured player movements, and world-class commentary to the golf course. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Compete in practice, stroke play, match play, skins, foursome, four ball challenge, amateur tour, and pro tour modes. Features two challenging 18-hole courses to test your golfing skills. Customize your golfer, and lead them to greatness. Commentary provided by Peter Alliss (the 'Voice of Golf'), Pat O'Brian and Tony Adamson. Play with up to 4 players. By default, the game operates round-robin style, with a single controller being handed around for each player's turn. To play instead with a single controller for each player, first set the desired number of players on the main menu, then go to Controls &gt; Controller and assign a different controller to each player. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
