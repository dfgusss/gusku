As the game goes on, her memory will be gradually awakened and the truth of the world will emerge. - This is a single player adventure game, requiring players to jump, fight, and a little decryption. - The game process of this work has a certain degree of freedom, mainly in the following two aspects: *The game maps are connected, and players can select the attack sequence of the map area to a certain extent. *Players can pass through the game in the initial state, or win gold coins by defeating the enemy, and then go to the store to buy powerful weapons, energy stones and other ways to improve themselves, and then challenge the boss. Players can decide according to their own preferences. - The game has challenging levels and Boss battles. - Players can carry 3 kinds of weapons at the same time. The attack means of each weapon are completely different, and they can switch instantaneously, so that players can achieve their unique fighting style and freely combine their fighting skills. - There is almost no mandatory plot animation in the game.
