Loot, blow up your enemies and most of all: Run! Features: - 13 diffrent spell that randomly upgrades from level to level, because there was no more idea for a 14th spell. - 40 different level, because we couldn’t just stop at 39. - 4 boss battles, ergo not 3. - Exploding crowd, because why not! The following picture shows what features are we planning for the near future: Have fun! - Sandor &amp; Norbiúr",
