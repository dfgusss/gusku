    "About the game": "Set in a distant future, a dystopian society struggles with crime and prostitution. In a dark alley, a sign on the door reads: 'Bebop, private investigator'. But is he a private investigator really? I DON'T THINK SO. Bebop is involved with the mob, and he is about to embark on a journey without return. I mean, he will return home, but NOT THE SAME as before. Bebop will meet people that will shape his personality, he will go after those who wronged him, and he will, in the end, reach the end of his story. OR IS HE? This amazing adventure was written by Luis Felipe Pimenta, in his first attempt at creating a game. Hopefully, it won't be his last. His team is made of programmers doing artwork and artists doing programming. Bebop is a platform side-scroller pixel art adventure. Use physics to solve puzzles, travel through different places in Cybercity to complete your quests. Features: - 2D Physics puzzles - Choices that matter and affect your ending - Tough ethical decisions to make - Tightly crafted platforming action and deeply emotional storytelling - Exploring options: to find hidden levels, equipment and more storytelling - Use drugs to jump higher - Well-designed maps: with traps and cyberpunk ambiences - Challenging bosses",
