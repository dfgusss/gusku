    "About the game": "Blood Bay: Card History – This is a fairy tale ballad in the genre of card games. In ancient times, when dragons burned villages, and pirates - ships ... When unconquered magic wandered the earth and the life of every person hung by a thread ... There was at that time a kingdom called the Archipelago, because it stood on a handful of islands in the Shark Sea . Difficult times overtook the kingdom after the death of the king: wars, famines, illnesses... The young, excited prince decided to put an end to this and went to the northern lands shrouded in mystery in search of treasures. And he happened to meet a demon there and he concluded a contract with him. Now the life of the kingdom depended only on him... Walk the path of the prince by choosing options for action! Peculiarities: You have to make a wise (and sometimes not very) choice that will determine the fate of the kingdom! Colorful 2D graphics, hundreds of different cards! Card narration of the plot and story!",
