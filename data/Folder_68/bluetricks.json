    "About the game": "STORY Circles and squares coexist in the world. Meanwhile, a square saw a company's circle cut off the square angle. However, the square disappears before you know it. At the same time, six people who chose to give up their individuality and make money safely go to job interview in a small company. While waiting for an interview, they hear a scream. The scream originated from the back of the interview room, where circles were cutting the square's angle (individuality). The circles were trying to cut off the square who was new to the company and still had some individuality left. The main character unconsciously wraps his angle with his hands and realizes the importance of his individuality. Angry, the square picks up the gun next to him and threatens the circle. When he picks it up, the color of the weapon changed to suit his personality. So the square made a decision. To defend and strengthen one's personality against bad people. FEATURES 1. Quotes - When you level up, a famous saying is displayed, making player think about their life. 2. Moving floors - Eating arrow items increases the player's chances of survival by moving the floor in the direction of the arrow! 3. Gimmicks - There are a total of six maps, and there are three stages for each map. There are a total of 18 stages and each map has its own gimmick system. WHY WE CREATED THIS GAME Since we know the current situation and similar situations of our acquaintances, we thought that we would be able to deliver our message well if we produced the game based on these contents. In addition, we produced it to make people in their 20s and 40s and 50s who play games feel the emotions of going back to the past once again. But regardless of age, we constantly ask ourselves questions. 'Is this the right way?' 'Maybe this is not the right way.' 'Should I give up and make money instead?' 'Bluetrix' was produced in the sense that we should not give up our dreams and try until the end for those who are agonizing at the crossroads of choice. 'You are an unprocessed gemstone. If you don't give up, you become a jewel and you can achieve anything.'",
