    "About the game": "'CodingPack' is a puzzle game about moving package to the right position, and you can do it by no other means than giving them pre-coded commands. The number of commands are limited per level, so you must make logical deductions while you predict the result of your command. As you dive deeper into the levels, there would be more game mechanics to explore. The game has 45 hand-made levels that experiment with the game's mechanics in a wide variety of ways, requiring player to understand and manipulate the rules in order to figure out the answers.",
