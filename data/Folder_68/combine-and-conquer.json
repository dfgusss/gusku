    "About the game": "Combine And Conquer is a relaxing, multi-planetary, 2D factory automation game. Mine resources, craft new items and structures via recipes and generate your own, custom building blocks. Expand your factory to span across multiple planets. Discord Reddit There's currently no in-game tutorial. Please make sure to take a look at the guide before playing. You can also find it within your game's local data. There's also a demo of Combine And Conquer which offers all the features of the full game except for the ability to load games. With the demo you can freely test the entire game and pick up where you left once you decide to get the full version (you'll have to manually copy the savegames). Use miners combined with arms and belts to extract the planet's natural resources to feed your factory's ever-growing hunger. With the help of furnaces you can turn raw ores into plates. Use assemblers to craft basic items from plates. Which then serve as input for more complex recipes. Craft new structures such as belts and arms to further expand your factory. Unlock new technologies to increase your factory's throughput and size and to unlock more useful structures. Use the planner feature to create custom blueprints. Which can then be turned into new buildings blocks (modules) for your factory. This way you can create new, custom assemblers which may support any recipe. You can even use your previously generated modules when planning new ones. Use your custom modules to further expand your factory. There's more than enough 'space' left. Colonize new planets and transfer resources between them to connect their factories.",
