    "About the game": "Corpse Box Racers is a bizarre and silly local multiplayer party game where players compete as corpses in cardboard boxes to finish challenges and races against one another. The game can be played in two different game modes. Campaign mode (1-4 players) and Tournament mode (2-4 players) Tournament In this mode you and your friends compete against each other in a series of fast-paced challenges. Where at the end, the player who won the most challenges is crowned the winner. These Challenges can be anything from throwing skee-ball with your corpse, getting the furthest up a hill while avoiding big bouncy balls, or racing through a race track to be the first at the finish line. Tournament mode holds 96 levels, including the campaign levels. Campaign The Campaign mode acts as a linear set of 48 levels where you try to race as fast as you can through increasingly difficult levels.",
