    "About the game": "Curl! is a first-of-its-kind game, built from the ground up for accessibility including integrated control through brain-computer interface (BCI), switch-access or other input schemes in addition to traditional controllers. CURLING IN SPACE!?! It’s a wacky mishmash of strategical sporting action that up to 4 players can enjoy. Slide ahead of your foes with a foolproof strategy. Weave each stone carefully down the ice to land victory in your orbit. Astound the crowd with explodinating, zappifying, and mind-discombobulating uber-cool super-stones! What’s that? Curling doesn’t have explosions? Sure, your primitive Earth curling might not, but Curl! does! STRANGE PLACES AND SILLY FACES The galaxy is a huge and wonderfully weird place. A zany lineup of competitors face off on all manner of slick sheets from across the universe! Try to hit the button on the tongue of a gigantic, homely space worm, or speed through the cosmos on the front of a comet! WANT MORE HUMANS? Play locally or online with up to 4 players! Form the ultimate duo and take on the galaxy’s toughest competitors, or face off against each other in 1v1, 1v2, or 2v2 action! INTEGRATED BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE TRAINING AND CONTROLS! Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology enables individuals to control a computer using their thoughts. Curl! is the first of its kind to enable full BCI integration directly within the game, including headset connection, calibration, training, and direct thought-to-action play. To support community and local play between all players, multiple BCI headsets can be used to control separate characters on the same local computer. SWITCH ACCESSIBLE MENUS AND UI Menus and UI systems designed for use via switch-scanning selection, compatible with simple BCI alternative access. BCI Specific Information: BCI Headset Compatibility - Currently Curl! supports only headsets available through Emotiv . Additional headset support is planned in future updates. Players using a BCI headset should follow their device's specific installation instructions prior to use to use these features.",
