    "About the game": "Dawn of Yokai is built for PC, Mobile and Tablet devices. Purchase of this game include files for each respective device. This single player RPG takes place in Japan and explores the Shinto belief in entities known as Yokai. It is a turn based combat game traversing several different cities in Japan as the game progresses. This game does involve a level of strategy in battle. A healthy mix of healing and damage is the most effective way to clear the game. There are three or more Easter Eggs hidden within this game. Can you find them all? Also, the game is meant to be replayed after beating the final boss but which path will you choose? The choice is yours hero! You play as Oliver, a young warrior born pure of heart. He is on a quest to attend the annual festival with his friends. Surely nothing could go wrong... This game was built using RPG Maker. It is my first game so please leave helpful comments and report any bug that you may experience.",
