Immerse yourself in this dark and atmospheric environment with dynamic audio which adapts to the way you play and makes each playthrough slightly unique. Uncover the story of William, a once renowned alchemist, now lost to his own schizophrenic mind. Dig up the remnants of Williams forgotten past and the reason for his amnesia through the power of colors, which allow you to solve many puzzles scattered throughout this inconspicuously twisted mansion. Features: Power of colors: A lightsource has been a staple in nearly all horror games, use it to your advantage! Find and unlock new colors to your lantern which allow you to explore the mansion further and progress the story in this semi-open, metroidvania-style mansion. Procedural experience: Experience procedurally generated events and scares in the game, making each gameplay feel just a little different.
