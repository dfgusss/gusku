    "About the game": "English A-game is a comprehensive English course in the form of a video game. It is a fun English language game to teach you basic English (level A1) up to upper intermediate level (B1 – upper B2) and to boost your vocabulary and skills like listening, reading, and writing in English. Included are an in-game user guide and English grammar tutorial for self-study. Designed for Polish learners of English. In English A-game, British English is predominantly utilized in spelling and this game is narrated by a native United States speaker. This lively interactive learning game transports students — especially kids and youngsters — into a fantastical, futuristic world where they build their English skills by conversing with robots and visiting a zoo, where they learn all about the animals and come face to face with a talking troll, who can answer their questions and model correct English pronunciation. Violence-free, the game offers also familiar features of popular video games, such as an endless runner and a shooting ground — where the player targets English words instead of adversaries. This game was specially designed for Polish learners of English and immerses users in the experience by allowing them to select their character’s gender and choose first- or third-person play. They will progress through six levels of difficulty, from very easy to challenging, and there are even two levels for pre-readers. Included are an in-game user guide and English grammar tutorial for self-study. Filled with riddles, fun tasks and entertaining exercises, this game is an ideal way to help users master the basics of English or refresh their knowledge at home, but it can also be used as a supplementary educational tool in a school setting or during private lessons. Learning English through play makes it a pleasure instead of a chore! English A-game is a fun and exciting English language game to boost not only your vocabulary but skills like listening, reading and writing in English by completing different exercises through easy to understand instructions. Suitable for ages 5 to 105.",
