    "About the game": "Background: In 2100, the temperatures have risen by 4 ℃, and as a result, a doomsday disaster formed on the earth. So the survivors were on the road to self-redemption. One day, in a meteorite crater, the survivors found many Mayan monuments and crystals with mysterious power. Afterward, the battle for the crystal began… Main Gameplay: Kill your opponent in the arena, and grab the dropped crystals to gain points. Players with the highest points will win the game. The more points players get, the bigger they will become, and the attack range will become bigger. However, be careful, the movement speed will also decrease at the same time… Map Mechanics: The competitive map is full of crises, highly toxic contaminated liquid, hidden grass, weak and slow poisonous fog, and inaccessible tornadoes, making the battle more tense and exciting. Game Mode: '1P' is the individual battle mode for a single player; '3P' is the team battle mode for 3 players. There is also a custom open room mode to invite friends to play against each other. Heroic Characters: Many heroes with different skills make the battle process more strategic and interesting. Special Weapons: Distinctive weapons with different appearances make you the shining star on the battlefield.",
