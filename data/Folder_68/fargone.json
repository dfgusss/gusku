    "Name": "Fargone",
    "Release date": "Dec 23, 2022",
    "About the game": "Enter The Barrens, a land destroyed by a suspicious nuclear disaster. The Barrens is home to many including the roaming corpses of those that fell to the infection caused by the disaster. Those left alive have grouped into factions and fight for control, each with their own goals and ideas. How you choose to survive and who with, is entirely up to you. This is Fargone. Make enemies or allies with the dynamic faction system. Explore the dark and atmospheric lands of The Barrens. Defend yourself against a variety of undead monsters including bosses. Create your own safe corner of the world with the camping system or fortify existing locations. Scavenge, loot and craft to build up your survivor. RPG skill system (currently an early version due to be expanded soon). Dynamic weather and biome system. Each zone has a unique atmosphere and weather, from toxic rain in the Hazzard zone to the calming snow of the mountains. 100's of items to collect ranging from consumables, medicines, equipment, weapons and much more. Dynamic stats system; your character can become unwell, infected and even break bones. Take care of yourself or suffer the consequences! Long term support during and after the early access launch. Lots of planned content with regular updates coming soon! Multiplayer This feature deserves it's own section due to it's importance. Fargone has always been built around the idea of having coop, and it WILL HAVE COOP SOON . However, for the launch of the game and the growing complexities of the AI system and others, I have made the decision to hold the launch of coop back until the game has launched and settled. Multiplayer is currently targeted at being a 1-4 player experience. The focus on human AI and factions makes for a strong single player experience at launch that I hope you will love as much as I have creating it! Join the discord to get in touch!",
