What is rogue-like? Enter the dungeon and complete the deepest floor. The dungeon changes every time, for example, items, monster placement, traps, and shops. Requires flexible response. Think and choose the most valuable action. Story In the otherworld, sword and magic otherworld. The evil demon dominates this world. One time, a young woman, who trains to defeat evil, meets a suspicious man. The man says, 'Please enter this dungeon. You will power up very much. You have the talent to gain power from the dungeon.' She doubts the man, but she has no guess to power up. She decides to enter the dungeon.",
