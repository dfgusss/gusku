    "About the game": "what Is Find the Gnome? Find the Gnome 2 is a hidden object game with cute gnomes and a bit of action. Move around the scene, try to spot the gnomes that try to hide out of sight. They can be everywhere, so watch carefully. When a gnome starts running, chase it down with your drone. Make sure it doesn't hide again, by blocking the objects it is heading to. Find the Gnome 2 comes with a full set of hand drawn comics, presented with a parallax camera. Immerse yourself in the Dutch mythology of gnomes and follow the inventor Tjebbe on his journey to save his home town. Journey through the forest, over the farms and through the village to the city. And all while listening to a variety of chill soundtracks, matching to the environment and the current action. Use the overhead map to keep track of your progress, replay levels, or watch the comics again. And if you like the gameplay: continue after the story completion to find all collectables, run levels again with randomized locations, try to find and complete all achievements and/or do speedruns (tools included). features As much interaction as possible.
