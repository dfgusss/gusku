It combines elements from games both old and new, and includes a ranking system based on player performance. You play as a former police officer taking justice in your own hands (literally), as you tear your way through the criminal element of the city, trying to put an end to the manufacturing and spreading of a dangerous new drug known as Strutusol. Fast-paced gameplay with several different powers to help you overcome your enemies Master your tools to improve your ranking Test your mettle throughout multiple levels, each requiring different approaches Discover hidden secrets throughout each level Special thanks to Janne Mustakallio and Eerik Annola for producing the original music in this game. *This game is a student project created over a period of 9 weeks, and as such should primarily be considered as a demonstration piece.",
