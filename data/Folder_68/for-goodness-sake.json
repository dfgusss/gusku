    "About the game": "Every early December another kid from your school goes missing, and rumors on the playground have circulated that it's related to Krampusnacht- the night that a half-goat half-demon named Krampus comes and steals away naughty children and spares the good. But what is it that determines if people are taken by Krampus? For Goodness Sake is a very short horror text heavy game , focusing on several trolley problem situations. While completing the chores around the house, you find yourself reflecting on situations involving the neighborhood kids that have gone missing &amp; ultimately deciding what you think might have been the right thing to do. Will you be taken by Krampus at the end of the night like the others, or will you be spared? Playtime: 15-20 minutes. 3D first person navigation Ending depends on your answers given Rich audio design and atmosphere Created in one month, for the HauntedPS1 community's Madvent Calendar 2022 project. This was created as a small mental break from DEAD LETTER DEPT, an atmospheric typing horror game currently in development.",
