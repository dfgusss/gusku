However, an unexpected emergency broadcast warns you of a new immediate danger. Survive each level and wait for help to arrive! GAMEPLAY In 'From The Rain' you will be alerted of a civil danger emergency which is effective in your county. Defend your house from the entity that attempts breaking in by restarting the generator and charging each lock for every entrance. The entity is smart. It will watch you and attempt the best strategy possible for breaking in. For each hour (or level) of the game, the entity will grow smarter, stronger, and faster. Reboot the generator and charge the locks. Be smart and strategic with every choice you make, because it matters. KEY FEATURES Single-player You alone must face the threat that looms over your safety.
