COUCH GAMING WITH FRIENDS FROM AFAR GameVRoom provides a new type of social experience for playing non-VR games in VR: Invite up to three friends in multiplayer mode - only the host needs to own the non-VR game.

TAILOR-MAKE YOUR GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE Lots of unique tools and features give you the ability to: Emulate a mouse, keyboard, or gamepad for seamless movement in ways tailored for VR. Bind controller actions, poses and gestures like twisting your hand or reaching over your shoulder to perform actions on your PC.
