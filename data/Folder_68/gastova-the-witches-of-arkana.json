    "About the game": "Gastova is a lighthearted 2D adventure game. As the Witch Guardian of Arkana, embark on a journey to track down and defeat the fellow witches that were once Gastova’s classmates and/or closest friends. Inspired by classics such as Mega Man and Wonder Boy , we are committed to deliver a satisfying single-player experience for all the fans of the retro platforming genre. Something is amiss with the witches that guard the Elemental Founts of Arkana. Gastova, the current Guardian Witch, sets out on a journey to discover the reason behind the strange behavior of her former classmates and fellow witches, and to restore the founts and their strained friendships back to normal. As long as the links that bind the Guardian Witch and the Founts together is restored, Gastova will be able to utilize the power of all the other witches who finds her worthy. Defeat the other witches to receive their blessing and awaken Gastova’s power to channel her friends’ magic, and find out the truth behind the mysterious individual sowing all the chaos behind the scene! Gastova embraces the most fundamental principle of the platforming genre. You jump, you dodge, and you shoot. The core gameplay revolves around adventuring through 8 distinct landscapes, and overcoming the obstacles within them. Every area will be divided into two parts, with a challenging boss waiting for you at the end of each area. Find and defeat a unique and vast selection of enemies. Each area of the game has their own sets of mobs that can only be fought in these places, each with their own abilities to spice up your adventure! Face off against the Fount Guardians and their Protectors in a wild variety of boss battles! Defeat these challenges to receive their blessings, strengthening Gastova in the process! Acquire powerful Staves along the way that grant Gastova unique attacks! They are useful to counter and defeat different enemies found in the world of Arkana. Powerful foes will always have a higher chance of granting you that special Staff! As your bonds with your former friends begin to mend, their powers manifest in many unique forms: Be it with powerful super attacks of your Staff, or in the form of adorable but fierce companions, who will assist Gastova in unique ways! Defeat your foes, and they will grant you wealth, alongside health and mana recovery items to assist you in your journey. In the world of Arkana, there are many random chests and other little secrets to uncover. But beware! We hear some strange creature likes to mimic those cozy little chests... Along the way, Gastova may find special currency that she’ll be able to use to enhance her elemental abilities and companions, as well as special stones that grand her stat improvements. The shop has the most curious items to sell, so make sure to spend those treasures!",
