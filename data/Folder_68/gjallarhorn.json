    "About the game": "About This Game: Set two years following the events of The Great Gaias , this stand-alone installment in the world of the Codex Eternal showcases the circumstances surrounding the northern Osirian Empire and their acceptance of a new world order ravaged by war and betrayal. Gjallarhorn aims to connect the playstyle of the D20 Ruleset and the JRPG in what we are calling a Western Fusion JRPG. Weaving a world where every non-player character has a routine and schedule, we hope to bring a completely unique and customizable experience with every playthrough utilizing choice and consequence. Story: Two years following the Second Great War, the Osirian Empire wrestles with finding a new ruler. While each faction sees a different future for their people, decisions are made by strength, not through ideals, and only the dead have seen the end of war. Lost in a strange land you know nothing about, you must forge a destiny in this harsh environment. Every choice has a consequence that could shape the course of history in the coming struggle. Will you pick a cause in the coming conflict or venture out on your own to seek fortune, fame and glory?
