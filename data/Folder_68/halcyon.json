    "About the game": "Rediscover Earth An era of birth and regrowth breathes new life into the world…but not for humanity. Fight your way through giant insects, mutated birds, and much, much worse. All against the backdrop of stunning parallax environments, colorful backdrops, and the hauntingly beautiful remnants of a long departed Anthropocene. Fight, Fly, Survive Shoot your way through ground and aerial combat encounters, armed only with your plasma rifle and flight bot. Respite is scarce. Supplies are scarcer. Your journey will be marked by the corpses of those who came before you. Fulfill Humanity’s Last Hope Sent by Mothership Terra, you will be pushed to your limits as you battle through unique biomes and hazardous hellscapes. You will face a myriad of malformed creatures thriving in the now fertile wasteland your people left behind. Can you survive this inhuman halcyon? A Nostalgic Indie Debut A game by Raleigh and Keirdan. A triumphant debut title from Real Action Labs, this 2D pixel art side-scrolling shooter is made possible by the hard work and passion of two independent developers. @RealActionLabs / @PaladinGoth @Audio_Dread Special thanks to… SToffler, @StofflerPxL for revamping art and creating the opening cinematic And Renan Costa, @drakerino for designing and animating the trailer",
