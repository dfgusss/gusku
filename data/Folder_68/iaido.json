    "About the game": "Have you ever been fascinated by the Iaido slash in anime or games? Have you struke an Iaido pose with a toy sword, an utility knife or even a pen, while the scene of enemies slashed apart flashes in your mind? Then some cool words may came out of your mouth as well. Have you ever been told that Iaido Slash is actually useless, yet it just can't ruin your fun? True. I do. So I designed this game. VR should not only mean to be a simulator of the things we know because the real world sucks. VR should be able to bring virtual concepts and imaginations closer to the reality. Act like Himura Kenshin, Ukyo Tachibana, Agatsuma Zenitsu or Vergil here. The katana in your hand is your only weapon in the game. You need to read the attacks of various enemies and block them to build advantages. Remember your attack is decisively powerful at the moment your katana leaves its holster. You can cut the enemy in half, or burst the time dilation and cut it into pieces, and of course, you can tear everything apart in the dedicatedly sheathing moment with bonuses from accuracy. Dance with your enemies as they move, try to beat you up wielding numerous weapons. They will even try to knock you back or finish it with a levitation batter!",
