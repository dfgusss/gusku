    "About the game": "INCOMER is a retro-styled 90s first-person shooter game which pitches you against hordes of alien intruders in an attempt to contain a fallen base. With only a small array of weapons and limited ammo, you must fight through six claustrophobic levels as you attempt to contain the outbreak - alien by alien. Although your gun can tear through enemies quickly, you are only human. Only a few hits may be enough to kill you. In INCOMER, you should always plan your approach carefully. INCOMER uses a RPG system mechanic to roll enemy stats every time they spawn, meaning that no two enemies will ever be the same. FEATURING,.,, Amazing graphics and sound An engaging single player campaign An array of atmospheric sound effects Written exclusively for Steam Six nail-biting levels of puzzles, traps, and a host of mean, ugly, and nasty alien creatures",
