    "About the game": "INPUT6 is set in alternative reality inspired by our world in the early 1990s. Search through the abandoned factory owned by TECH-AID ROBOTICS, an infamous company known for its autonomous, interactive, humanoid robots designed supposedly to help with everyday activities. Find hidden remotes that control the robots, discover the company’s past and uncover all the events that led to its collapse. Pay attention to your surroundings, there is something else in the factory besides you... INPUT6 is a first-person, short, fast-paced horror game. One of the game's main mechanics is switching between the 'inputs' - the game takes place simultaneously in separate segments of the company's facility, which you can switch between at any time. Switching can also protect you from a malfunctioning robot. After the robot enters your field of view, you only have a brief moment to react - you must switch the input to avoid getting blocked from moving around the current segment of the factory. Your main task in a single playthrough is to find all 5 remote controls, which appear in different places each time you start the game (one for every seperate section of the facility). You can also find items containing information that may help you unravel the company's mysterious history and uncover what led to its collapse. However, you need to hurry - you have a limited amount of time. Sometimes during the gameplay a small window with a mini-game might pop up. If you lose the mini-game one of the negative effects will temporarily make the game a bit more difficult. You are also able to check the archives where you can take a closer look at the items you found during the main part of the game. Collect all of them and maybe you will be able to figure out what led to the company's collapse.",
