    "About the game": "This game is about a group of chickens, they do not want to become food, and then run away. Players must use their own brains to help chickens escape and adopt their own perfect strategies. The game production is very exquisite, and more than 100 levels make you enjoy playing. After passing the training level, you will enter the Legendary Adventure Mode, then the Survival Mode, and then the Terrible Ultimate Mode. The difficulty will gradually increase. Game items and props are very rich. Ladders, brick walls, springs and other items will help to clear customs. Game features: The chicks will hatch slowly from the eggs and move around. You need to make rational use of limited obstacles to ensure the survival of chickens. Chickens will die directly if they encounter fire or fall to the ground from high altitude!",
