    "About the game": "Have you ever dreamed of living in your favorite game? Haven't you? Come try a totally unknown one! Join Blue and his friends on an exciting adventure inside 'Virtual Adventure,' a totally immersive virtual reality game! Explore a vast world, fight and level up like in the most classic RPGs! You will be 'kidnapped', like the protagonists, by this story full of twists and turns! Each character has unique characteristics and his own sense of humor (you'll soon understand!). Get to know the inhabitants of the world of 'Virtual Adventure' and discover the history surrounding it! Inspired by classic RPGs, such as Final Fantasy, Breath of Fire, Dragon Quest and many others, 'The Adventures of Blue' will give you an old-fashioned experience, retracing the ways of the past but without forgetting that you are in the present! (Or, at least... in 2021-22!) Key Features: 1) Let's break the fifth wall! The game (or rather, its developer) talks directly to the player! You will get clues and, why not, some teasing! You'll get a chance to feel like the real protagonist...although Blue may not take it well! 2) Politically (Un)Correct! 'Blue's Adventures' was created to 'offend' (in a very witty way) everyday issues, so that you can face them with a mocking smile on your lips! 3) Packed with quotes to the great classics! Will you be able to find all the references? 4) Medium difficulty! Designed for the 'uninitiated' to RPGs, it holds no secrets for those more experienced in the genre! Have fun discovering new tactics based on the protagonists' ever-changing abilities. 5) Side activities! Discover side quests, reward items and secret bosses scattered around the game world!",
