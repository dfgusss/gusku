    "About the game": "Lost Abroad Café is a language learning game that puts you in the role of a virtual café owner in a foreign country. As you serve customers and grow your business, you will learn and master your new language. With a variety of available languages and the ability to unlock new equipment and features for your coffee shop, Lost Abroad Café is the perfect way to learn and study. Try it now on Steam Early Access and start (or continue) your language learning journey today! To get started, first select the location for your coffee shop among 7 cities across the world, with more coming up! Learn Spanish, French, Italian, German, Chinese (Mandarin), Korean, or Japanese by opening up shop in Mexico City, Paris, Milan, Berlin, Shanghai, Soeul, or Kyoto! Then, check out your store with an initial set of equipment and a simple menu. Click on the tutorial buttons with the question mark to be given a tutorial on how to make specific drinks – in this game, you learn not by being given a translation, but by performing the action itself. This helps your brain associate new words with real life actions. Then when you’re ready, hit PLAY and serve up the customers that enter your store. But don’t’ get it wrong or else the customer will reject your order! If they’re too impatient, your store’s star rating will go down. Once you’ve got enough money, buy more equipment to expand your menu. Keep practicing, serving customers, and buying equipment to keep learning! Stay motivated by competing with other players on the leaderboard each day, week, month, and all time. How many customers can you serve? Lost Abroad Café is currently in active development, and you can influence what we build next by joining our Discord! Interact with other language learners and give us direct feedback on how the game plays and what you want to see built next. Learning a new language has numerous benefits, including improved cognitive function and memory, expanded career opportunities, and the ability to connect with people from different cultures. With Lost Abroad Café, you can learn a new language in a fun and engaging way that immerses you in the language and culture. Through regular practice and repetition, you will improve your language skills and, most importantly, be able to associate what you learn with real objects and actions, not just text-based translations. Join the growing community of language learners and get Lost Abroad Café now on Steam Early Access. With a fun and engaging game-based approach to language learning, regular updates and new features, and the support of our active Discord community, Lost Abroad Café is the perfect way to improve your language skills and open up a world of possibilities.",
