Grab your electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) gun to eliminate armed robot dogs with bad AI, reset computer to stop bad AI virus and rescue your team in a Lunar lava tube cave. Learn about Lunar lava tubes and how they may become the home for future astronauts on the Lunar south pole, and how AI can be a threat to humans.
