    "About the game": "Lying Souls™ is an atmospheric, mysterious single player story horror game. You'll dive into a story in which nothing is as it seems. Find out the reasons behind what happened to your family back then. Your decisions will guide the course of the story. THE INCIDENT It was a while ago when all this happened. With time, the incident has calmed down. You don't know anything anymore and step by step you find out the truth and why it all happened. YOUR DECISIONS You are now on a dangerous path of darkness. Are you someone who runs away from your problems, or do you face them? It is entirely your decision. It is up to you alone whether you can clear up the incident and find out the truth. LYING SOULS In Lying Souls™ you'll enter a story in which you'll have to solve, in first person, the mysterious circumstances of a long-past incident in your family. You'll experience different parts of the story and you'll have to logically sort everything. The gameplay is linear, but the story is not. MAIN FEATURES Interactive Story / Own Decisions: You will obviously have to make a decision at some moments that will change the later course of the story for you. Smaller, not so obvious decisions &amp; actions are also part of this. Whether you will find out everything with your decisions is questionable. Notes / Recordings: You will come across a number of audio recordings and various writings and notes. They will help you put the story together. Not everything may always be clearly told / revealed and you will have to find your own explanation. Random Events: You will experience random events from time to time. These are not random 'paranormal' events to create a mood, but are always part of the current story and gameplay when they happen.",
