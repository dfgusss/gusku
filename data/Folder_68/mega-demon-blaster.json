    "About the game": "Mega Demon Blaster is a casual bullet hell game where the goal is to make crazy builds that either brake the game or get you as many points as you can! After every arena clear you get to pick a new upgrade. Every playthrough is something new, make a new build from what you have learned! You can't hide anywhere so better be prepared to face all the enemies head on. You will die, there is no question about it. There might even be some powerful enemies to destroy in your path!",
