    "About the game": "Introduction Minesweeper Tetris is a brand new 2D casual game that combines the best elements of two classic games, Minesweeper and Tetris. The difference from traditional Minesweeper is that the minefield of Minesweeper Tetris is constantly growing upwards, and the player will not die immediately after hitting the mine by mistake, but the size of the minefield grows until it reaches the edge. Similar to Tetris, the row is cleared when the player finds all the mines in a row. As the number of eliminated lines increases, the minefield will grow faster, making the game more hard and exciting. There are three difficulties in the game: Easy, Normal and Hard. You can also customize the size of the board and the number of mines through shortcut keys. When the game is over, the player's score will be recorded in the high score list so that they can compete with other players. Gameplay Right-clicking will mark the square as a question mark instead of a flag. Only when the square is absolutely certain that there are no mines will it be marked as a flag, e.g. left click on a mine. You can mark a square as flag by right clicking on the number around it, you don't have to click left and right buttons simultaneously. When you right-click the number, the game will automatically and intelligently mark the flag according to the situation of marked, unmarked squares and mines. Feature The in-game help will teach you the methods, rules and techniques of minesweeping with illustrations. The hidden AI system can automatically clear mines, helping you understand and learn the process of minesweeping. The built-in music in the game can also help you relieve nervous tension during the game.",
