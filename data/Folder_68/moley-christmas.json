    "About the game": "Originally released on a cassette tape that came with the Christmas edition of the ZX Spectrum magazine Your Sinclair in 1987, this oft-forgotten entry in Gremlin Graphics' Monty Mole series of challenging platformers saw players once again take on the role of the intrepid subterranean mammal, this time trying to get the very game you are playing to the duplication plant so it can be out for Christmas! Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Gameplay Guide Monty through a series of challenging levels, jumping, climbing, dodging bizarre enemies and collecting useful items. First, at Gremlin's offices find the printout of the game's computer code, then it's on through the Mastering Plant to have the code turned into a master cassette tape. Next is the Duplication Plant to turn the master tape into enough tapes for all the issues of Your Sinclair! Err... well... at least eight copies anyway. Then hitch a lift on the M1 back to London, and finally to the newsagents to pick up a copy of Your Sinclair. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
