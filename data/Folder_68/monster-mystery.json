    "About the game": "“It’s so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone.” - John Steinbeck (MONSTER MYSTERY) It is a 3 - 10 player Third Person Survival Multiplayer game where the players take the role of an Explorer or the Hidden. As the Explorer, the player tries to find out the identity of the Hidden. You do this by fixing Generators around the map that then turn on the Big Generator that reveals the identity of the Hidden. As the Hidden, the player turns in and out of the Monster forum to try and kill the Explorers without the Explorers finding out who they are. Vision: The night is dark and your lanterns are dim. You must refuel your lanterns at fireplaces scattered around the map, but make sure to fill them with boards because when they all go out all hope is lost. ITEMS: There are many items scattered throughout the map that the explorers will need to fix the Generators. These items are the Axe, Toolbox, Batteries, Boards and the Blunderbuss . The Explorers win by killing the Hidden and the Hidden wins if they kill all Explorers.",
