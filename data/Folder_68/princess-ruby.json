    "About the game": "Princess Ruby is a 2D Platformer where you play as a princess running through each level to collect items stolen from her castle by a dragon. The game was designed for young children and can be played in 2 player Local Co-Op, it can be challenging but the controls are simple. 2 Player Local Co-op Drop in and out local Co-op if you have a controller. If you reach the next checkpoint the other player can teleport to it, letting you help new players skip sections that are too hard. Designed for New Players The game can be played with only 1 button on each hand at a time, making it easier to play for young children or others new to games. Choose Your Challenge On normal mode collecting gems will give you extra lives and if you fail a level 3 times a golden heart will make you invulnerable. Or choose hard mode for a true challenge with only 1 extra life to complete each level, and the last levels are not easy! Your Own Princess Choose from a variety of appearance options, and unlock new costumes as you complete levels. Make your princess your way, changing your appearance as well as the color of your costume. Unlock new costumes as you complete levels, like the knight, cowgirl, superhero and witch. You might even be able to change the color of your unicorn if you can find it. Castles, Dragons and Unicorns A dragon has used its magic to take everything from your castle, your toys, your pets and even your parents! Rescue them from each level and you will be able to play with them in dollhouse hub level.",
