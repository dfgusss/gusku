    "About the game": "Quarterstaff is an abstract action strategy game playable with one hand and at your own pace. Stand up against overwhelming odds using graceful acrobatics and powerful spells in this turn-based fantasy adventure. Immerse yourself in hours of flowing gameplay or enjoy the game in tiny bursts around your busy schedule. OUTNUMBERED Take your time to wisely plot your attacks, using your foresight to defeat legions of opponents. Keep the hordes at bay with only your quarterstaff, staggering and defeating opponents with seamless momentum and rhythm, or use magic to cast spells of teleportation and mind-control. Reward yourself with an instant replay of your victories, where you can relive the glory of your strategic prowess in an action-packed video recap of your encounter. CHALLENGE THE TYRANT Travel a once-peaceful fantasy realm now trapped in the oppressive thrall of an ambitious Wizard King dead set on achieving total domination. The only possible hope for this realm rests in the Wandering Wizard that just came to town… will you answer the challenge? Battle your way through sixteen (...and more to come!) unique challenging puzzle fights spread throughout four separate regions, or hone your skills in the Arena's speed trials and endurance matches. Explore the potential of your abilities by attempting the bonus objectives in every map. Win or lose, you'll gain renown to unlock new spells and powers. Replay an action using the Undo spell, or replay a whole level as often as you like - even it's just to set a new high score! Additional regions and missions will be added as development proceeds.",
