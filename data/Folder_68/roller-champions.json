    "About the game": "Skate, tackle, and roll your way up to glory in Roller Champions™. Discover a free-to-play, team PvP sports game like no other! Welcome to 2032. Arenas are built all over the world and fans rush to the stands to admire their modern-day heroes, the Roller Champions. They roll up to 100 miles an hour, tackle opponents, wall-skate, and dunk while thousands of fans scream their names. As a Roller Champion, compete in a team of three against three. The rules are simple: take the ball, make a lap while maintaining team possession, dodge opponents, and score. Go for more points by completing additional laps before attempting a goal. After each match, gain fans to compete in bigger arenas. Customize characters and create a unique destiny. GATHER YOUR TEAM AND COMPETE Team up with two players and dive into Roller Champions’ gameplay, which combines fun competitive action and collaborative team play. Go head-to-head against the opposing team through speed, wit, crushing tackles, and daring dodges to lap around the arena and be the first team to reach 5 points by throwing the ball through the hoop. Feel the thrill of riding up and down the wall of the arena as you gain speed, quickly stop, pivot, and re-position as your teammates race towards the goal, just one pass away from winning or one interception away from having to start all over again.
