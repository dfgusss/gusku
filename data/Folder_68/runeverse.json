Runeverse has a simple and fun gameplay, we combined the best elements of card games to create a simple and fun but incredibly strategic game. Factions and Alliances. In the Runeverse Universe 6 Factions coexist, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Choose two Factions to create your Alliance, but it's up to you to find the winning synergy! Random Effects?
