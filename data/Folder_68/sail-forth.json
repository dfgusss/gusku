    "About the game": "Explore the Deepblue! • Put the wind to your back and cast out into High Adventure over a vast ocean spanning dozens of eccentric regions. • Discover countless isles bursting with their own flora, fauna, friendly folk, and fearsome foes. • Playfully pursue a pod of curious dolphins, admire the beauty of the sun sinking into an icy horizon, or run down a clutch of cowardly criminals only to accept their apologies to the tune of wild cannonry. Command a Sailing Fleet! • Build and manage a custom cadre of specialized vessels to match any personality and play style. • Buy, equip, upgrade, and modify your ships’ armaments to face off against the toughest privateers this side of the Eclipside. • Crack open giant clams and loot lonely shipwrecks to fill your fleet’s treasure hoard and keep your crew in shipshape. Fathom a Mystery! • Join forces with the myriad inhabitants of this watery world to uncover a terrible secret buried in the depths of the Deepblue. • Reel in a big one with the salty Anglerwranglers, learn the secret spyspeak of the Croaker Command Corps, save the sea life of the Moontiders, capture picturesque memories with a mysterious “camera” device, and much more. • Inspire the finefolk from all over to work as one world-spanning crew to save the seas and the planet. Sail Forth into Adventure! • Tack and jibe and heave and cut with a sail and wind system designed with enough attention to realistic sailing physics to excite naval enthusiasts while also remaining deeply accessible to anyone and everyone. • Sail through stormy swells and serene sunsets in a dynamic and breathtaking day-night weather system. • Bask in the beauty of the benevolent ocean waters in Free Sail mode where the only goal is the ever-moving horizon. The Deepblue calls with the bellow of High Adventure! Sail Forth! As a very small team, every Wishlist and Follow on Steam goes a very long way for us.",
