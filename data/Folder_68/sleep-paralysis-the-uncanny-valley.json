As the days go on you will suddenly awaken... you don't have a sleep paralysis... it's still your room, but something feels different... something IS different. In the following chapters, you will face the trauma that has haunted Thomas for a very long time. Afraid of flights? Abusive exes? Traumatizing movies? The backrooms? Experience this trauma in the game. Make different decisions that affect your playthrough, solve puzzles to progress and keep your sanity in check to not lose your mind. There's also gonna be a unique P.T. Loop! Your decisions will also influence whether you will fall into darkness and lose your mind, or survive and come out stronger. Key Features Narrated Story - Thomas is writing about the events that happened to him over the past few days. You are accompanied by his narration.
