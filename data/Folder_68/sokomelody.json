    "About the game": "This Sokoban-styled game is all about placing the correct notes in their respective spaces on the map, forming the songs that you will hear throughout the adventure. Designed with an old school feel in mind, SokoMelody's intent is to make you feel like you're playing on a Game Boy. Levels The game consists of 100 hand crafted levels, that are divided on separate music genres: Rock'n Roll / Pop Rock Classical Jazz Disco / Dance Each one thought to be a complement of the other with creative design and interesting mechanics Story In the game you're part of a band and you, and your friends, are trying to compose some songs to play on the show. To 'compose' the songs you have to pass through all levels and unlock the songs so you'll be able to play them. Can you compose them all, and help our characters get to the show with their songs? Mechanics Based on the Sokoban style games, push the boxes towards the corresponding spaces on the ground",
