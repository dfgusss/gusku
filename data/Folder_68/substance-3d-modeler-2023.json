    "About the game": "Adobe Substance 3D Modeler is an innovative sculpting and modeling app that aims at redefining how we create in 3D by combining VR and desktop experiences with a more natural approach to 3D modeling. This license is perpetual and will get you free updates on Steam up to the end of 2023 Substance 3D Modeler frees you from technical constraints With a Signed Distance Field (SDF) engine at its core, Modeler allows you to model and sculpt without worrying about polycount, topology or subdivision levels. Sculpt away and add matter to your scene without ever the need to retopologize. Start your creation from scratch or import an existing model and convert it to clay to start sculpting. Switch seamlessly between an organic VR experience and the precision of Desktop controls Modeler's VR mode is compatible with Meta Rift, Meta Quest, and Valve Index devices and allows an unparalleled experience for organic sculpting and scene building. The Desktop mode supports mouse + keyboard and tablet pressure for a more traditional approach. Both modes boast a collection of innovative modeling tools allowing you to quickly create complex models and iterate on variations and parts in a non destructive way. Export high poly or optimized models Modeler can output extremely detailed models or decimate, UV and bake it down for you to a real-time friendly, either triangulated or quad-only model. Outputs from Modeler can be sent straight to Substance 3D painter for texturing, directly to an engine or renderer, or even brought into other modelling apps for additional work.
