    "About the game": "SWAP SWAP is a top-down shooter with unique gameplay mechanics, slow-motion and jump &amp; run elements with lots of room for experimentation to dismantle and kill your opponents. Start in the outer atmosphere of a foreign planet and progress to the core of the planet to save your kidnapped dearest. On your way to the core engage in exciting boss fights to save your dearest. The world of SWAP consists of three energies, which lets you interact with the environment and which you have to master to overcome your enemies. Select the right energy quickly while in action to stay on top. SWAP between three energies to damage your enemies, be healed by them, send them to hell with your mighty RageFire, or have an enemy follow you and let it heal you. The gameplay is quick. The player and the standard enemies die after a few hits. This combination of experimentation with quick fights, abbilities and traps leads to exciting and fun gameplay. If you need help, free allies to fight besides you. Use various weapons, abbilities, physics and slow-motion to create your own fighting style and conquer the path that lays ahead. You can use two weapons at a time and freely customize your weapon selection for the primary and secondary attack to experiment with the weapon combinations. Or use traps and the environment to your advantage. Let Tornados do the work for you. Suck your enemies with the gravity gun into a giant ball and shoot them with your laser and energy rockets or strike them with your rotating melee laser. Find hidden weapons and collect RageFire to increase your energy recharge rate and your RageFire, and thus your abbilites. SWAP",
