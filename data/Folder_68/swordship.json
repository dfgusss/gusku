    "About the game": "The world after global warming. Humanity has taken refuge in three gigantic underwater cities at the bottom of the ocean. Those who are expelled from the cities, for lack of space, barely survive on the burned lands. Meanwhile, the megacities exchange millions of containers loaded with goods every day. At the command of ultra-fast boats, a few inhabitants of the underwater cities started stealing these precious containers, in order to deliver them to the banished. Some are more successful than others. TACTICAL Dodge attacks to survive and trick your enemies into killing each other DELIVERY Steal containers and deliver them to upgrade your ship or improve your score ACTION No shooting, but all the action! Guns are cool but they are bulky and heavy: The Swordship doesn't have any and that's part of what makes it so light and maneuverable Ship variant: Collect power-boosting components and experiment with different play styles in your runs Upgrade: Exchange stolen containers for passive upgrades that fit the situation and your play style Weather: Learn to master the different weather conditions to get through the randomly generated levels",
