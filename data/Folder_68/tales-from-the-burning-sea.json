    "About the game": "One thousand years beyond the fall of Earth A digital anthology of mystery and horror; a window onto a post-apocalyptic world like no other... A thousand years have passed since the fall of Earth, and mankind sails a sea of Solar fire. In a heaving city sculpted from the slag of scorched planets, workmen swoop along cables of metal, dangling from slender hooks, praying they don't plummet to their doom. Meanwhile, a young woman finds herself swept up by the dark side of city politics, and farmers tending fields of vat-grown flesh contend with the arrival of dead bodies in their meaty crop. Out at sea and far from civilization, an expedition discovers an ancient tomb-ship, a drifting monument to the sleeping dead, set on its endless voyage centuries earlier. Therein, something stirs... The world may have ended, but humanity persists in all its triumph and tragedy, there among the twisting flames of the Burning Sea.
