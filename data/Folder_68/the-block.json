    "About the game": "NOTE: This is a very small game - more of a tiny little toy really, with no goals or challenges - hence the very small price 🙂 The Block is the world's smallest city builder - a bite sized experience for city builder fans short on time / money / attention / all of the above. Each level is slightly different and can be completed in a matter of minutes. Build up a tiny but perfectly formed city block from randomly generated tiles, try out a variety of colour palettes and map sizes, then sit back, relax, and bask in the glory of your adorable creation! Like my last project The Ramp, The Block is designed more as a ‘digital toy’ than a game: a short, satisfying experience that’ll make your day a little bit better and costs less than a slice of pizza. Thanks for checking out my page! If you have any questions or feedback, I’m all ears.",
