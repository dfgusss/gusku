    "About the game": "The Detroit After is a violent and ruthless top-down shooter with an emphasis on action and fast-paced gunplay. Shoot, break down doors, kick enemies, stun them with the butt of your rifle to complete your missions. Equipped with a powerful new A.I. and extraordinary strength, you will work in the shadows by eliminating the killers of a powerful rival company using the various weapons you will find along your way. • You play as a very tough and advanced robot. • 15 levels of pure action. • Fast-paced gameplay. • Devastating weapons. • Find new chips for various upgrades. • Each hit slows you down. • Each level has its own music track. • Arcade oriented. The story is told in a short and simple way and does not break the rhythm of the game. • A journey from the violent streets of Detroit to the luxurious offices of Techmann, your company's competitor. • Cops and mercenaries, both will be your enemies. They will try to destroy you in every way. In a world increasingly dependent on computers, Hi-Tech companies battle with technological innovations to reach an ever greater number of customers. The need to open up to new markets in order to continue to grow and compete in an increasingly aggressive way, pushes some of these companies to invest heavily in robotics and artificial intelligence. You will embody the result of these incredible technological advances. A robot that will be used to 'facilitate' the rise of the company by carrying out various secret missions. Obviously the police will not stand by as you sow death and destruction and it will be another obstacle that you will have to remove if you do not want to be stopped. A lot of skill and concentration will be required to pass the tests that await you. The enemies will be in great numerical superiority and you will have to carefully evaluate the battleground. You will have to resist all attacks if you do not want to be considered a bad investment and be deactivated by your own creators. You are a big step forward in the field of robotics. Could it possibly be too far ahead? How far is the society that built you to accomplish its goals willing to go? Will these great technological advances only benefit a few? Could there be too much power deriving from these technologies? Find out by playing The Detroit After... Do you want a game with hours of cutscenes? Not the right game. Do you want a game with endless dialogues? Not the right game. Do you want a poem between each stage about the meaning of life? Not the right game. If you are looking for a game that puts you straight into the action, THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU! Enough talk! Now it's time to shoot!",
