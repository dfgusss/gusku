    "About the game": "Do you like monsters? Do you think they are the best part of their respective movies, books, and shows? Then you have to play The Passenger. The Passenger is a 380,000-word interactive cosmic horror novel by Jime Rolón. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. When your eldritch existence is threatened by another unthinkable creature, you find yourself jumping dimensions to escape your ghastly fate. Safe for now, your moment of respite is short-lived as you realize you're stuck on Earth, trapped inside a dumb human larva, and with no clue of how much energy you'll need to leave this horrible place behind. Twenty-six years later you're still stranded on an absurd planet, you have a mom and a sister , and a job delivering baked goods. Not only that, but the creature that almost ate you all those years ago never really stopped looking for you. However, there’s no way it will pinpoint your actual location… right? Play as male, female, or nonbinary You can be trans, cis, gay, straight, bi, ace, partnering aro, or choose to stay single. Pursue romance with a headstrong waitress, a moody store clerk, a mystifying newcomer, or an unconventional cult leader. Four monogamous routes, and one polyamorous route. Will you break free from your prison of flesh?",
