    "About the game": "Throwing Master is a casual competitive game played by two to four players, who make decisions based on the rules of the game and choose their preferred weapon to defeat their opponent. - Requires at least 2-4 players to play. - Players set the rules of the game, choose the scene to fight. - Every scene has its own rules. - 'Bamboo Forest', 'Amusement Park', and 'Mountain Top' have similar rules, and score points by capturing more land, with the player with the highest score winning. They are the standard model. - In Standard mode, weapons that disappear at the end of a turn are marked as active weapons. The earlier the weapon drops, the higher the priority of their valid mark. -Valid tags with larger sequences are corrupted by valid tags with smaller sequences. - Scenes 'Castle War' and 'Desert' are special rules -Castle Wars requires the player's duck knight to snatch an opponent's flag in order to win. - 'Desert' requires player-controlled birds to avoid obstacles and shoot down opponents' nests to win.",
