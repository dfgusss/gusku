    "About the game": "Velocity Rift is a fast-paced first-person shooter where you shoot orbs to defeat enemies and save the world. The number of orbs is limited and take time to return once fired. Shooting enemies' weak spots returns the orbs faster! Also, the faster you move, the slower the world becomes, so always be on the move! Key Features 4 Levels, 4 Worlds Each level is a different dimension, filled with its own thrills and dangers. Speed through and pass through the rift at the end to reach the next dimension! Time Dilation Speed is the name of the game! The faster you move, the slower the world becomes! Keep up the pace and everything will slow to a crawl... and you’ll be glad they did. Combat Ammunition is limited! Orbs you fire take time to travel back, longer if they go wild. Improve your accuracy and make every shot count! Additionally, different ways to eliminate your pursuers are learnt as you pass from dimension to dimension. Using each in the right situation is key to swift victory! 3 Movement Abilities Your movement is augmented over the course of your journey. Combine these abilities to speed your way through each dimension to get the best time possible. Steam Leaderboard Login to Steam before launching the game to access the Steam leaderboards. Compete with others to reach the top and strive for better clear times on all levels! Boss Fights Each dimension has its own guardian, blocking your path to the next... If you can keep up with life on the fast lane, we’ll see you through the rifts!",
