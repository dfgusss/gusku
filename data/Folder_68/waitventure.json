    "About the game": "Waitventure is an idle RPG focused around Time, recruiting monsters and fusioning them to get stronger allies in your party. The game currency is 'seconds', and you get one second/second at first, that can be increased later. After choosing your main character class, you can train your player, level up, increase their stats and learn new skills, by using your time currency. When you are ready for the adventure, you can enter the dungeon, where your party will fight enemies in automated battles, and sometimes, the enemies will join your team! And when you come back to town, if your allies are strong enough, you can fuse them to get monsters and humans from a higher tier, with different stats and abilities. The dungeon is divided into years, months and days, like a calendar. At the end of each day there is a boss, that is stronger than regular enemies, but gives more EXP. Can you reach 31st December and beat the final boss?",
