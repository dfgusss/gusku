Experience the FPS battle to the next level through battles of special abilities beyond humans. [Face your inner Wolf-WOLF transformation] Jump Higher, Run Faster, Climb the Wall, Slay the Human with Stronger Power. You can transform into a wolf while playing, or start playing as a wolf. The combination of humans and wolves allows you to respond more organically to a variety of battlefields, and utilizes the wolf's mobility and flexibility to infiltrate into places where the enemy cannot be prepared.

[Map that reproduces the world's local appearance] The Wolfteam's worldview depicts the battles of special forces and abilities around the world. Accordingly, characteristic streets and landmarks of various regions such as Europe, Turkey, and South America are reproduced intact in the game.
