    "About the game": "Woodrow the Old Piano is a novelty musical toy and MIDI player, using real sounds from a distressed antique piano. You can play this virtual piano using PC keys or a MIDI input device (such as a digital piano) or load in MIDI files to be automatically played pianola-style. Based on a real upright piano from the 1910s which has been sampled and remade in 3D, Woodrow the Old Piano resonates distressed, ragged sounds. Now you too can experience the ear-piercing noises of an out-of-shape antique piano without the inconveniece of stealing one from a haunted house. Woodrow the Old Piano is a standalone musical toy, and not a plugin. Simply open it and enjoy! It's a fun virtual instrument to experiment with, and a charming gift for your musical friends. Play up to 85 keys from a real old-timey piano using your computer keyboard or a MIDI keyboard controller Load in MIDI files for automated playback, pianola-style Features custom-made samples using real recordings from a distressed antique piano Supports sustain pedal (on/off) and velocity sensitivity (key volume) 3D piano keys and pedal react as you press them Complete Steam achievements to prove your mastery of this old timer",
