In 19th century Japan, you’re a humble fisherman who has finally taken over your family’s sushi business. Cooking by day and fishing by night, you strive to uphold your family’s legacy. But once a year, during the blood moon, the fish that swim the sea give way to fearsome cryptids from the deep—the yōkai. Over the course of four nights, use your cursor to explore the ocean depths and hook the most fabled of monsters. Then, drag and drop in quick succession as you transform these strange creatures into the most delectable sushi in the land. And make sure to read your journal entries to discover the lore of the fascinatingly frightening world around you! The fate of the restaurant is in your hands! Can you keep your creatures and your customers reeling in?",
