    "About the game": "A Familiar World gives the usual jigsaw puzzle genre a different spin. Not only does it feature good-looking models in exciting environments and situations, but it also offers a story element that you unlock by completing puzzles. You can do each puzzle in five different difficulties ranging from surprisingly easy to frustratingly impossible. People who seek a challenge can enjoy this game just as much as those that want to lay back and do some simple jigsaw puzzles. The game plays in and around a castle in a post-apocalyptic world. A long and brutal war left only a few strong men alive. Each settled down in their own part of the world. Those men quickly became the center point of small functioning societies comprised of the remaining females. A Familiar World tells the story of nine women, how they found each other, and how they eventually managed to flee their cruel reality. The story element of this game that can be unlocked by completing puzzles works as a Prologue of a visual novel, A Foreign World . The main story will talk about the struggles those nine women face in this new world they flee to. Can you help them?",
