    "About the game": "Note: 3-4 player co-op mode is still experimental. A colony building game with an emphasis on unexpected events, online co-op, and managing a unique community. The story begins with nothing more than a few colonists and limited resources in an unknown world. BUILD YOUR COLONY With the right materials, you can build multi-story buildings, as well as a base that extends underground or into the mountains. In addition, there is a large selection of furniture, pictures and other decoration options to customize the individual rooms according to your wishes. RESEARCH TECHNOLOGIES Research numerous technologies and use them to unlock more advanced weapons, items, machines and other construction elements. The technology tree offers over 50 individual technology fields and is divided into 4 ages - basic, modern, computer and nuclear age. EVENTS While your colony is frequently visited by wanderers, traders, and other groups, less peaceful individuals may also become aware of your community. Whether it's hostile colonists, dangerous animals, or intelligent insects, you should always have a good defense strategy in place. Nature, of course, provides a number of events that can hasten the death of your colonists. PLAY TOGETHER If you play with another player, you will be placed in the same world and each player will control their own colonists. You can trade resources, treat each other's colonists medically, work together to deal with events and attacks, strengthen colonist relationships, and much more. INDIVIDUAL COLONISTS Each colonist is an individual person and has the following characteristics: Expectations: With every new member in your community, the expectations of all other members also increase. They can ask for their own room, specific furniture, special rooms and more. Mood: Your colonists' mood should always be positive; otherwise, dangerous situations can arise. Injuries &amp; Illnesses: Stab wounds, bruises, bleeding, poisoning or diseases are just some of the things that can endanger the lives of your colonists. Skills, Talents and Traits: While your colonists aren't just distinguished by their skills and talents, they also possess defining traits that bring great benefits but also disadvantages.
