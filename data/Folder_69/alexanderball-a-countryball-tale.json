Main Features: Complex Turn-Based Battles Employ intricate tactics! Outflank your opponents for bonus damage! Instruct your infantry to fortify against attacks! Charge your cavalry into your foes! Keep your ranged units out of trouble and feather your enemies with arrows! Utilize your limited action points in any manner of your choosing each turn to command your army. A infinite range of possibilities await on the battlefield! The Living, Breathing World of 4th Century BC Navigate the complicated world of 4th century BC. The world is inhabited by various ‘Balls’, each with their own martial traditions, and each needing to be cajoled to join the Macedonian army. AlexanderBall must choose whether to win over these Balls through gold or glory. Highly Customizable Army Our expert ancient Greek mathematicians have discovered that players will be able to choose from billions of possible army combinations for their playthroughs of the campaigns. Add the wide variety of Alexander’s companions to boot and these numbers keep getting bigger. This wide range of possibilities will apply to PvP multiplayer battles as well, where your all-Bactrian army can smash your friend’s Hellenic League contingent! Empire Management Just as the historical Alexander the Great struggled to unite his disparate and unwieldy empire, AlexanderBall will face countless challenges to keep his empire from falling apart. Placing governors from amongst his companions in important seats of power, while maintaining high opinions with subjects will become a tricky balancing act that will test the players’ management skills. Story-driven Experience Relive and refight some of Alexander’s most iconic battles. As the journey progresses, Alexander’s legendary companions will grow and develop alongside their young king as the story takes them from their Greek homelands to the ends of the known world. Dozens of cutscenes crafted by a devoted art team will bring to life the most iconic moment’s from Alexander’s life and more! PvP Multiplayer Battles Challenge your friends to a duel that will test both players’ army management skills and their knowledge of turn-based tactics. Build a well balanced army with archers, infantry and cavalry, or try out ridiculous combinations such as all-Archer builds just to troll your opponents. Try out various combinations of units and generals and uncover a playstyle that could shake up armchair generalship for years to come! Alternate History (At Full Release) What if Alexander went west instead of east? What if he went north? Answer these questions when the game enters full release with two additional campaigns that are filled with brand new Balls and dozens of new regions to explore and conquer!",
