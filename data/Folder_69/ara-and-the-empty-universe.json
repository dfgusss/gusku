    "About the game": "It's been a few months since everyone mysteriously vanished. You find yourself driving from city to city looking for anyone and anything. But, so far your search has yielded nothing... The animals are still present but, no sign of another human. Despite this, you haven't allowed your spirit to be crushed. You'll keep looking... GAMEPLAY: -W a l k i n g . -The odd password/riddle puzzle. -Wait, don't go, there's a good story, PLEASE- FEATURES: -It's a walking simulator. 1.5 - 2.5 hours in length depending on how much you explore. -Good for fans of character driven and atmospheric stories. -Light horror -Inspired by SCP. -Collectable dolls and costumes! (Some are YouTuber cameos~.) -Fans of game theorying (like the YouTube channel) will have fun with this. Game length: 1.5 - 2.5 hours. This was my FIRST game. It came before 'Our way down' and 'We don't die here.'",
