    "About the game": "A tale about emotions Charlie comes home from school, eager to play with Baya . But in spite of all the effort Charlie puts to cheer her up, the dog doesn't want to play. Overwhelmed by anger , Charlie is suddenly absorbed by a strange vortex and wakes up in a strange world , threatened by a raging volcano. Beautiful hand-drawn graphics We took great care in giving Asfalia a unique visual style , with wonderful places to explore and lovable, quirky characters inspired by all time classics like Alice in Wonderland and the Little Prince. Fully voiced by professional actors We cut no corners in finding the perfect cast of professional voice actors to bring life to the characters. Anyone can enjoy the story, even those who can't read. Simple Point &amp; click gameplay The game is designed to be playable by a 5 year old . Intuitive mouse controls, no cumbersome inventory management, no silly item combinations. When you interact with something, you either have the right item or you don't. As simple as that. You'll never get stuck Asfalia is all about telling a beautiful story, not about solving mind-bending puzzles. The puzzles are there to keep things interesting though, so we can't guarantee there won't be some head scratching at times. Grow your stickers collection Interact with the environment to unlock stickers and add them to your collection. You'll get most of them naturally as you progress through the story, but some of them will require extensive exploration. Replayable Once you finish the game, you can go back to any part of the story you want to finish your collection, replay your favourite cutscenes, re-live your most beloved moments. Relaxing No pressure, no death, no rush. Take the story at your own pace and enjoy the ride. Progress is saved automatically and you can play in short sessions or in one go. It's your call. Welcome to the world of Asfalia",
