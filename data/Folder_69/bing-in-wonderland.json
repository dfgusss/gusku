    "About the game": "Join our discord, help us make game better. Discord: (we are still working on the better english version.) :D Bing in Wonderland is a new entry in the Wanba Warriors franchise. A Roguelite monster killing satisfaction galore without any exploration elements. The game is filled to the brim with exotic enemies and stages with a collection of deep and robust boons, weapons, and items plus an abundance of pointless features and useless details. You will be encapsulated by the unique Butt Slam mechanic a vague and abstract art style that puts Picasso to shame. Many types of weapons. The game currently features bow, spear, cannon, axe and harp. Butt Slam Put your booty to work in a fast-paced combat where your butt is your ultimate weapon. Colorful and varied progression The game features many unique items and boons to be explored and combined by the player to form their unique combat style. Waves of enemies Different enemies appear in different stages with great variety, some shoots thunder while some shoots thunder poop. AAA experience Although an Indie game studio, we wanted to create a game rivaling that of other triple A games; so we simply redefined the A in triple A. The game features A lot of pancakes, A lot of Money and A lot of fishes.",
