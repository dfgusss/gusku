    "About the game": "In this Marioid styled game you can help little cat Bobo. Jump on enemies, run, scratch and spit furballs to fight your way back home. Bobo feels completely powerless and struggles to get in shape at first, but he constantly learns new mechanics and abilities. - lovingly crafted Metroidvania with Jump´N´Run gameplay - more than 200 optional upgrades and keys - varied level design - atmospheric soundtrack - keyboard, ps4, xbox360 and series x controller support - free of ads or in app purchases - 5-20 hours of gameplay - if your pc has problems processing hd graphics press '3' on your keyboard. This activates the 30FPS-mode to improve performance. - Please keep in mind that this is no AAA game. It's the first game I ever worked on and it purposefully contains some unusual design-choices. So if you are not open minded this might not be for you.",
