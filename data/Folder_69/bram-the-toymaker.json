    "About the game": "A scary bedtime story or a horrid physical entity? The story goes that the toymaker is an undead figure who comes out at night leaving a toy on the children’s bedroom window to lure and capture them. Upon finding an old hidden journal, Blake discovers that a folktale passed through generations in his family might hold some dark secrets. He embarks on a journey to unravel what’s behind his ancestor's mysterious journal. Return to your family roots, deep into a long-forgotten isolated 18th-century village called Grimmville where time has stopped. Upon arriving at the abandoned manor, once you set foot inside suddenly you find yourself trapped. Equipped with a flashlight you must explore the rooms. Some of them are escape-room style. Your main objective is to look for clues in order to solve timed puzzles that will give you the necessary items to progress further and make your way out.",
