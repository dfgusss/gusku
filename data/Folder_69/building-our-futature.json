    "About the game": "Building our Futature is a dickgirl cheating game told from a third-person perspective where the player can choose what content they would like to see in the next in-game week. This way you can decide what type of scenes you'd like to avoid or what content to focus on. Depending on what order you play the game some scenes and dialogue may also change. It is a visual novel where you can make choices from all of the character's perspectives. You decide what sexual act the wife and dickgirl co-worker wil perform on their weekly meet-up. Both the order you play scenes in and the choices you make for the characters influence the content in future scenes. Choosing the type of sexual acts you like most will often add similar content later in the story. The story centers around a husband with a successful start-up company and his supporting wife . Although supportive his wife can get lonely during her husband's long work hours, so she suggests he hires his very first employee . The new employee turns out to be quite capable and after having met her boss' wife they become fast friends. The husband doesn't know about the secret between his employees legs, nor about her ulterior motives with his wife though... The wife, her name is Sarah Collins if no other name is chosen. She is a homemaker who supports her husband in every way she can but can't help but feel a bit lonely during his frequent absence. The co-worker, Zoe Hills is her name if no other name is chosen. She will happily give her boss a hand in his company, but would also like to give his busty wife a hand, or a third leg, while he spends his time away from home. The husband, Dan Collins is his name if no other name is chosen. He is a hard-working individual trying to give his wife the future she deserves. His hard work has paid of as he now runs his very own successful start-up company.",
