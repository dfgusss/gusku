The Paranormal investigation team got a call from Jun, the owner of the Kentucky house, with a request to investigate her property. She said that an Evil spirit followed her home from the cemetery which she visited a few weeks ago for attending a funeral of one of her close relatives who passed away recently. A day after she returned home from the graveyard the paranormal activities started to pick up. Every day, she experienced the various paranormal activities like seeing dark apparitions, furniture moving on their own, unexplained banging noises, disembodied growling and laughing sounds, and foul smell coming from the basement area.
