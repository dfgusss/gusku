Caterpilla is a simple riff on an arcade classic, released for the ZX Spectrum and Commodore VIC-20. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Gameplay The deadly Caterpilla makes its way down the screen, weaving back and forth. Shoot it before it reaches the bottom of the screen. You will also need to contend with mushrooms that block the way, and a fearsome spider that will lunge at you! This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
