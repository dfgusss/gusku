    "About the game": "In this game you grow your army of creatures to destroy the enemy. Creatures are groups of connected pieces. A move in this game is to copy a creature you control and paste it in a different position. The copy has to overlap the creature. So the size and shape determines the moves you can make. You gain control over creatures when this pattern, called a core, is part of that creature: You can play vs the AI or other players online. You can change the board size to play on a huge board and make more complex shapes. There are also puzzles where the enemy does not move but you have a limited number of moves to win. Items for special mode Bombs that and rotator guns for special levels.",
