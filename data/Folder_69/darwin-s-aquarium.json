    "About the game": "Darwin's Aquarium is a real-time fish breeding simulator. Build up a tank, start training and breeding your own fish to survive and thrive. Advance your breeding capabilities, improve your breeding grounds and unlock more valuable fish. You'll see plenty of unbelievable fish interaction: Fish that start hunting, fleeing, cooperating. Some might learn to farm algae, others might start to bait less harmful fish… who knows…? There is no limit to the interaction of the fish, and every evolution of species can bring new features. Make sure you select your fish carefully and only breed the fittest, so you can compete against the other fish. It's up to you and your fish to cooperate with other players or just defeat them - but be warned: Your fish are getting intelligent. They might have their own will soon! Note: The game is under active development and therefore the in-game graphics might look a little different from the screenshots. Plans: There is currently a building system for your room and house, a complex mutation system, a complete AI back-end to train fish and much more. That all aims toward build a best-possible simulation of real life evolution of fish, plus a lot of fun by doing so. Multiplayer(PVP and PVE), global trading (player to player), and cooperative training on the same fish will be added to the pre-release and should all be finished on the full release of the game. Furthermore, we expect the game to be of interest for educational or scientific purposes.",
