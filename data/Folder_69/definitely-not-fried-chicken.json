    "About the game": "Definitely Not Fried Chicken - ' For All Your Legitimate Fake Business Needs! ' Definitely Not Fried Chicken is a business management sim with a Twist! Grow your drugs trade through legitimate fronts by managing both sides of the business. Acquire new 'businesses', meet new clientele, develop more potent narcotics, make lots of money and leave a city in ruin! Set in a sunshine soaked city in the glamorous 80's, DNFC will test your entrepreneurial business skills. Build your drugs compound from the ground up, buy adjoining plots of land and expand. Design and lay out your complete production line and establish distribution routes. Fortify your compounds defences and make sure any ' overly-enthusiastic ' customers can't break in. Research and develop better strains of narcotics like marijuana, cocaine and methamphetamine. But simply making a great product is not enough, you need somewhere to sell it from! This is where your legitimate businesses come in - you'll need to build and manage these fronts, including selling legal goods to avoid detection, people gotta eat right? Run a chain of Fried Chicken stores or diversify your portfolio with other businesses. Different places have different people with different tastes . The backbone of every business is your workforce, the people who tirelessly carry out the tasks you assign them for minimum wage. A happy employee is a productive employee so it's important to make sure your staff have the basic necessities like washrooms and a place to eat. A well furnished break room is great for staff morale! And safety equipment will really help with staff turnover/mortality rates... Key features Start your drugs empire from the ground up, distributing marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine and other goods Balance the demanding tasks of managing both your illegal drugs trade and your “legit” businesses. Build and customise your drugs compound and business fronts.
