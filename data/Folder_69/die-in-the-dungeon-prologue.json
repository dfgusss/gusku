    "About the game": "This is the free version of Die in the Dungeon, a deck-building, turn-based roguelite where your deck is not made out of cards, but DICE ! In Die in the Dungeon, each dice represents a different action , from basic ones like attacking or healing, to boosting other dice or copying their abilities. Place dice on your board to unlock their powers , but be careful... not any place will do! The way you arrange your dice on the board will affect how good your turn is. Try to find the best combination while you upgrade your deck and collect new, stronger dice with unique abilities. Prologue Features Fight your way through 20+ floors with increasingly difficult encounters. With more than 10 different enemies, 2 bosses and many special events, you're getting a massive amount of content completely for free! Collect dice, make them stronger with special properties and craft the ultimate deck. All dice have base effects, which in turn can be combined with powerful modifiers to reduce their cost (Hollow) or make them stay longer on the board (Heavy), among many others! Replay and refine your strategy until you reach the final floor. Who is waiting for you at the end of the dungeon? Face familiar foes, learn the truth about this endless cycle and dare stepping even farther with a brand new game mode!",
