    "About the game": "A UNIQUE CARD GAME / BOARD GAME HYBRID Assemble your deck and play units and spells onto a board. A game that focuses on thoughtful decision-making and strategic positioning. All cards Unlocked All 800+ cards are unlocked, ready for you to use. Pick from 6 factions with distinguishing characteristics and different generals with unique Bloodbound spells. Highly Competitive Face people in Ladder 1v1 or draft a deck and fight in the gauntlet. Apart from Steam, Duelyst GG can be played on iPhone and Android all using the same account. Fight across platforms! Gameplay focused While Duelyst GG is fully functional on the gameplay front, we are still working on the UI and User experience. New features are added at a rapid pace. Soon we plan on releasing a roguelike deck builder for single player too. For those who played the original Duelyst: Duelyst GG was written from scratch based off the last patch. From there we have balanced and added new cards. This means 1 draw and Bloodbound Spells are in. But old bugs like broken Vale Ascension and annoying ddos decks are out.",
