    "About the game": "Dungeonrite is an old school First Person Dungeon Crawler with card game combat, deck building, and card collecting. Craft a powerful deck that will get you through expansive dungeons filled with enemies and loot. Escape intact and take your riches with you to rebuild a once forgotten town. Dungeonrite is inspired by the classic RPG's of the 90's. Begin with nothing but a deck of cards to defend yourself. Explore long forgotten dungeons with grid based movement. Collect gold and resources to help rebuild the abandoned town of Molden. Along the way, sell, buy, collect, and build your deck. That is, if you make it out of the dungeon alive in the first place. Features Deckbuilding: The key to success is crafting a strong deck from 100+ cards to choose from. Start with a deck that can get you by, but when you construct the Card Shop, you'll be able to buy, sell, and manage your deck how you see fit. Card Combat: You never know what or who you'll find lurking in the dungeons below. Play your cards carefully in challenging combat that can either end your run or make you rich. Card Collector: As you manage your deck, you'll be able to keep the cards you aren't using. Every single card is displayed to easily build your collection. Old School Dungeon Crawling: The grid based first person dungeon crawling is inspired by the classic RPGs from the 80's and 90's. Explore expansive dungeons as the game auto maps where you've been. It also shows how many areas are left unexplored. Loot: You'll find resources while exploring dungeons, and if you make it out alive, you'll keep what you found. If you die, you'll lose everything you found, even the gold. Rebuild The Town: The long abandoned town of Molden is yours to rebuild. Build a Blacksmith, Carpenter, Mason, Healer, Alchemist, and more. Refine resources, buy potions and elixirs, rebuild the town of Molden to its former glory. More to come through Early Access",
