    "About the game": "Dyestributor! From an aspiring duo of game developers comes an Indie puzzler that will make you bang your head against the wall! Starting with a simple concept of connecting two blocks, the game quickly expands and becomes a labyrinth of complex puzzles with branching solutions. Progress Through Themed Worlds Solve your way through an expanding list of thematic worlds, each with a special gameplay gimmick that sets them apart from one another. Find yourself gaining confidence in your puzzle-solving skills as you rack up Bronze, Silver, and Gold trophies throughout your playthrough! Wide Range of Blocks Refine your movements and navigate your way around obstacles as you master handling each block's unique mechanics, and expand your way of thinking when you come across an especially difficult level! (Yes, we swear they are all possible - we checked) Have Fun With Custom Levels! After a brain workout solving normal levels, give your brain a break and have some fun making devilish levels you can use to torture your friends or any unsuspecting strangers in the Steam Workshop. Then when you've mastered all of the game's levels, challenge yourself even further with the community's most complex levels! Thank you for checking out the games page!",
