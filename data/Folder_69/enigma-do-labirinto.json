A game for those who like riddles, and perhaps also for those who like snow cyclops and their love stories. The game brings a relaxed and calm atmosphere, in which the player, in control of the Abominable Cyclops of the snow, must explore a large labyrinth, looking for riddles scattered throughout its interior. Only after unraveling all the secrets of the labyrinth and finding all the answers to the riddles, the cyclops can go to the other side of the gates and leave the labyrinth. The game has several puzzles of different difficulty levels. Are you able to find the answer to all of them? Play and come find out! The whole game was made by a single person, no cakewalk. Just a lot of hard work and dedication. Made in Brazil.",
