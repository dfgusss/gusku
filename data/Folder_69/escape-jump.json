    "About the game": "Do you want to suck the joy out of your day? This is the perfect game for you. For those who enjoy a challenge and are willing to put their sanity on the line for that fleeting sense of achievement. Punish yourself and everyone you love with this fun 1-bit platformer. You are woken up at the bottom of a strange tower by a cute fairy. You don't know how you got there, the only thing you know is that there's only one way to go, up. Help Vani and yourself escape the damned tower and try to keep your sanity in the process. A cute companion Vani will be with you through thick and thin, encouraging you every step of the way. We wouldn't want you to be alone. Her sweet voice and quirky personality are sure to lighten up your journey. A lot of platform types for you to fall from Each platform was carefully designed to extract as much suffering as possible from the soul of the players. That suffering is then processed into an ambrosia type liquid that we sell to the disciples of Hell, so we can afford all kinds of fun stuff like nuclear waste, brussels sprouts and jet skis. Two game difficulties Really difficult: with checkpoints to save your progress. For those that refuse to completely give their souls away to a small game company. Really effing difficult: no checkpoints or save spots. You fall, you start over. This way lies madness.",
