    "About the game": "Originally released in 1984 for home microcomputers, this arcade-style game from the legendary Ocean Software saw players take on the role of Eddie and his friend Percy Penguin. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version of the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases of the game. Gameplay Rescue Percy Penguin from the clutches of the fearsome polar bear Growler (in this first level the gameplay differs in the two versions of the game - the ZX Spectrum version has you dodging ice holes and polar bears that criss cross the screen, the Commodore 64 version has you jumping over snowballs as you climb up the level towards your goal). Then, Percy must defend himself against deadly Snowbugs, pushing sliding ice blocks for protection. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
