    "About the game": "Lead the charge in establishing a colony on Mars in this turn-based strategy game with a nostalgic look but fresh gameplay. Use specialized tools to terraform the planet, build residential areas for your colonizers, and construct resource-producing factories in an effort to become a self-sustaining society. BUILD A COLONY Create a viable habitat for your settlers by building water pumps, establishing farms on fertile ground, harnessing the power of the sun, and mining for precious minerals. Make sure to plan carefully before building. The position of each building will provide additional bonuses based on their placement. For example, placing a wind turbine near mountains will provide an increase in electricity output. GO UNDERGROUND In case you run out of space on the surface or are in need of further resources, you can always choose to expand below. Utilize terraforming tools to dig underground and uncover new areas for expansion, discover artifacts, and harness rare minerals. The more resources you collect, the more your colonists will prosper. TERRAFORMING SYSTEM Use a turn to select a terraforming kit and shape the landscape to your colony’s advantage. Need a water source? Place a water drop tile into a canyon and watch the surrounding flat land become fertile. Not enough resources? Create new mineral deposits or simply expand pre-existing ones. Terraforming tiles have preset shapes, so be careful when configuring where to place them! You may end up with ice if you place a water drop tile on flat ground instead of a canyon. Be wise in your choices and always plan two steps ahead. REPLAYABILITY Each playthrough a new map will be procedurally generated and will provide fresh challenges to overcome. The same applies to terraforming patterns that you are getting, trading proposals, and even weather conditions.",
