    "About the game": "A Spanish language version of Find the Whales, a free-to-play educational game about ocean conservation. Players choose a location from the simulated globe. Game features several areas and habitats in the Mesoamerican Reef region of Honduras, Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. Players then travel by boat to each place and try and find local, endangered species such as the Rainbow parrotfish and Whale shark. They can take photos of these species and themselves exploring, to put in their simulated album. Local conservation non-player characters teach the players about the conservation work being done and ask players to complete simulated conservation quests. For doing these, players get points, which they use to exchange for tools in the simulated store. Players also get points for finding species. They can also collect information cards about each species. The more times they find each species, the more content is added to these cards: photos, videos, and text.",
