    "About the game": "Find the Whales is a free-to-play educational game for all ages about ocean conservation. Players travel to simulated places on the globe to find whales, fish, and other marine animals. They also do simulated conservation quests to help the animals. The locations featured are Hawaii and the Mesoamerican Reef. In this 2D side-scroller, players walk, snorkel, and SCUBA dive to find crabs, whales, fish, dolphins and other animals. Quests include planting mangrove seedlings, stopping illegal fishing, slowing down speeding boats, cleaning polluted water, farming seaweed and listening for whales with a hydrophone. Players collect points for finding species. They can also take photos to store in the simulated photo album. Points are used to purchase quest-related tools in the simulated stores at each location. Players also collect information cards. The more times they find the same species, the more information is added to these cards - text, photos and videos about these species.",
