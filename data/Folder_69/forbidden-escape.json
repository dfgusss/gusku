    "About the game": "This game requires a controller. We are in the middle of the ocean. On a tanker kept secret from the rest of the world, scientists experiment on child guinea pigs to harness the supernatural effects of an artifact found at the bottom of the sea. After nearly a decade of research, something goes wrong and the artifact explodes, spreading an encroaching corruption throughout the entire ship and infecting all of its passengers. You play as Riley, a young guinea pig who seems to be the only one to have survived the infection. Escape the tanker and discover the new powers that lie dormant within you. This original product was entirely developed by nearly thirty students of the 2021-2022 cohort of the Campus ADN, a public videogame school in downtown Montreal, as part of a 15-week end-of-study production project under the supervision of around ten industry professionals. Forbidden Escape is a 3rd person puzzle-solving and combat game that mixes supernatural clashes and platforming. Explore the various levels of Exodus in linear levels and follow Riley's interesting encounter with Inspeca, the Alien Artifact, as she attempts to escape the only home she has ever known. Characteristics Embark on this supernatural adventure - escape from a secret ship, sinking in the middle of the ocean, while fending off any danger that crosses your path. Platforming - test your agility through perilous paths that will put your skills to the test. Puzzle solving - exercise your brain with challenging and interesting puzzles that force you to use all the resources at your disposal. Brutal Combat - unlock new supernatural abilities to aid you in battles against humans now transformed by the corruption of the artifact. Atmosphere and touching narration - the loneliness seems heavy in this sinking ship as the artifact quietly takes possession of what was once your only home. Find your changed friends and try to free them from this unprecedented infection.",
