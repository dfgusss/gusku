    "About the game": "Forest Fire is a roguelite destruction game with a simple objective: Burn as much as possible. This may or may not include; trees, animals, housing, and those pesky humans. Every pixel is physically simulated and will spread your flame far and wide. Don’t think you’ll burn unopposed. Mother nature has sent in a bullet-hell array of rain clouds and other obstacles to put an end to your destruction fest. Your flame must weave through the storm to survive. Firefighting helicopters, planes, and little firemen will also be out to get you. The more you burn their buildings the more pissed off they get. This is a roguelite game so each run is different. However, we still maintain a sense of progression with persistent level up points. This means you get stronger, even if you die 5000 times. Forest Fires aren’t just limited to trees… light whole groups of people on fire, explode helicopters out of the sky, and burn famous monuments. Your destruction has no boundaries and is unimpeded by morality. The forest is vast and unending, with a myriad of secrets hidden within her. Features -5 unique levels -Roguelite style perma-death -Dozens of painful bullet hell patterns -Unlockables and persistent level-up system -Dozens of secrets; characters, monuments, and oddities -Achievements and leaderboards ...And all this for less than the price of a burrito! Are you ready to burn?",
