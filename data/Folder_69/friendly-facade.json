    "About the game": "Friendly Facade is a visual novel with point and click mini-games incorporated into key story moments to immerse the player in the experience. The game highlights the difficult decisions that must be made and how those decisions can have rippling effects on the other characters in this story. Every character has a deep and complex backstory, ideals, and motivations that intersect and collide with each other to form a rich, nuanced story where not everyone is able to get a happy ending. Inside the peaceful confines of the Isolated Society Study, competition, manipulation, and betrayal run rampant, and this is before the Golding Foundation intervenes, changing the rules of the game, and the fates of those 16 individuals trapped within it, forever... Can you solve the mystery of the Golding Foundation, and dispel the facades that all 16 characters in this story use to mask their deepest, darkest secrets? Right now the first chapter is available to play.",
