Story A lone girl stands abandoned on a broken star. With the star deprived of its power, she can neither use it to escape nor inform others of her plight. However, there exists a point on this star that intersects with another world. The player, by standing on this convergence point and wearing the Otherworld-Viewing Device (VR unit), can enter the parallel world and communicate with the girl. Together, they cooperate to solve the puzzle of restoring the star's power so she may be able to leave. Character Game Concept Although sight is highly intuitive in VR, the same cannot be said for most other aspects, leading to irritation from clumsy controls. We designed this game around directing a character through glances to circumvent this and change that annoyance into a game element. How to play. Match the red dot in the center of the screen to the object you are interested in, and its outline will be circled. The girl will then examine and move the object for the player. Through trial and error, you can solve the mystery and lead the girl to escape from the planet. Operation. 　Can be played with HMD only, no controller.
