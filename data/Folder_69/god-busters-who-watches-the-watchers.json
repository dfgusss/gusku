    "About the game": "In a world where gods and saints are common place one task force must watch over them. These are their stories. Equal parts ghost busters, equal parts crime thriller. God Busters is a classic detective style visual novel with a paranormal twist. Follow three God Busters agents as they try and solve mysteries all throughout their city in a format inspired by classic tv shows. It's a simple visual novel where your choices just net you more lore rather then complex endings (for now) so don't worry to hard about trying to find everything. God Busters is filled to the brim with inspirations from many things ; Movies, tv shows, music. It wears it's inspirations on it's sleeve to (hopefully) try and make something great with them.",
