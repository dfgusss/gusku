    "About the game": "Welcome to Detroit. Gang violence has become an epidemic, forcing all civilians and police to leave the city. All that remains are soldiers of the Bloods and Crips. The city has become an abandoned battlefield where gangs engage in large scale firefights known as 'Hood Warfare'. Gangs will fight whenever and wherever across the city. Hood Warfare features classic FPS gameplay, reminiscent of the golden age of PC FPS games from the early 2000s. Hood Warfare's Gamemodes Include: Gang Warfare: A round-based mode where your team will clash in the streets of large maps with large teams. Each player only gets one life per round. Come up with strategy's with your team to win rounds. Turf War. A gamemode where gangs fight for control of turf surrounding a map. Gangs will get points for every piece of turf they own. Eventually, the gang with the most turf points will win. Chaos. Every man for himself. There is no loyalty to a gang in this mode. Kill or be killed to win. Gangbang: Classic Bloods vs Crips firefight with the most points win. 3 Gang mode variants: Tired Of 2 teams? Switch it up with three. These modes feature the Bloods vs Crips vs Serpents, a new gang. Hood Warfare features online play, however offline play is also supported with bots. Bots can also fill private or public lobby's if the host chooses to enable them.
