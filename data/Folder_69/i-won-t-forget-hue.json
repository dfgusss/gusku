Disorganized and alone, a woman finds herself crafting new glasses in order to view her own home through a different lens. Throughout the home, you will go searching for new and different coloured lenses, while the house seems to be alive and ever-changing around you. You have the ability to craft new glasses, making you able to see even more of the seemingly multi-coloured house. During your journey through the house, you will hear many noises that seem impossible to explain. But these noises have a cause, only you can’t see them, yet. But once you see them using the correct glasses, they will see you too. Chasing you down the hallways, not letting you have any rest in this altering house. Gameplay: In I Won’t Forget Hue, you will be walking around the narrow hallways and rooms of a dark, old house. But while you explore this mansion, you find that you might not be alone. Different glasses cause the house around you to change. Once the evil finds you looking around, it will chase you all over. You must find a way to use the colours to your advantage, to find new parts and figure out what how to hide from the evil. All while you try to figure out what happened to the rest of your family.
