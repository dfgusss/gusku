    "About the game": "In Samurai Bushido tradition, 'Iaijutsu' is the technique of quickly drawing your blade for lethal effect. Precision, patience and timing are key to this form. So too is it the key to besting your foes in this rooftop hopping action platformer. Play as the nameless ronin as you seek to liberate your clan from its corrupt usurpers. Your opponents will be tough and will block any careless attacks you may make, so pay close attention to their moves and choose when you draw your blade carefully. - Journey through two levels featuring a variety of beautiful pixel art environments - Encounter several combinations of enemies with varying abilities - Face off one on one against two tough bosses - Iaijutsu features an original soundtrack by samurai descendant Jeffrey Daijiro Taylor featuring two intense songs for Taiko drums. Controls : Move: A and D Strike: J Jump: Space Dash Attack: Jump + Strike, use WASD to control direction of dash",
