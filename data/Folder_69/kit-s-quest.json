The flooded shrine to a water serpent? An enchanted metalworks factory? You name it! COLLECT! Scavenge everything you can get your paws on to help make headway on your quest! Dregnor has placed magical barriers throughout the land… Look for dragon teeth and use their magic to break through! Friendly birds might be willing to lend you a hand (or wing)… especially after you bribe them with some gathered berries ! Queen Nelli has lost her Golden Mushrooms ! Find them and Her Majesty may reward you handsomely! OVERCOME CHALLENGES!

Meet and befriend a marathoning parrot, a skittish bunny, a world-famous stork archaeologist, and many more allies who will help you on your way! FIND… FOES? As if Dregnor wasn’t bad enough by himself, his alliance with the deadly spiders who roam the land is sure to cause trouble. If you find yourself going up against a crystalline arachnid at least twenty times your size (and probably in a bad mood), just remember… Vixie’s counting on you! THE RIGHT CHALLENGE FOR EVERYONE! With several difficulty options , Kit’s Quest can be enjoyed by beginners and 3D platforming veterans alike! There’s also a dedicated Speedrunning mode for those who like to go fast.
