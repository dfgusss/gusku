    "About the game": "●The Twins, the Parents, and the Fish-Head Cult● A boy with one eye, and a boy with one arm. A broken household. An evil cult with a mysterious faith. A series of horrifying tragedies. But what dark fate connects these things? ●A Fresh Visual Experience with a Unique Art Style● Life Gallery utilizes a pen-and-ink drawing style and contains more than 50 illustrations, each one immersing the player in the frightening and uncanny world of the story. ●Easy to Control, Tricky to Solve● Each puzzle in Life Gallery is hidden inside an illustration. The key to solving each one lies in manipulating the objects within the illustrations to progress the plot and reveal the truth about the characters--relying not just on the player’s intelligence, but on their imagination and sensitivity to the illustrations and the story. ●Classic Works of Art Turned into Nightmares● Classic paintings such as the Mona Lisa and Dance form the basis for multiple levels within the game, transforming these famous works of art into surreal and nightmarish scenarios with which the player can interact.",
