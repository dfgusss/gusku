    "About the game": "Explore new worlds in Lollypop, the colorful action platformer originally released in 1994 by legendary publisher Rainbow Arts! In this adventure, you’ll play as Lolly, a windup doll that mysteriously comes to life with one goal – to free the world from the evil clutches of Sugarbaby, who is tormenting the land with hordes of quirky enemies. Along Lolly’s journey, you’ll travel through 8 unique worlds – each one with its own distinct vibe and sound. Fight through obstacles and enemies all attempting to stop Lolly’s crucial rescue mission! Attack enemies and gain treasure by throwing lollipops, and increase health and points by consuming a variety of candies. Build up your candy arsenal by collecting extra abilities and power-ups along the way to prepare yourself for boss battles! In this side-scrolling action platformer, energetic gameplay is sweetened with a vibrant yet ominous soundtrack and highly-detailed environments that fill the game’s landscapes.",
