    "About the game": "It was meant to be a quick run to the pharmacy just before the snowstorm got too bad. After a car accident blocks the road though, Mitch is forced to take a detour. With the choice between freezing out in the cold or using the local library's payphone to call for help, Mitch enters into a place that only resembles the warm place from childhood in surface appearance. Shh... There's more than one reason to keep quiet here... Gameplay Lost Cartridge - Cold Read has you control Mitch as he explores the dark parody of his hometown's library. Tasks required in order to escape can be completed in a variety of different orders, letting you tackle different problems at your own pace in this retro-inspired horror adventure game. Among the library's various death traps, dangerous monsters stalk the shelves, looking for intruders. Unfortunately for you, that is exactly how they see you. There is no way to defend yourself from these creatures, requiring you to make note of any possible hiding places.",
