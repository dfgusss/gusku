    "About the game": "'Lunar Mirror' It is a horror suspense decryption game with the theme of Cthulhu in the research institute. Nishimura Qiren's girlfriend mysteriously disappeared on campus. With the help of his friends, Qiren discovered that the disappearance of his girlfriend was linked to the school's weird clubs that are keen on organizing 'late night fellowship'. As the investigation deepened, strange events happened one after another，The huge conspiracy behind it also slowly surfaced... Why do school girls disappear one after another? Why are boys so keen on the club's midnight activities? What happened ten years ago? What is the mysterious organization plotting on the ground? All these unknowns require you to find the answer... Game Features The theme of this game combines Cthulhu and the campus theme, making the game plot not only the mystery of Cthulhu but also the relaxation of the campus theme Throughout the game, we emphasize that players gradually enter the inextricable horror, so whether it is the plot or the scene picture, it will gradually collapse, allowing players to gradually bring them into the rich and mysterious world of the mirror of the moon The game uses an alternate day and night mode to play the game, looking for clues to promote the plot during the day, and exploring and discovering the truth at night. While it can greatly enrich the game world view, it can also give players some time to breathe in the horror atmosphere This game uses mental value to represent the state of the protagonist. In addition to reducing the damage you encounter again, the mental value may also change due to your choice of the plot. At the same time, the spiritual value is the character's field of vision.",
