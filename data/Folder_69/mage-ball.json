    "Name": "Mage Ball",
    "Release date": "Jan 29, 2023",
    "About the game": "The inspiration for the creation of 'Mage Ball' are classic arcade games from the 90s available on 8 and 16-bit home computers in which the player controlled balls, spheres and other oval objects. Stylistically and story-wise, I wanted to reflect the spirit of fantasy/sci-fi movies and books that I was the recipient of in my youth. Game: We control the eye of a magician who explores alternative dimensions. We jump on platforms, roll, collect magic potions, avoid traps and chasms. The main goal is to collect all 'Knowledge nodes' in current dimension, which allows us to open a portal to the next one. In further stages we will have to confront the passage of time.",
