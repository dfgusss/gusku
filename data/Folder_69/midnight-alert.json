A promising new horror FPS franchise has arrived. A priest decided to promote a ritual that would open the gates of hell and bring chaos; the problem is, his plan worked, and now we must fight for our lives in this new world where creatures and humans cannot coexist. Creatures everywhere Keep an eye out because the creatures could appear from any direction. Prepare you guns and protect yourself Horror Atmosphere Getting a gun to protect yourself from their creatures doesn't mean you won't have to worry about the horrors that surround you. The game was designed to have a dark atmosphere and to provide a good horror gaming experience. Even these creatures can give you a scare now and then. Intense gameplay and boss fights Throughout the game, you must battle multiple creatures as well as a challenging boss. Prepare yourself for anything.
