    "About the game": "Become a dandelion seed and soar to the sky. Enjoy nature by listening to beautiful music. Fly farther and higher by interacting with nature. Heal your weary heart by playing Nature. Relaxing game Nature can be played with only one button. (Keyboard Space Key or A Button on Controller) When you press the button dandelion will fly up or release the button dandelion will fly down. With this gesture, interact with various creatures in nature and fly further and higher. There is no game over in Nature. Just fly through the sky with beautiful music. When Flower (a force that flies up in the sky) reaches zero, it will fall to the ground, but it will bloom there and fly back.",
