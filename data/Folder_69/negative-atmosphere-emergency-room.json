    "About the game": "Negative Atmosphere: Emergency Room is a first person, cinematic medical horror experience dedicated to precision, tension and trauma. As the Chief Medical Officer on the TRH Rusanov, Samuel Edwards must triage, examine and operate on his crew-mates, as disaster builds and shady figures set the events in motion that will eventually lead to Negative Atmosphere. / Witness the Rusanov’s descent into madness first-hand, as you struggle to keep everyone alive with the limited resources you have at your disposal. As Chief Medical Officer of the Rusanov and an experienced surgeon, Edwards has a confident, in-depth understanding of everything from drugs to scalpels. During the course of Negative Atmosphere: Emergency Room, all the patients coming into the OR will be your responsibility and although Edwards will be there to support you, you will have to learn quickly in order to get your crew-mates through the rougher parts. Your wit and observation skills are key to their survival. Edwards has sworn a Hippocratic oath. This means that morality is not just about what you want as a player, as every decision will have an effect on Edwards. You have every freedom to set your own priorities during medical procedures, but the outcome might be different to what you were hoping for. Your patients live or die by your decisions and Edwards and his team will suffer the consequences of those losses. With extensive accessibility options all - except the most faint of heart- will be able to experience the horrors Negative Atmosphere: Emergency Room has to offer, be the blood green, purple or otherwise discoloured. In addition the episodes will be free for the foreseeable future, removing any barrier to entry and making it possible for everyone to delve into the universe of Negative Atmosphere. Control Rebinding Dyslexia Font Configurable Subtitles Toggle / Hold options There is no bringing back the dead. There is no do-over in life. If you lose a patient, you have to move on and live with what has happened. The crew will have to cope with losing one of their own and you will have to adjust for future operations, so take care. You only get one chance per playthrough to make things right.",
