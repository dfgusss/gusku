It is set in New Devon in the year 2169 , a futuristic city in the hands of large corporations. To maintain power over the city and its population, corporations heavily rely on gathering and stealing data that can give them the edge over their competitors. Snatchers are the perfect agents for the job. One of these corporations, the Zora, has a very talented Snatcher named Colden, the main character that the player will follow throughout Neon Noir. Features Unique art style with a monochromatic palette. '50s Noir films black and white colliding with cyberpunk's brights neons Compelling crime stories involving new technologies and moral dilemmas Neuralink mode which allows the player to retrieve data Investigation mode which challenges the player to find clues in a crime scene Shooting mode which puts the player in the middle of gun fights against humans or AI Episodes The game is aimed at being episode based, meaning that the first build will include Episode 1: Gemini (roughly 40 minutes long). Each episode will be standalone and it will always focus on Colden and his cases within New Devon. From here onwards, we are planning to release each additional episode as a DLC. As we are also gamers, we understand the concern of players on additional content and excessively high prices, thus we want to assure you that each episode will be adequately priced.",
