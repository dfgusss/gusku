    "About the game": "FEATURES A visual novel about a hospital where all the nurses are the worst Full Japanese voice acting by seasoned professionals SUMMARY Yamada falls into the clutches of the “OG Three,” a triple threat of veteran nurses! ■Meet the sinister trio that even the other nurses fear! “Begrudging Nurse” Tachibana, “Insidious Nurse” Kurokawa, “Violent Nurse” Yamaguchi, and “Demotivational Nurse” Hiramatsu. Just like the rumors said, this hospital’s got nothing but nurses with the worst personalities. I had no idea there could be anybody worse than them! These three aren't just nasty… They’re pure evil. Some are obsessive, some wicked, and others unpredictable. They're the absolute worst—and that's what makes them the best! ■A Story That’s Gaining Speed! Man, all I did was break some bones and get hospitalized. And yet everyone treats me like the scum of the earth! Plus, recently things here have been feeling off. Like there’s a dark cloud hanging over you no matter where you go… The basic gameplay loop is that these awful nurses give main character Yamada a hard time, over and over again. But they're very creative, so it never gets stale—and this time, the story that’s been waiting in the wings is finally taking center stage. CHARACTERS “Obsessive Nurse” Numajiri Voice: Kazuha One of the veteran nurses that make up the “OG Three” at the hospital I’m in. Out of all the other nurses here, I’m scared of her the most. Since the day she became my primary nurse, she has been incessantly whispering horrible things into my ear. And the more I show it's getting to me, the happier she gets. I really wish she would leave me alone. However, Numajiri seems to like me or something because whether I’m sleeping or going to the convenience store, she always follows me around. “Black-Hearted Nurse” Kiritani Voice: Ren Toyotaka Another member of the “OG Three.” When Yamaguchi told me my primary nurse for this week would be Kiritani, she looked at me like she was pitying me. I heard that Kiritani is a former delinquent who was feared by everyone in her hometown… But I’m not gonna trust the rumors! After all, Kiritani seems nice, inside and out. Maybe a bit frail-looking, but a real beauty with presence. Calling someone like that a former delinquent has got to be some kind of terrible joke. She actually treats me in the nicest way possible… “Psychopathic Nurse” Tendo Voice: Miru Tendo is the last of the “OG Three.” She’s an eccentric person who’s always laughing. Is she always in a really good mood, or is she just completely cracked...? I think that rather than seeing me as a patient that needs assistance, she sees me more as a rarity and thus a friend worth playing with... or maybe a toy? Any way you slice it, she’s a very dangerous person with no common sense. But since she’s the daughter of the head nurse who basically runs this hospital, no one can tell her off. Will I make it to my discharge date safely?",
