    "About the game": "A game based on J.R.R. Tolkien's novel The Lord of the Rings. A variant 'Metroidvania' with elements of survival and crafting. An old shadow fantasy game about what would have happened if a sub-mountain creature had stayed alive. It fell into a volcano, but before it died it managed to put a magic ring on its finger. The ring sensed its doom and transported it to a vast cavern far to the east. To the dungeon of an ancient god, an associate of the dark lord. It took too much strength and the ring broke off 15 pieces, and now it's up to him to collect them and rebuild the ring. The main goal of the game, collect the shards of all 15 rings and rebuild the forge of the ancient god. Each collected shard gives the creature a new ability. The game includes shards of fire, stench, filth, time, thunder, etc. Each shard gives the creature a unique ability and helps it advance and learn about the world and influence its enemies. Survival; A creature can die from starvation, cold, or drowning. In order not to freeze the player will need to seek heat sources from time to time. Crafting; You can construct different types of buildings with different materials, walls, bridges, traps, towers and the ingredients to build them. Traps and walls are needed to repel attacks by scary creatures. The Ring survived, which means that the Dark Lord survived, even though he was disembodied. His dark will drive his subjects to the ancient god's abode to take away the shards from the creature. Each shard has its own cave, thematic (shards are lying in assorted that forces the player to be resourceful). All caves are different, with different enemies, vegetation and lighting. Central cave, cave swamps, big underground lake, goblin cave and others. Also in the game there is an element of bonus. In the caves there are 9 masks hidden. Each mask gives a permanent effect. For example fireman mask protects against fire, diver mask allows you to breathe underwater, demon mask destroys enemies, and so on.",
