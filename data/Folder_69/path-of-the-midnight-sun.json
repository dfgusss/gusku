Sixty years ago, these lands bore witness to the arrival of an immortal being known as the Demon King. Tormented and driven to desperation, scholars of the land fell upon a controversial solution. The Demon’s soul would be pulled from His body, and sealed within a human. These custodians of the soul are simply known as “Vassals”. Following 21 years of peace, a complacency has settled in around Arvium. However, when the newest Vassal, Lady Faratras Hoikade, murders her own soldiers in cold blood, the continent must reckon with the possibility that this is only the beginning of a journey filled with tears and blood; doubt and self-acceptance.",
