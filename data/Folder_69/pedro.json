    "About the game": "Originally released in 1984 for home microcomputers, this cartoony arcade game from Imagine saw players take on the role of the titular Pedro, a frustrated gardener trying desperately to protect his precious flower garden from invading animals. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version of the ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases of the game. Gameplay Collect bricks and compost to block the path of the invading animals, and seeds to replant any flowers that get eaten. Stomp on animals to defeat them. Survive for the whole of the timer, or defeat all the animals, to move to the next level. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
