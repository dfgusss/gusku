    "Release date": "Jan 20, 2023",
    "About the game": "Mouse &amp; Keyboard is supported but this game is best experienced with a Gamepad. Become a Champion Fight your way to the top through 3 championships from Amateur to Pro, each featuring unique and challenging opponents. Is This Game For YOU? Punch A Bunch focuses on you learning the game mechanics to improve your skills rather than relying on “leveling up” or “attribute points”. The controls are uniquely designed to give a fresh experience. Most people start off pretty rough, the game is designed to give you great satisfaction through honing your skills and mastering the controls. You have everything you need to become a champion right away, the question is, are you up for the challenge? YES Unique controls giving you full control but takes practice to master. Quick tutorial to get you started on your boxing journey. 100% physics-based. Lots of additional challenges to keep completionists coming back for more. Play against friends in Local Multiplayer (compatible with Steam Remote Play). 100+ unlockable items to customize your character with. Classic “Just One More Try” experience. BUT NO skill-points or leveling, all you need is practice, skill and patience. NOT a casual game, if you don’t like a challenge, keep looking! NO online multiplayer (maybe in the future). NOT a button-mashing game. Note from The Developer This game was made entirely by one person, me (hello I’m Pontus). I spent a little over 2 years creating this game. Personally, I'm a fan of games that are initially really difficult but then become almost easy once you really get the hang of it. It is in this vain I designed Punch A Bunch. If you decide to purchase a copy, I salute and thank you, I hope that you'll enjoy this little game I created. And should you find yourself frustrated, remember, never don't give up. Note: At least one gamepad is required in order to play local multiplayer.",
