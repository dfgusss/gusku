    "About the game": "[Px2d] is a frame animation editor specially designed for 2d pixel character animation. Support 4-direction character production. Three advantages of [Px2d]. Advantages 1. You can create your own characters without painting Different from traditional pixel painting tools, you should first draw characters yourself, and then make character animation. In [Px2d], you don't need to paint, and you don't need any painting experience. You can create your own character. [Px2d] Relying on the huge material library, there are a lot of materials for users to choose from. Just choose the materials you like, and you can create your own role. Select the component style of the head Select the component style of the body Select the component style of the weapon Customize your role as you like. Support importing user-defined materials In addition to the materials in the material library, [Px2d] also supports users to import their own materials for animation. Advantages 2. Say goodbye to a single template and create unlimited possibilities Different from the traditional paper doll system, there is only one single fixed action template. Because the action is fixed and cannot be adjusted, it cannot meet our demand for action. [Px2d] adopts the role body component mode. Every part of a character's body is a component. It can be adjusted at will. In this way, we can meet the needs of our actions to the greatest extent. If you want to do something, you can do it yourself. You can customize your own actions according to different action requirements. In order to provide maximum convenience for everyone. [Px2d] also supports the action library. Some basic actions, such as standby action, walking action, attack action, death action, etc. Are included in the action library. Users can omit animation production and directly import the actions in the action library for direct use. (The action library is still being prepared and will be updated later.) Advantages 3. One click export, greatly improving efficiency [Px2d] Support one click to export png format pictures. No matter you have made any changes to the character style or the character action, you can export the resource with one click.",
