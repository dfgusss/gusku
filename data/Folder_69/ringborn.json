    "About the game": "Ringborn is a story-driven top-down RPG set in a medieval world full of choice and consequence. In Ringborn, you play as Idas, the son of a woodcutter tasked with rescuing your father in a world filled with unbridled greed, broken oaths and flawed beauty. Inspired by classical RPGs of old and medieval slashers of new, Ringborn combines action combat with interactive storytelling and dialogue to create a truly unique experience. Story Fight in the pits of the Ivory Theatre for glory and honour. You aren’t the chosen one, you aren’t a demi-god imbued with supreme power over all. You’re the son of a woodcutter, trying to survive forces beyond your control. There is no beam in the sky, no world-ending plot. This is a medieval story, filled with medieval problems. World Journey through rugged landscapes of snow, desert, mountains, forests and plains to find resources that will aid your quest. Combat With a deep combat system that rewards skill and strategy, you'll need to master the art of combat in order to emerge victorious. Combine slashes, parries and kicks to defeat your opponents. With over one hundred pieces of weapons and armour, you will have an abundance of choice. Skills As the son of a woodcutter, you naturally have developed the skill of harvesting. Learn crafting and combat to expand your options. Temper these skills to claw control back into your world. Harvesting Chop wood and mine rock. Increase your skill to harvest advanced materials. Crafting Create weapons and armour from your harvested materials. This will provide you with everything you need to defeat your foes in the arena. Characters Meet a varied cast of characters that form part of the world. Pay close attention to your choices as they affect how others treat you and how the story unfolds. Next Generation Built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5. Rendered using Lumen.",
