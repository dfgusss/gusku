    "About the game": "Scrapyard Arena is an attempt in mashing together various styles of mechanics and camera angles to obtain a diverse adventure experience. The result is a top down hack and slash that forces you to learn enemies attack pattern in order to get every ability from a small talent tree update system. This game offers 40/60 minutes of gameplay but you can always try to unlock every achievement or get a new highscore in the ENDLESS MODE. Scrapyard Arena is my first project and I'm already thankful for getting it on Steam, buying it means supporting my journey as a solo indie developer and that's immensely appreciated. If people like the mechanics, the environment or the style I'm gonna expand this game with free updates, adding brand new levels, enemies and power up, elseways I'll start working on my next project. Thanks for being here",
