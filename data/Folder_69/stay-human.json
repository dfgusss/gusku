You will need to collect weapons, ammo, food and medical supplies to survive the journey. There will be powerful zombie bosses and their minions in your way. Stay Human is hex based strategy game designed by the legendary Greek game design guru Mike Georgiou. Featuring a turn based tactical dice combat system, distinct zombie opponents, and dozens of unique weapons, ammunition, food and medical supplies. Play a random hero, or select from dozens of contrasting hero's with varying survival skills.

Escape the city... but most importantly... Stay Human!",
