    "About the game": "What's next? A play mode with a day-night cycle where players can survive the enemy at night and build defenses during the day. A marketplace that can share creations between players, as small as a chair, as large as an extensive landscape. Better tools with copy, paste, and rotate features that makes creating big architectures even faster. What is System Terminal? System Terminal is a user-generated content platform allowing users to easily create, share and monetize virtual environments and AR decorations. We planned two apps, one is this Virtual Planet Builder, and another is the AR Engine in development. All creations will eventually be compatible with computers and the majority of Mixed-reality Headsets. Fun and Easy World Building System Terminal: Virtual Planet Builder is a sandbox engine that allows you to build your dream world with blocks. It is fun and easy, unlike a game engine, but it can create things at the game engine level. Come here to build your worldview! Smaller Blocks, More Creativity A state-of-the-art 3D algorithm can achieve real-time editing of much smaller blocks, giving you more creative freedom. Unlike other world-building engines, you can use our tool to shape anything you want from scratch. Created By Players for Players We are dedicated to building virtual experiences that focus on the players' interests, a world created by players and for players, where all are welcome to play and create.
