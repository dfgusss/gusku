    "About the game": "Key Features TADO features a large shared online world with solo and group content along with third-person action combat. TADO has classless progression system, as you level you gain skill points you can spend to gain access to a wide variety of different skills. Along with combat you can, craft, fish gather and explore both land and sea, and you can do it all together. Whilst traditional experienced based levelling is important in TADO, you are free to invest the experience you earn in any of the many available statistics giving your character access to different skills, equipment and crafting opportunities. Want to wield a great sword and cast dark magic? Specialize in the Occult along with Great Weapon fighting and crush your enemies with your power. Perhaps you're more the protector, preferring to keep their friends safe with your heavy armour and shield? Invest your skills into the Protection and Heavy Armour and keep your body between your enemies and those that would harm your friends. Maybe you don't know what you want to be and you just found a rare skill gem that allows you to shapeshift into a great bear to crush your enemies? Well spend your saved points in Druidism , equip your new ability and get right to it! TADO also offers other more peaceful ways to earn coin and experience including transporting goods, gathering, crafting or even fishing. TADO features a naval system allowing you to acquire ships and sail the world (with a crew of friends if you have one!) be you a trader buying and selling goods to earn that extra coin or a mighty hunter seeking rare sea creatures for the epic treasures. Playing through the story will see you setup with your first ship and sailing between various locations in the world in no time. PvP experiences are available and optional , including event based activities you can sign up for and compete for valuable rewards. TADO isn’t another aimless open world game that just drops you in the open and sends you about your business, there is a core story which you can play through at your own pace, introducing you into the world and setting you up as an adventurer before you make your own mark on the world. TADO features plenty of solo-friendly content along with some harder dungeons and zones which will require you to bring your party or guild to overcome. TADO isn’t a huge high budget game with all the edges shaven off in the name of homogeneous balance or maximum engagement, it’s not trying to be. If you’re looking for a place to chill out exploring, crafting rare items, digging up buried treasure, or hitting the seas in search of adventure then look no further. Your Adventure awaits.",
