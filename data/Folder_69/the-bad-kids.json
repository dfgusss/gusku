Our experience and strength will be seriously challenged, because 'Cat's Cradle' has a high popularity and influence in China. Worry and anxiety constantly haunt our team. We spent nearly a year to watch novels and TV series intensively, investigated all the analysis and comments on the network, and finally determined our ction after countless iterations of the scheme. We will divide the game into 5 chapters: The preface, Chapter 1-mom, Chapter 2-dad, Chapter 3-friends and Final chapter.
