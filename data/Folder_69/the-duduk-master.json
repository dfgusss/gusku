The player is often rewarded with items or abilities for solving puzzles or exploring hidden areas. Some items are recurring and appear many times throughout the game as bombs; potions, which can kill or paralyze enemies; keys to locked chests; creature eggs that can be created as pets, magic items, and other unique in-game items. Although the game has many RPG elements, the developer emphasizes straightforward platform-style combat. The game consists of unlocking and main areas: an overworld that connects all other areas, allowing you to move wherever you want; 'interaction areas' with other characters (caves or hidden rooms; entire cities and towns) where the player gains essential items or information, it is possible to buy equipment or complete some side quests; and dungeons, which are labyrinths, castles, comprising a wide range of new enemies, bosses, items and skills. Each boss usually has an important ability within, which can be essential in solving many of the puzzles and often plays a crucial role in the game's progression.",
