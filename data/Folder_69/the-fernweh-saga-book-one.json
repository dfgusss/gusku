The Fernweh Saga: Book One is a 600,000-word interactive, romantic thriller novel by Aelsa Trevelyan. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. Return to a small town that you now feel a stranger in. It has been years since you were sent away following the tragic house fire that claimed your parents' lives, but the death of your grandfather has brought you back. While grim circumstances overshadow the visit you never planned on making, there are also opportunities to reminisce, reconnect, and reunite with old childhood friends, rivals, and neighbors. Familiar faces are all around, but will they aid or hinder you as your return trip spirals into a dark mystery and you start experiencing vivid nightmares? Begin to unravel what is going on in this seemingly idyllic, forested town. A feeling of unease grows with each sleepless night spent within Fernweh's borders, but you can't leave yet… It won’t let you. Play as male, female, or non-binary–with options to be gay, straight, bi, asexual, or poly. Develop the beginning of a unique and enduring romance with 5 potential love interests. Influence relationship dynamics with a cast of characters from your past and present. Experience how your personality, habits, decisions, and relationships impact your visit to Fernweh and how you confront what lurks within the town. Discover that things aren’t always what they seem by making connections and noticing links. Fight, resist, flee, struggle, or give in to whatever is invading your nightmares and the town; there is more to it than a boring ole monster… Much more . Fall in love, forge friendships, and uncover your past while spiraling into a mystery!",
