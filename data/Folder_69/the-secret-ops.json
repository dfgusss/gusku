The fourth area is the 'weapon development area', which is used to develop weapons and equipment that can be applied to generation in order to deal with sudden disasters. The fifth area is the 'Core Research Area', a secret buried in this area, which players will discover by themselves at the end. the enemy you encountered According to first-hand accounts, four different alien races were present in the leak.
