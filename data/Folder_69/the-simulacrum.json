    "About the game": "Welcome to The Simulacrum, a unique blend of card-battling roguelite and deckbuilding gameplay with procedurally generated cards allowing for endless deckbuilding possibilities. Each run you'll find new never seen before cards, it's like having a new expansion every time you play. Delve into The Simulacrum, facing off against increasingly difficult opponents. As you progress through each level, you'll be able to collect new cards and add them to your deck, find events that may modify your cards in unpredictable ways, and discover new guardians to challenge. When a run is over, if you ventured deep enough, the cards you found will be added to your main collection, which you can use to build decks to challenge the difficult guardians of The Simulacrum and collect their leader cards. The deeper you delve, the more cards you'll bring back, adding more to your permanent toolbox of cards for use in this persistent mode. Find combos unique to your collection. With a practically limitless amount of different cards, you'll have access to a completely unique pool of cards compared to other players, both in delves and for the guardian fights. Adapt to the tools you have to build uniquely powerful decks and conquer The Simulacrum.",
