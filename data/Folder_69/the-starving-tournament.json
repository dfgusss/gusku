    "About the game": "The Starving Tournament will be a Multiplayer Survival Game, loosely based on the 'The Hunger Games' movies. The open alpha version is already available for public access. Try our open alpha, report bugs or give us your ideas to make it the best game it can be. About the project Being fascinated of the 'Hunger Games' arena idea and for the lack of a real game for the movies / books we wanted to start our own 'Hunger Games' fan project. So we started 'The Starving Tournament' - a tournament where 20 players will be put into differently designed arenas with traps, monsters and other dangers. But the biggest dangers are the other players and the HUNGER Will you be the last one standing and win the Starving Tournament? We are aware of the fact, that there have been other 'Hunger Games' like games before, but we want to go a step further and take more features from the actual 'Hunger Games' movie into our Game 'The Starving Tournament'. You can help us to achieve this goal, by downloading and playing the alpha version of the game, report us bugs, give us Feedback and help us to build an amazing GAME!!
