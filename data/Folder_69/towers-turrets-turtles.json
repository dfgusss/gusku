    "About the game": "Turrets, Towers, Turtles is a throwback to the classics of the Tower Defence genre, where you defend the computer tower from the endless hordes of villainous peas. Each Turret, Pea, and projectile is cel shaded in a clean, bright style with sharp outlines, meaning that even the most frantic of battles are easy to read and respond to. This is important since the Peas have more than a few tricks up their sleeves to keep you on your toes, ranging from armour and defences, speed, and even circus cannons! Learn how these unique enemies interact with the terrain and your turrets, then do your best to keep them at bay no matter what. Unlike many others in the genres, the peas won't follow a set path and will actively find the best way to get to the tower. it’s up to you to build deadly mazes and find the best way possible to stop them from getting through. Different types of Peas may not be coming from the same direction, so choosing where and when to place your turrets will mean the difference between victory and defeat. Money is tight and you'll need to respond quickly to keep up with the huge variety of Peas heading your way. Prepare your defences using an accessible yet powerful building and upgrade system, giving you endless choices with how you survive and progress. Each turret has it's use, and a unique super upgrade will help it specialise even further.",
