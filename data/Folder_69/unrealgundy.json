    "About the game": "Welcome to UnrealGundy, a 3D platformer made by drevil1200. You play as 'Gundy', a fictional character whose background is unknown and is tasked with traversing through a ruins-type environment with very dimly lit torches that provide a very eerie and mysterious path ahead. He has the task of not only locating the correct path and levels to traverse but also having the skill needed to properly land on each platform to get further. While playing, Gundy is required to locate the gun. After doing so, Gundy will need to fight many snakes who will not only pose a threat to Gundy, in his mission to destroy the Generator (thus unlocking the final boss chamber) but also to locate the final boss and fight it as well. This game is created upon the base concept of 'Gundy', a 2D platformer created by d4kd0s. This game has been created using certain assets provided in the original game with d4kd0s's permission. Check out Gundy for another fun game! /",
