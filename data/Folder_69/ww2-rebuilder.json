    "About the game": "ABOUT THIS GAME: Here is a game about war, in which we do not grab a rifle, but a hammer, and instead of destroying - we create. KEY FEATURES: It’s 1945. It’s the end of World War II, the war that left a mark. Now people like you have to leave their hometowns to rebuild their countries. Motivated by different reasons, they get set on the same quest - to repair and renovate places completely destroyed during the war. BUILDER SIMULATOR THAT TAKES YOU ON A JOURNEY AROUND EUROPE Visit monuments and buildings, stumble upon their history and take part in the biggest rebuilding missions. Meet civilians from England, Germany and France and guide them through the process. Through the journey you will collect resources and craft materials to flip houses, repair industrial buildings, roads and squares. Pick up a hummer or a trowel, drive in a bulldozer, become a mechanic and operator of various machines like a crane, drive jeep cars and bicycles. Clean up the area, defuse and get rid of the bombs and design the new look of a place by decorating. You can already play our game’s Demo that involves a map of Gimbert Station or a Germany Prologue with the area of St. Nicholas Church for FREE. /",
