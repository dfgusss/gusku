    "About the game": "You are an air traffic controller. Your duty is to manage the movement of drone planes , delivering cargo to one of the airports under your supervision. The airspace is busy, airplanes coming fast - so expect the task to be physically challenging and give you some fitness exercise. You will need to react fast, wise and predictive. Use exact and wide hand movements to assign rotes, rush from one side of airfield to another, bend and even jump to get the planes flying on higher levels - like you are DANCING between runways. Game features Various airports inspired by real world locations! Various difficulty levels! Various weather conditions! Various aircraft types! Available airports: Gibraltar (GIB) Tokyo (HND) Hong Kong (HGK) Seattle (SEA) San Francisco (SFO) Dallas (DFW) Sydney(SYD) Copenhagen(CPH) London(LHR) It was a usual, even boring, watch and nothing was foreshadowing problems, but suddenly you find out that the automatic air traffic management systems of your airport are out of order. The drone planes are capable of joining the circuit, navigating to the final approach and automatically landing. But they cannot see each other! It is not yet clear what happened, but the most likely is that the satellite array was hacked by an unknown evil terrorist organization, trying to cut the communications and leave the city without supplies! Your task is to enter an overloaded and glitching virtual air traffic control interface , and manually manage the aircraft traffic to save as much equipment and cargo as possible... Grab the planes from their automatically assigned routes by using the VR controllers, move between runways and draw a new safe route to avoid collisions! Don't forget that thunderstorms can be deadly dangerous and weather changes make your task even more challenging.... Future roadmap: Additional levels (Airports coming soon: Los Angeles and New York) Additional settings Improved performance Additional gameplay variety *Game does not work outside of a virtual reality environment.",
