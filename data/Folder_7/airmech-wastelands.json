You are one of a few skilled survivors who are able to operate AirMechs and maintain them. You begin in the center of what used to be America where pockets of survivors remain, since the coastlines were reduced to ashes during the war. You will rise up from scavenger to leader, adding AirMechs and the ability to build armies of your own to command. Will you discover the source of the continued attacks on humanity? Top-down RPG with Mechs: AirMech reimagined as an RPG where you explore a huge area of the world, gaining power and fame along the way.
