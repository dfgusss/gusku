    "About the game": "Destroy all asteroids and your self esteem! ASTROPUPPA will challenge you in a colourful (black and white) 3D (not true, it's 2D) battle (most of the time) against rocks a lot of stupid space things and creatures! Your aim is to reach the perfect run with 8888 points. If you don't manage to do it, it means you are a noob. So, please, if you fail, don't tell that the game is too hard or whatever. It's because YOU-ARE-A-NOOOOB. Game features: - Fourteen (13) levels with a lot of unpredictable things; - Audio FX produced by mouth; - hand-drawn (not exactly) Asteroids-like graphics; - enhanced instructions to become an ASTROPUPPA Jedi; - many many white pixels and an incredible number of black pixels; - hard gameplay mechanics to test how much time you can resist without getting angry and destroying the keyboard; - hypocritical elements completely unuseful for people without a human sensibility; - press keys randomly and maybe something will happen. TIP1: PAUSE KILLS! TIP2: DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE! And last but not least, if you are a NOOB and you are not able to win at this game, don't put a bad review. PUPPA again. The game is not long as the bible, so you can find the needed minutes to play it. So, if you put a bad review, it means you surrended and that you are a NOOB!",
