    "About the game": "'Work together to explore and survive, and/or sabotage one another and let the ship go down in fire and flood.' - Rock Paper Shotgun WELCOME TO EUROPA Barotrauma is a 2D co-op survival horror submarine simulator, inspired by games like FTL: Faster Than Light, Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress and Space Station 13. It’s a Sci-Fi game that combines ragdoll physics and alien sea monsters with teamwork and existential fear. EMBRACE THE ABYSS In the not too distant future, humanity has fled to Jupiter’s moon. With its irradiated icy surface, life can only be found in the ocean below. Travel through a punishing underwater world and discover what lies in the depths of Europa. Stay alert: danger in Barotrauma doesn’t announce itself. HELP YOUR CREW SUCCEED, OR MAKE SURE NO ONE DOES There are as many ways to enjoy Barotrauma as there are ways to die in it. Work together with your crew to achieve your goals, or brace for betrayal when you have a traitor on board. Play with friends, strangers, or your worst enemies. EXPLORE, OPERATE, COMMUNICATE Navigate underwater, complete missions for the last remnants of humankind, explore the ruins of an alien civilization, flee or fight monsters. Operate complex on-board systems and devices like the sonar, nuclear reactor, weapons, engines and pumps. Communication is key! EXPERIMENT, CRAFT, CREATE Master the complex on-board wiring and the comprehensive crafting and medical systems.
