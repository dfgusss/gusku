The game is told from four different points of view: - Luke, who is on Mars with his friends but he can't stop thinking about Tanya and what she told him - Tom, who is also on Mars, has strong unconfessed feelings for Helen, Luke's girlfriend - Tanya, an android that decided to stay on Earth, wants to fight against Richard, but will she be able to do it alone? - Tina, an honest police officer, has strong suspicions about Nanotech and wants to investigate them. Each character choice will change the outcome of the story.",
