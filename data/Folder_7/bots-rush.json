    "About the game": "No one asks where the towers take the shells, but here you have to answer this question. Build quarries and mines Handle initial resources in plants Produce shells Deliver them to the towers. Avoid traffic jams by driving routes.[/] 6 types of inputs 6 factories 8 types of towers Warehouses help solve a number of transportation problems. More than 60 types of enemies advancing on land, in the air and on the water. And some even try to do something against player On 4 maps, the enemies go constantly, and we must first hold off their attack, and only then destroy their spawn. Two characters - Soldier and Engineer. Place them inside the desired building and increase its efficiency. Think. Many towers, but few shells? Many shells, but not enough towers? A lot of shells, but not there? Just enough, but the shells hit in traffic jams? All these interesting events await players.",
