    "About the game": "In Bromeliad you are stranded on a pacific island where you are a Human-Bear. You transformed into a Human-Bear because of a mysterious, unknown creature that gave you its strange venom. After that, a giant bear jumped on you and you became a mutant. You don`t know what has happened, or where you are, or where your hunter team is. You have to survive, gathering materials to build tools, bases/houses/castles. You will need to hunt for food, explore, tame animals and creatures and much more... but the only strange thing other than you being a mutant is that, at night, strange creatures crawl and sneak over the island trying to find you. Features: Survive and explore this living island. Chop down trees and break rocks to craft tools, build bases... Tame animals and creatures and keep them as pet, to protect you from enemies. At night creatures will attack, so be ready. And much more... Your destiny is to survive and find an ancient element hidden on the island so that you can go back to being normal as a human. Then you will be able to remember everything and return home, but remember, its not so easy to get there because you are not alone.",
