    "About the game": "Circuit: Laser Maze is a single-player laser puzzle game that expands gameplay into 3D, elevating this classic genre to new heights. Test your critical thinking as you guide lasers through multi-dimensional puzzles. Aim skyward in vertical mazes. Bend, extend, and combine lasers to overcome obstacles and complete each circuit. Immerse yourself in the satisfying sounds, retro atmosphere, and challenging puzzles of Circuit: Laser Maze. FEATURES • 3D gameplay • 60+ increasingly-complex puzzles • Multiple Puzzle Environments (Training, Hurdles, Vertical, Horizontal, Motion, Separation, and Dark) • Choose your own path with the game's non-linear progression system. Stuck on a puzzle? No problem... Skip it and keep moving forward. • 360° rotational camera with fully customizable speed controls • Key-binding system to further customize your gaming experience HOW TO PLAY To complete each circuit, connect the laser to its endpoint by placing the modules correctly within each puzzle. Some modules extend the length of the laser, others change its direction or color, some allow lasers to pass through each other and others still combine and separate colors. Stuck on a puzzle? Use the built-in hint system to guide your way. Be warned, to use the hint system you must first collect the hint crystals. Many are easy to acquire, but some may be more challenging than the puzzle itself. Xbox controller support Windows: Fully Supported Mac: Partially Supported Linux: Not Supported See key binding documentation for controller layouts.",
