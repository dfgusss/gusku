    "About the game": "Dynamic 3D Pathfinding Both colonists and monsters can find their way in your world. Build bridges, tunnels, stairs, overpasses and underpasses to make sure your colonists get where they want to go, and monsters don't! Plant a banner to start your colony. As you recruit more colonists, more monsters will try to invade your colony! Build walls, dig moats and construct forts to deal with the increasing threat. Dozens of different jobs, unlockable with science Use an extensive science system to unlock jobs, blocks, upgrades and new weapons! Your colony will start small, with a couple of berry farmers, slingers and a copper miner. Expand your colony and start using new metals like bronze, iron and steel. Producing them will require new fuels like charcoal and cokes. Use more advanced metals to unlock crossbows and matchlock guns for your guards! Add wheat farmers, bakers, flax farmers, tailors and many other jobs to your colony. Explore and settle a large, diverse world Large, advanced colonies are able to unlock the glider and Colony Starter Kits, allowing them to settle new lands. Take to the sky and explore a world with multiple continents and biomes. Start a colony in far-off lands to get access to new jobs, crops and resources. Co-op: play with friends without problems Easily launch a co-op server from the main menu, and invite friends to join your world. Share ownership of a single colony with multiple friends, or build your own colonies and trade items and science. It's also possible to use our advanced server tool to set up a more complex system.

Use cheats to quickly recruit more colonists, spawn blocks and unlock research. Detailed graphics settings: don't like bloom or depth of field? Want to adjust the FOV? Change it quickly in the graphics menu. Game settings: turn off monsters if you want to build in peace. Or allow them to spawn during the day for a difficult challenge! Mods: we've developed the game to be as moddable as possible, and we're in close contact with mod developers to help them create awesome mods. Advanced server tool: every player can use our intuitive server tool to host a private server for friends, or a public server for the entire community. Transparent development: we explain what we're working on and why in regular Friday Blogs. We're continuously trying to figure out what the community would like to see tweaked and added next by being active on the Steam Forums and the official Discord.",
