    "About the game": "Help the little space-traveller Euler on a journey across the Cubiverse to collect power crystals. You will have to think outside the box - or in this case, cube - to reach your goal. Features Explore 9 galaxies with different, colorful settings! Puzzle your way through increasingly difficult puzzle mechanics - sometimes puzzles are even combined with each other for some extra hard puzzles! Challenge yourself to solve all levels with as little turns as possible to get three stars! Every planet is based on the magic cube, with three rows to turn. The twist - pun intended - is that the goal is not to get all tiles of the same color on one side. That would be too easy! You'll help our little astronaut collect a crystal and bring it back to the spaceship. You will have to control Euler's movement across the cube and rotate the rows on the planet to solve these puzzles. We have some real brain-twisters in store for you. Can you solve all levels and collect all stars?",
