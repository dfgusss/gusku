    "About the game": "Earthworm Jim, spineless superhero, wriggles back into action as the Groovy Guardian of Goodness in an incredible journey of cheese-curdling proportions. Left unconscious by a massive cow-induced blow to the head and clad in his indestructible, high-tech super suit, Earthworm Jim continues the battle for truth, justice and well aerated soil. He sure is going to need your help to guide him through his 3D fun-house of a brain. But beware, the is an evil lurking, a presence in his mind, a dark unseen force at work - Jim's brain is a dangerous place! In the game you can enter Jim's psyche where he comes face to face with his own fears, happiness, memories and fantasies. Each environment has games-within-games, ludicrously large levels where you go wild pig-sliding, grandma wrangling and much more. You will face the weird enemies like Psycrow or the Disco Zombies. Explore any area you choose while keeping the trigger ready for action. The wacky worm is back in a massive 3-D serach for sanity. 4 brains to navigate 5 evil bosses to battle including: Professor Monkey for a Head, Psy-Crow, Bob the Goldfish, and Fatty Roswell. 13 weapons including the Groovy Gun, the Chicken Gun, Banana-Myte, and the good old hair flamer! 15 levels + final mega-boss showdown!!! 40 of Earthworm Jim’s allies and enemies! Hundreds of puzzles to solve",
