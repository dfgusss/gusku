A few brave citizens belonging to this future world agree to devote their lives to this aim. Secluded in the colony of UT-OP-I4, they and their offspring will try and live independently and in harmony. Yet, they ignore that their every move will be scrutinized and analyzed....

You are the demiurge of UT-OP-I4, a servant of humanity. Decipher the secrets of our genetics and show us the way. Gameplay 'Eugenics' works like Mastermind board game : first, you'll have to identify every gene and its effect. Then, you'll be able to modify and edit the genome. As a demiurge, you will however have to render account to the company that employs you. But you can decide if you want to make the world better place, make money, or even if you just want to follow the latest fashion ! Easy to learn but difficult to master...The game is highly replayable, and some missions have the same dark humor as Dr. Strangelove movie. Features Two gameplays in one : discovery and manipulation of the genome Great freedom to the player, without moral compass Numerous genes to discover An original story mode Dozens of missions and achievements in the free mode All the characters in the colony have a life of their own A dystopian and hypercute art direction Dark humor A game easy to learn, but difficult to master High replay value.",
