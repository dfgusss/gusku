    "About the game": "Everpixel Tactics is a turn-based, tactical, roguelike RPG lootfest set in a dynamic, procedurally-generated fantasy world. Lead a motley crew of mercenaries to greatness - or die trying. Hire samurai penguins, obese unicorns, or spell-flinging mages as you manage your company, go on epic quests, and save your pixelated world. Features: Squad Management: Lead a motley crew of fantastical mercenaries - wereslugs, troll knights, human mages, dinosaurs, and more. Tactical RPG combat: Experience deep, squad-based combat with brutal injuries. Fantastic, Pixelated Worlds: Explore surreal, procedurally-generated, pixelated worlds packed to the brim with fantasy tropes. A Living, Breathing World: Explore procedurally-generated worlds that change over time. Watch as accidentally-summoned demons change the land around them into hellscapes, or maniacal mages open portals to other planes of existence. Magic corrupts the world around it. The dead may rise again in lands of necromancy, while grievous injuries may mend themselves in lands of biomancy. Interact with factions throughout the world each with their own cultures, heroes, and motives. Embark on epic quests to try to save the world. Seek out and find artifacts powerful enough to shape the world around you - or die trying. Deep, Unrestricted Builds: Build your mercenaries from hundreds of perks and traits. Every weapon; every ability they impart, has a time and a place. Hammers penetrate heavy armor, but are difficult to parry with. Swords are great for parrying, but can struggle against heavy armor. Dozens of spells: Sling fireballs, heal your allies, raise zombies and more. Fantasy Tropes Galore: Encounter dozens of monsters each requiring their own strategies to defeat: slimes, dinosaurs, giant penguins, and more. Ever heard of a werewolf? How about a wereslug? Elves, orcs, and wereslugs - if it's a fantasy trope, Everpixel Tactics probably has it. Fantastical cultures with their own strategies in combat. Encounter orcs who ride wiener dogs into battle, human knights adorned in heavy armor, and trolls who herd mushrooms. About Us: Doom Dino Games is currently a one-man show. I am a professional software engineer that never forgot why I became a software engineer in the first place - I wanted to make great games. Eclectically inspired by games as varied as Diablo 2, XCom, Super Mario, Final Fantasy, Battle Brothers, World of Warcraft, Dwarf Fortress and Baldur's Gate 2, I am passionate about making games that I want to play myself. I didn't make this game alone, however. I couldn't have made this game without the brilliant (and ongoing) support from Benvictus and Nyknck.",
