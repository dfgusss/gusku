You can complete the mission through enhanced action capability by interaction with monsters using simple buttons. At present, this game contains four worlds and two levels of difficulty. There are many checkpoints on normal difficulty level, and it is not hard to complete the mission other than full collections.  Grateful acknowledgement is made to juhani.junkala for the free music on opengameart. Five background music with SFC style perfectly matches with the game's overall style and the play rhythm.
