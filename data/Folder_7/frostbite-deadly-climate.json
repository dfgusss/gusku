    "About the game": "A lone Arctic Biologist ends up getting lost in a sudden snow storm and must take refuge in an arctic research base simply called Base 75. However, the base has no power (meaning no heat) and what’s worse it is clear he is not alone in Base 75. Frostbite: Deadly Climate is a First-Person Survival-Horror game that takes heavy inspiration from John Carpenter’s The Thing in Setting/Story with gameplay similar to Resident Evil 7. Along with a heavy focus on Atmospheric/Psychological Horror over Cheap/Mindless Jumpscares. Taking place in an arctic setting, players must watch their body temperature as it will slowly drain throughout. As the body temperature decreases the player will notice some negative effects and will even loose health if their body temp is at 0%. Game Features Exploration, Item Management, Puzzles, and Combat is the primary gameplay. an Area Temperature system that can be affected by the players actions and in return affects the player character’s body temperature. 4 Difficulty Modes (Easy, Normal, Hard, and Nightmare). a Resident Evil inspired Save System that requires an item to save your game. a Silent Hill inspired Map system that marks open/lock doors and presents your current objective. And much, much more.",
