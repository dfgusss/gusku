    "About the game": "Ghosts of Hollow Creek is a story-rich, single-player, 90s-style fantasy RPG with multiple endings to the game's story (roughly 15 to 20 hours to complete). All the characters in the party are customizable by look, name, and class. The romantic interest of the main character is also customizable so the player can enjoy a relationship that appeals to them. Combat is turn-based and each of the available 12 classes is designed to play differently. While the game is focused on the main quest line, there are side quests available and player can explore on the World Map. Weapons can be upgraded, armor crafted, and fishing/cooking is available when Camping. The player can also run dungeons (Lacuna Dungeons) on the side during the story to level up, find gear, gain gold, etc. if they find they are behind in level or gear for a quest area. A Tutorial is also available in-game from the title screen.",
