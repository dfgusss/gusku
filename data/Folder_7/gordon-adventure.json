    "About the game": "GORDON ADVENTURE TAKES 5 MINUTES TO BEAT! THIS IS A VERY SMALL* GAME IT CONTAINS ONLY 3 STAGES. Questions: Why did you make this? - I like the idea of making beginner friendly games. I believe there is room for any kind of game. Why only 3 Stages? -I really like the idea of making it small... I think that by being small, the game is easyer and is more beginner friendly. - I always wanted to make a game that can be completed by any kind of player. I am also learning on how to make platformers. So basically when fitting everything together I came up with this. - The other reason why it has only 3 stages is because I am stil new to the platform genre, so I am unaware if people will enjoy my game or not. FIRST GAME WITH WALKABLE CHARACTER If I feel like people are really enjoying this new genre of game. I may make more games like this. They haven proven to me to be easyer to be made and required less effort then my IDLE games. Maybe mix up a little bit in the future?
