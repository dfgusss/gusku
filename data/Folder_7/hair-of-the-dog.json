    "About the game": "Play our new demo for free If you love a retro pixel art point &amp; click adventure, check out Lucy Dreaming, our brand new comedy adventure packed full of pop-culture references! / A thoroughly British adventure After a mysterious explosion over Victorian London, Cummerbund Bandersnatch visits his uncle to find he's been experimenting with a new formula he's created in an attempt to give himself a 'good time'. Seduced by the promises in his uncle's journal, Cummerbund decides to drink the same formula and discovers that his life will no longer be the same again (at least between the hours of 8pm - 8am daily). Can he reverse the effects of the formula before it's too late? An hour of mystery, cannibalism and nob jokes Hair of the Dog is inspired and influenced by the classic 90s point &amp; click adventure games, from its retro pixel-art style to its irreverent, sarcastic humour. This exquisitely voiced comedy provides an hour of frivolous point &amp; click goodness like no other. Play in real time This game can be played in 'real time'. Meaning that if you play between the hours of 8pm - 8am some of the scenes, objects, actions and characters differ to those found during the rest of the day. Of course, if you don't want your game to last several months, you can enable 'Time skip' mode in the game's settings. Game Features: Control time – but beware it comes at a cost! From Louse-tamers to street urchins, you'll encounter a cast of colourful characters. Explore rich environments with an abundance of witty retorts to almost everything you can point your cursor at. Enjoy the distinctive and beautifully realised voice acting (English) Travel instantly between scenes with a double-click. Having trouble? Just hit the space bar to get a sneaky peek of each scene’s hotspots.",
