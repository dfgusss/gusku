    "About the game": "Hope's Journey features a unique blend of innovative gameplay and evidence-based techniques to help players learn CBT and recognize common cognitive biases, for a better mental wellbeing. Gameplay elements include the unique mechanic of 'thought catching'. Just like in real life, some events and interactions trigger negative thoughts in Hope's mind, which the player needs to catch by pressing the appropriate directional button. Key Features: A true video game to improve your mental wellbeing. Learn the basics of CBT and common cognitive biases. Unique and innovative gameplay, mixing adventure, puzzles and RPG elements. 'Catch' and analyze Hope's thoughts as she faces everyday issues not unsimilar to the ones you face. Neuroscience-based puzzles augment and complement the therapeutic content. Story-driven experience not without a sense of humor. Colorful and interesting characters. Story: The school's counselor approaches Hope after noticing she's not feeling particularly good. After explaining the basics of CBT, the counselor gives her a device that is meant to help her notice her thoughts. However, Hope soon discovers that there's more to this device than she could've ever imagined, and that the counselor's intentions weren't as innocent as she had led her to believe.",
