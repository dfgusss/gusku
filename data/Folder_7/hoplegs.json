    "About the game": "Hoplegs is a different kind of platform game where you control your character using 4 different legs. Looks easy? Each of the four gamepad buttons where you usually jump, interact, crouch and change weapons are now your legs! Master the unique controls, and navigate through loads of developer and community-created levels! Love to create? Let your imagination run wild with our custom level editor! From puzzle levels with switches that control almost anything, to space-inspired levels with zero gravity, to impossible mountains to climb, there’s really nothing to hold your creative ideas back! We showcase the best community-created levels for everyone to enjoy! Customise your look with stylish hats, boxes and legs - even new faces! Keep your eyes open for rare and special items in secret hidden areas! Can you find them all? Tired of adventuring on your own? Bring a friend along for the adventure and raise the difficulty a notch further with the ultimate friendship test! If adventuring together proves too much, or if you are more into duking it out with your friends the brand new Versus mode is for you: take on up to 3 friends in the king-of-the-hill-style versus mode. /",
