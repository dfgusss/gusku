Sit closer to the fireplace, let in one hand you hold a fragrant foamy beer, complemented to the brim, and in the other you wash the lush boobs of a juicy girl who would twirl her ass on her knee, so that when bringing beer to your mouth, it flows down your mustache yes did not get into the mouth. And everywhere you hear fascinating stories, one after another they are replaced, just like the beer in the mug was refreshed and in every sip, you are ready to absorb more and more new adventures. So delight your passionate curiosity to see our adventure story, where vices are glorified in a dance of recklessness and passion. About the game: This is an adventurous visual novel, with a number of protagonists who will be gradually introduced through certain parts. And perhaps already in the third version of the game will become final. At the very beginning of the game, you are introduced to the mushroom picker Vasily, who in the future will still make itself felt, like other characters, girls, guys who, one way or another, will be revealed already in the third part (I hope the last and more laborious) The gameplay of the game consists of the usual choice from the action menu, but this is only in this part, in the next update time, date, quests will be introduced, all as according to the canon of 'Akabura' if anyone had the honor to get acquainted with his adventures. Attention! [/] Although for the most part the game consists of dialogues, but it contains erotic, I would even say, porn scenes, but without cruel treatment and any sadistic moments, everything is expressed in mutual agreement. Version 2.0 consists of an entry into the main, more global, both in gameplay and lore game, which will follow further after these parts.",
