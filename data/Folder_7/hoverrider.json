    "About the game": "This is a racing game set in the year 2090. In this world where cities and nature are adjacent to each other, players will race to achieve faster times. This game will give you a new feeling of control that you will never get from other games of the same genre. Graphics One of the features of this game is its graphics, which are as good as those of games sold by other companies. There are two courses, one with daylight and the other with night, each with a bright atmosphere, and one with a somewhat cold atmosphere in pitch-darkness, partially illuminated by the lights of the streets and buildings. Both stages can be changed according to the player's preference, allowing the player to enjoy the scenery while driving. Time Attack Players compete for the fastest time to complete one lap of the course. The game is a different kind of hovercraft from conventional games, and players can use it to drive through the course at super speeds. You will be able to get an unprecedented feeling of control as you run across the course at speeds of 300 kilometers per hour. Online Ranking You can send your time recorded in Time Attack to the online ranking system to compete with other users around the world. The game is a great way to improve your hovercraft operation skills and to race faster than other players from around the world. translator : DeepL",
