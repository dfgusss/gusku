    "About the game": "You play as Maya Anderson, a certified hypnotherapist who uses a special technique to enter her clients’ inner worlds. One day she gets an offer to question patients of the mental facility where head doctor has mysteriously disappeared. While exploring patients' subconsciousnesses she unveils their personal fears and fights phobias all to find her own self and uncover much bigger, all-embracing problem. Key features: - Point-and-click adventure game enhanced by arcade elements; - Intriguing story with a good old-fashioned romantic plot and a chance to save the world; - Well-written characters' development; - Unique art style, music, and atmosphere for each character's inner world; - Sexy costumes for Maya (if you fancy). We have tried to build an immersive psychedelic experience in the form of comfy casual game and we really hope you'll enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it.",
