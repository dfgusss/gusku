Intruder allows for stealth, teamwork, tactics, and environmental interactions never seen before in a multiplayer game.

In Intruder, amazing stories and immersive gameplay come from the players’ actions to provide an experience you will never forget.

Last but not least, experience realistic ballistics with windage and bullet drop in effect. 3D Audio Communicate with your teammates using both the hand radio and proximity voice chat.
