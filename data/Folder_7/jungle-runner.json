    "About the game": "JUNGLE RUNNER this is a classic runner game with a procedurally generated world and various bonuses (such as equipment that saves death or boots that speed up running), but in cinematic graphics. For those who do not know: a runner is a game where the goal is to run as far as possible from the starting position, and for more interest there will be various obstacles on the way. In this game, you have to run through beautiful, but no less dangerous, picturesque places in the jungle and futuristic abandoned enterprises. Wild jungles and closed laboratories are obviously unsafe places, which, of course, is pretty bad, but it’s much more fun to play this way, because what’s the interest in running through a wasteland or a treadmill, where nothing can fall on your head, and you won’t meet on the way not a single stormy mountain river? In order to feel the role of the protagonist more strongly, the game is implemented in high-end graphics, and fire particles are barely distinguishable from a blazing PC in real life! In general, there is no more time to explain. It's time to run and save your life from the fate of being drowned, falling into a hole or fried to a crisp! The main thing is not to forget good equipment that will obviously help you along the way!",
