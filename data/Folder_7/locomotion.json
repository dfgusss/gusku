Haul wagons, flick switches, and reclaim your lost gold, through fifty-one increasingly tricky levels from home on the range to the final frontier. Explore a captivating cartoon world. Solve challenging puzzles using over a dozen mechanics. Use a magnet to haul a wagon onto a switch, turning a turntable holding a fan that blows you to the next level. Unravel a story of loss, vengeance, and unidentified flying objects.",
