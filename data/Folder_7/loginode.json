    "About the game": "Disclaimer : This is game gets pretty complicated. If you haven't played any similar games like Hexcells or Minesweeper before, it might be worth checking one of them out first to see if you're likely to enjoy this game. LogiNode is set in a web of nodes that are either blank or colorful, but most of them are hidden. Your job is to deduce whether the hidden nodes are blank or colorful, using the information they give you. If you like challenging Minesweeper-like games that do not require guessing, this is for you!",
