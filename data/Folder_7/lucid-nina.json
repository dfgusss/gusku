    "About the game": "Nina is so full of problems that she barely recognizes herself. Try to understand her world, views and beliefs from her perspective and guide her through her dreams. Through perception, observation, trial and error, help a poor girl find out what's happening in her mind. Guide her through the seven doors around her bed and find a way to comprehend what they mean. Don't neglect anything: every object may contain a piece of crucial information. Story Driven Narrative: This game is a story that needs to be told. There aren't fights other than Nina's. Another Way of Horror: Lucid Nina isn't about jumpscares, but interpreting dreams and helping one girl along the way. Focus on Exploration: In a simple and intuitive 'move-and-interact' gameplay, don't let anything go unnoticed. Clues are essential in Lucid Nina. Gameplay Time: Estimated to be around 30 minutes. Arrow Keys: Move Enter/Z: Confirm &amp; Interact Esc/X: Cancel &amp; Menu F4: Toggle Fullscreen",
