    "About the game": "Mhakna and Sebiarno have seen better days. Their orphanage is run by a cranky old lady, who will turn the two into animals and sell them in the city if they do not find a foster parent by the age of 10. With a little help from a Fairy called Bell, they escape to Enles Land, a kingdom of eternal happiness for children, leaving their former lives behind. Here, they meet other children just like them. But little do they notice... something is amiss in this utopia for children. Started as a project commemorating the “fault series” selling over 300,000 copies worldwide, “Mhakna Gramura and Fairy Bell” is a spin-off Cinematic Novel produced with newcomers in mind. Reading through the original fault series is not necessary. Styled as a children's book with over 150 unique pages of art drawn by Hare Konatsu and animated by Saketai, music scored by Foxtail-Grass Studio, and a story written by the series' author Munisix, “Mhakna Gramura and Fairy Bell” is a bittersweet children’s story about happiness and what it really means to grow up. The story is about 90 minutes long and features no choices. Please do not purchase if this is not appealing to you.",
