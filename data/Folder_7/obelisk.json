    "About the game": "You wake up, and there's a giant black obelisk towering in front of you. What is it? What does it mean? What secrets does it hold? Can you solve its mysteries? Dive into the extremely challenging atmospheric logic puzzle/riddle game unlike any other. Prepare to use all of your brainpower. Prepare to think outside the box. Prepare to face the Obelisk. STORY Obelisk features a tucked-back powerful backstory, which you can follow by noticing subtle hints and finishing the game. DISCLAIMER Obelisk is a difficult game. Prepare to spend possibly hours on figuring out the very obscure and challenging puzzles with increasing difficulty. You will need to think outside the box, and you will almost certainly need to use external sources of information to solve Obelisk, and/or communicate with other members of the community to find solutions. COMMUNITY Visit the ObeliskCommunity subreddit and talk to other players, help each other with the puzzles or ask the devs a question.",
