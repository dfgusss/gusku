A maximum of three explorers per session can experience a post-apocalyptic world after the Earth became unable to sustain life. Be a crew member of a large space station inhabited by a group of scientists in search of a new home. The scientists hope to preserve parts of the Earth’s biodiversity in isolated ecosystem bubbles connected to the station. You must protect the ecosystem bubbles, because they carry the last remaining plants and animals from Earth. Travel through space and look for the answers, because humanity is counting on you.
