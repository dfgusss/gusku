    "About the game": "Omen Exitio: Plague is a Lovecraftian adventure, inspired by the choose-your-own-adventure gamebooks of the 80s and 90s. You’ll play as a military doctor who has to investigate a disease that threatens to exterminate the entire human race -- and unexplainable, who knows if preternatural origins. A race against time and reason that will strain your sanity to its very limits -- and the survival of the whole world may depend on your decisions. Zanzibar, 1896. You are Dr. Jake Huntington, recently enlisted in the army trying to forget the loss of your dear wife Helen. An ancient evil is about to overturn your life forever. Every hint you find seems to lead you to the same conclusion: there is a terrifying disease that threatens to exterminate the entire human race -- and its origins may not be entirely natural. To understand what’s going on and try to stop it, you'll have to venture into the shadows that lurk in the confines of the human intellect, unraveling the intrigues, machinations, and subterfuges that try to veil the truth in darkness. But meanwhile, there’s always the same question, gnawing at the corners of your mind: is there really something supernatural in this mystery... or maybe you’re just going insane? Many challenges, mysteries, friends, and enemies await you, Doctor. The time to face the unknown has come. CHOOSE YOUR OWN STORY Your choices will determine how the story unfolds. There are multiple ways to overcome the different obstacles that you will face, and every decision will have its consequences -- for you and for the fate of the entire human race. You’ll be able to develop your character in countless ways through an RPG-like character sheet and how you interact with other characters and your surroundings, which will affect the different endings and possibilities. This story is entirely yours. DISTURBING AND CAPTIVATING LOVECRAFTIAN ATMOSPHERE This original story (with more than 140,000 words), the 300+ hand-drawn images, and the new original tracks, all have been meticulously crafted in a way that will make you feel like you’re living a H.P. Lovecraft story. The unsettling mood of this Victorian London will keep you on the edge of your seat, shivering at horrors both real and imagined -- for your mind can conjure worse terrors than anything you could find in reality. SOME CONSEQUENCES MAY BE WORSE THAN DEATH In Omen Exitio: Plague there are no right or wrong answers. All choices affect the story in different ways, and death is an only narrative-driven event -- you won’t get stuck in a defeat screen because you made a mistake. However, don’t forget that the destiny of the world is what it’s at stake here -- your choices might have worse consequences than death itself… A HIGHLY REPLAYABLE EXPERIENCE As an adventure with multiple choices and ways to develop the story and the character, you can play it several times and get to discover all the narratives, characters, endings and achievements.",
