Control your character, position, angle and power when you throw the ping pong ball. This game includes 4 modes - Challenge, Score Attack, VS, and 50 Cup. - Challenge This mode requires you to complete specific challenges such as 'Bounce the ball 3 times and sink it in the cup!' There are 2-3 missions in all 80 stages of this game making the conditions and difficulties vary in each stage. - Score Attack Throw 15 ping pong balls and try to get as many in the cup as you can. You will receive bonus points when you consecutively succeed. - VS Two players will throw ping pong balls and compete who can score better. This mode allows you to use items that will give you multiple balls or place obstruction blocks that get in the way of your opponent. You can share your Joy-Con so why not play with a bunch of your friends? - 50 Cup Throw balls into the 50 cups that move towards you in a steady pace. You can only throw up to 150 balls so precision is key.",
