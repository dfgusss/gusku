    "About the game": "Basic lore In 2015 the outstanding and secret 'New Horizons' project started on a few small islands in the middle of the Pacific. Only the best and most innovative scientists were looked after. The research of our past epochs should be revulotionized. In only three to four years it was possible to bring the first living beings and objects into the present day. Until the storm came and changed everything ..... Severe electrical disturbances led to an uncontrolled system breakdown. Huge cracks formed from which living beings from various early epochs emerged into the seas around the island. Electromagnetic storms make it impossible for planes to reach it from the air. The creatures in the sea prevent ships from reaching the islands. With the help of the latest satellite technology, a barrier was created around the islands that kills everything that goes beyond or into it. As part of the education and research, you penetrate the brain of one of these monstrosities and explore the interplay underwater. But not only your host is hungry ... the other voracious predators underwater too. The game PMM is an aquatic based, semi-realistic, open world survival game. The player can dive into the ocean as a reptile, mammal or fish. Starting as a juvi or getting nested/born as a baby. Group up with friends or play solo. Hunt AI or other players. Explore unique biomes an caves.",
