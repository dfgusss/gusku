    "About the game": "Step into the evolving world of Project Existence, a sandbox MMO prototype in active development that lets players test and try out new features and game mechanics. Project Existence is Arctic Theory’s canvas used for design exploration and world building of our upcoming MMO game, all while inviting players to take part in the development process. A sandbox, multiplayer canvas The world of Project Existence is constantly changing and evolving. Features and mechanics are implemented depending on what the team wants to focus on next. Creating a massively multiplayer game takes time and effort, and Project Existence is our way to try out new ideas and technology in a live environment. What to expect? When you step into Existence (pun intended) you’re greeted with a massive world filled with snow and empty space. The features currently implemented is resource gathering from trees and rocks, and in the coming months we will be introducing a mission based system where you can put those resources to use. If you’re expecting a game with hours of gameplay, you’re going to be really disappointed. If you’re interested in trying out mechanics as they are being developed, talking to developers and providing feedback, you’re in for a treat! Since we’re treating Project Existence as our very own personal development sandbox, features we have previously implemented are still subject to change, or even removed completely. Everything we do in this prototype, is laying the groundwork for our future title. By playing Project Existence, you might experience: Bugs, occasional broken features and sometimes confusing UI Satisfaction when features finally start working properly (maybe) Contemplation of life, and what you’re doing here in the first place So join in on the fun! To stay updated on what we’re working on and what we have planned for Project Existence, join us on Discord where we actively engage with the community, answer questions and gather feedback!",
