    "About the game": "Note from the Developer Hi there! Project H was originally developed with the intention of being a small prototype/proof of concept. It wasn't the original intention to publish this project, but I decided to do so for the experience and to see how people would like this kind of game. I hope you all enjoy your time with Project H! About Project H Make your escape while a persistent spirit haunts your every move. From turning on/off lights to altering the environment around you, it is made clear you are not supposed to leave. The spirit has the ability to: - Turn on/off the lights. - Turn on the radio. - Open and close doors. - Appear as a shadow figure every now and then. - Haunt various items and furniture within the rooms, which alters their appearances. Some items/furniture have two stages of alteration while others just have one. - Cause the phone to ring. The spirit's behavior is completely randomized, meaning a different experience for each player. Depending on how long you play, you may not even see all of the various alterations of the environment.",
