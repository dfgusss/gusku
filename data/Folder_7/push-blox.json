    "About the game": "Challenging block-pushing puzzle game, where the aim is to connect together all blocks of the same color. Navigate locks, conveyors, lasers, and other obstacles, amid fiendishly designed levels and contraptions. Features: - Hand-made puzzles - Gradually increasing difficulty from simple to deep - A relaxing, original guitar soundtrack - Sleek, minimalist interface Controls: WASD or cursors to move; Z or Backspace to undo; F to toggle windowed play/full-screen; SPACE to run. Note from developer: There is a minor real-time element that does not result in any dexterity challenge or timing difficulties. This is a warning here in case you can't tolerate any timing in your puzzle games - no matter how oblique and secondary they are to the actual puzzles in the present case. If you are such a person I would still recommend you play the game, but you have been given fair warning!",
