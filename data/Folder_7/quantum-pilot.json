    "About the game": "-new-indie-games-of-the-week/#more-488757 '.. exceedingly clever and the gnawing sense of deja vu throughout gives it an ethereal quality despite the mounting intensity. ' Overview Every enemy ship is a clone of how you killed them. Survive the onslaught of your own pattern replayed against you to upgrade your weapon. Kill the clones fast enough or the Deadline will make them lock onto you and if it reaches you - kill you. Remember your pattern to conserve ammo and shoot efficiently but if you miss - spray and pray, knowing that the next round will have those bullets coming right back at you! Features * Builtin speedrun time tracking * 5 main game modes across Solo, Cooperative, Duel and 2 difficulties * 2 Bonus Challenge modes after beating the game * Huge replay value - no game the same * Surprise mode: Show your friends the game and don't tell them how the AI works.. :)",
