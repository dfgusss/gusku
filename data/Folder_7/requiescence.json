    "About the game": "Overview: It's been a year of hard travel, but finally, the young mage Kymil arrives at his destination. He's a Cyromancer - a spellcaster who wields the power of ice to smite down his enemies. Kymil learned how to harness his power thanks to his uncle, a well-renowned adventurer who hunted down treasure on every corner of the continent. But his uncle was murdered in his home by an unknown assailant, and Kymil is driven to uncover the mystery behind his death. The only clue he has is an unfinished entry in his uncle's notes about a mysterious cathedral in the middle of the sprawling Dead Plains... When he arrives at the cathedral, Kymil has no idea what he's searching for or where to go. But something in him presses him forward, and he's determined to figure out the cathedral's secrets, no matter how dire the cost. Features: 125,000 word novel -- 10-15 hours of gameplay! Unique hybrid of Western and Anime-style art -- 17 CGs and 13 Characters with unique expressions! Interactivity -- 3 different romance routes with 6 total endings! Partial English voice acting! Full original soundtrack -- 13 tracks total About: Requiescence is a visual novel - a 2D narrative-based game that presents the user with important choices to alter the story's path. Primarily a story of action and adventure, Requiescence features three prominent romance routes that significantly change the later portions of the game. The game is also a BL (boy's love) game, which means both the main character and the love interests are male. If you're familiar with Nitro+CHiRAL games (Togainu no Chi, Lamento, DRAMAtical Murder, Sweet Pool), then you know how amazing a story can become when you mingle an epic adventure with intricate character relationships. Requiescence is heavily inspired by these games and aims for a similar style, while still putting a fresh twist on the BL genre.",
