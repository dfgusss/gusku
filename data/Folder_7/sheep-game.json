    "About the game": "Sheep Game is a couch based multiplayer game best played with 2, 3 or 4 people. The game features 4 fields to herd your sheep in. To win the game you need to win 3 rounds. To win a round you need to herd 3 sheep into the central pen and hold them there for 3 seconds. Controls are very simple, point the analogue stick in the direction you want your dog to run and it will follow your command. If you pick up a power up you can trigger it with the action button. Will you play defensive and block your opponents? Or will you become top dog by rounding up your sheep in record time using your speed and agility!? So go grab your friends and challenge them to some fast and frenzied sheep herding. Family friendly Sheep Game is a family friendly game to be enjoyed by young pups and old dogs alike. It is free from any violence or swearing. Best played with friends Whilst you can play on your own to sharpen your skills, Sheep Game is best played with friends gathered around. Up to four people can play head to head. Don't have four controllers? No problem, Sheep Game supports four players using two controllers. Simple controls but hard to master Sheep Game is easy to pick up, you'll have your dog running around in no time, but keeping those sheep under control will take time to master. Break the deadlock with power ups Having trouble with your rivals? Use a well timed power up to freeze them in their tracks or give your self a speed boost to tip the balance. How to play Sheep Game requires game controllers, but there is some support for a keyboard.
