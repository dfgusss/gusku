This AOE ability can take out tight clusters of mobs, but beware, as he is fragile Explore the perilous land of Avericia and its wide variety of settings, including graveyards, dark forests, dungeons, crystal castles, magma caverns, and more... Over 50 stages across both chapters offers 3-4 hours of play time, and unlockable bonus challenges offer even more, if you just can't get enough Soulcaster. Join the fight, Mortal.
