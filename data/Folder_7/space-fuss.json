    "About the game": "This is arcade strategy, where you play as a space hobo, who had his cardboard box stolen. All gameplay is about balance (like rock-paper-scissors), unlocking pets and special abilities. Put right 'ingredients' on the battlefield and watch them fight. And if your robots losing - change strategy! Shoot enemy with special ability! Throw pet into the battle! Restart level and take another pet and abilities with you! - Unit defense. It's like tower defense, but with units - After completing the game you can continue playing in the endless survival mode - You can also play it with a friend - And in case you don’t have any friends, you can play against a bot and imagine that he is your friend",
