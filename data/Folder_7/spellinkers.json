    "About the game": "A turn based strategy game, with some flavour of tower defense, RPG and luck games. But mostly a fun challenge! You are a summoner and war mage commander! Be a master of fire, water, wind and earth while commanding mages and spellinkers of each element to defeat great armies of hommunculi. Build your strategy over a randomly generated field of elemental tiles; you never know how the next battle will be. Cast spells or make powerful linked attacks with your units to defeat tons of enemies! Get stronger with each battle while chasing the mad villain Midas through the world to recover the stolen Philosopher's Stone. The mages of the Ivory Tower are counting on you!",
