Known as the SIN (Synthetic Intelligence Network). The megalomaniac AI gone mad is sending hoards of star ships in regular attacks against earth. You must assemble a group of four ships to cut through the hoard (Using your math skills) to defeat the mainframe controlling them! You will need to fight through a huge 100 area procedural saga map to defeat 9 boss ships, before you can square up to the mainframe in the final battle! Key features include: * Use your math skills to attack the enemy ships with the four basic functions( / * - + ) and many other special math functions in turn based combat! * No time limits! Its about using numbers well and tactically, you can take your time to think about your moves. * Massive deep adventure with hundreds of randomly generated missions that last from 5 to 30 minuets each. * Huge roster of space ships to unlock and upgrade all with their own attributes and abilities. * Lots of medals and upgrades to unlock. * This game is intended to challenge teens and adults, but has a Kids mode and Baby mode for young children and learners. * Lots of interesting math functions to use such as; prime numbers, factorials and square route.
