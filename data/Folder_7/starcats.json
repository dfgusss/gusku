    "About the game": "Four cats have broken out of prison on a distant alien planet. They must steal a ship and escape before their suits run out of power. If only they could decide who should be captain. Work with and against your cohorts to become the captain, commandeer a new ship, and escape. Key Features Cooperation is a strategy, not a requirement. Make temporary allies, break promises, and watch out for backstabbers. 2-4 player local multiplayer Procedurally generated maps Cats! (in both corporeal and spectral forms) Strategy You'll have to work together if you want to survive! Four generators need to be activated to power the ship, and you can't do it alone. At the same time, players who survive get points so if you want to win you'll have to get creative. Beautiful Landscapes Explore randomly generated landscapes every time you crash. Navigate distinct and vibrant biomes on your hunt for generators and gold. Tools of Disruption Collect gold to buy items between rounds, ranging from vine traps that lock players in place to giant hammers that launch nearby players away. If you're lucky you might even be able to scavenge items from around the map. Life After Death Even after you've been killed you can still put up a fight. Control the spectre of your cat after death, sapping energy from other players and scaring them to death!",
