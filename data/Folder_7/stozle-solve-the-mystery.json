By solving one puzzle you can read 1 part of the story. Solve all the 9 puzzles inside the chosen story so you can read all the 10 pages of the story and find out the mystery. Story 1: A story about a small village where it is forbidden to go to the other side of the bridge. It is where the dead live. Everyone should respect their home. But there is one curious girl who doesn't listen to the leaders of the village... Story 2: A misterious error signal was sent from the planet Kahloon. A four member team of the MIROX (an inter-galactic mining company) have to travel and find out what happened. It won't be an easy mission however because the planet is full of unknown deadly creatures hiding in the swamps. Will everyone get back safely? Story 3: Are you satisfied with your life? Satisfied with what you have right now? Is it enough for you just being a regular fork? On one boring morning Ferine the fork had enough thinking that there is more in life than just the everyday repetitive sticking. This is where its journey begins.",
