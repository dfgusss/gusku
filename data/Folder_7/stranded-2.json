    "About the game": "JimJams games are a small, indie development team with a love for the retro games of the '80s and '90s. We only develop games that embrace that era, aiming to provide true classicly styled gaming, with a massive retro feel, maybe with a slight hint of what these games would have been with a little more processing power. We don't aim to develop AAA games, but simply to bring our passion for a time gone by to those who love truly classic themed and inspired games. If this is a genre and era that you love, then our games are for you. STRANDED 2 Following a not highly unexpected crash landing (which seems to happen to you a lot), you find yourself stranded on a hostile alien world full of humour, mystery and quite a bit of walking - Your task is clear, find a way off of this planet and get home. - Should be simple! As a text-adventure, you will control your actions and that of other characters, not with single keypresses or controllers, but through typed English sentences, In Stranded 2, you'll solve puzzles, and mysteries, through the manipulation of a host of objects, exploration and interaction with others you'll meet along the way. Features. Advanced language parsing. Numerous and entertaining text-based puzzles. A rich, and in-depth world, full of mystery. Many hours of game-play. Full English language manual to help you get started. A true taste of classic gaming. INCLUDES STRANDED - The original ZX SPECTRUM game.",
