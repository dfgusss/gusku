Fight the hordes of Minix, upgrade your powerful warlocks, choose your pet and hat wisely, tame an epic dragon, and travel the three continents of the world in the search of your Evil Witch Sisters! Supermagical takes classic puzzle mechanics, adds a generous serving of RPG Sauce (organic and gluten free) and goes onto heights you have not seen before on a game of this genre! STORY. Join Nina, the misfit witch student, in a fun magical adventure that will take you on a trip through 3 different continents full of puzzles, spells, and... Minix? Minix are magic-eating little creatures who have invaded Nina's world along with her Evil Witch sisters. Now you have no choice but to use your magic powers to send them all packing if you want to save the day! FEATURES. - 3 unique continents to explore, with a total of 71 different levels and minigames, hidden bonuses, and bosses.

(During the LAUNCH PERIOD ONLY you get a free copy of the album that's been remastered for the first time!). - 6 powerful warlocks will be at your command from your Magic Tower to fight the Minix. Combine their powers, upgrade them and watch the Minix run! - Get all the money you can to buy cool artifacts to help you win your battles. - Find all the different hats and pets for Nina and discover their magic advantages. - Buy all the ingredients and cook the four Ultramagic Spells that will help you in your quest. - Colorblind Mode included.
