    "About the game": "++ Tennis Fighters requires a controller in order to play. ++ NEW CONCEPT GAME Tennis Fighters is a whole new game genre where mixes a Tennis game &amp; Fighting game. You will find a great tennis game with the action &amp; effects of a fighting game (like health bar, power bar, special shots, etc…) The mechanics are simple, more points you do, more damage you make to your opponent. GAMEPLAY Our goal is to create a funny, competitive and depth gameplay. Tennis Fighters has the perfect balance between Simulation &amp; Arcade style. With the intuitive control shot system, you can choose the power, direction and curve of every shot in the game, converting every match with a skill based challenge. By winning points, aces or breakpoints you will earn “Fighter Energy”, and when the bar is full you will be able to do the 'Super Shots' (shots with top power and perfect accuracy). SINGLEPLAYER: ACADEMY Our goal is to make game with the perfect balance between sim &amp; arcade, but we noticed that several players don't know how to play or just don't know how to make all the shots. So we created an 'Academy' where you will find tutorials and 'lessons' to complete in order to learn and know how to play the game (shots, movements, etc...) Our intention is to keep adding more lessons, so we are waiting for your feedback. SINGLEPLAYER: WORLD TOUR This offline mode is an 'arcade mode' where you will play against all the Fighters in the game in a random way (court/daytime) and once you will win all, you will be the champion. Each round has a 'chrono', so be sure to beat all your opponent in the less time as possible to be the one in the 'world raking'. MULTIPLAYER: ONLINE* Play against others players around the world in a online ranked matches (1P vs 1P). Be the number 1 in the world! MULTIPLAYER: OFFLINE* With the training mode you can train your skills with the 'AI'. In order to improve your skills you can customize AI difficult to be sure you are comfortable with the level. Once you are ready, you can go to the online matches. Also you can play against the “Robot”, an special character difficult to win. OPTIONS* You can change the cameras, the courts, the daytime, the 'ai level', the sensibility of the aim system, the sounds, the music, the crowd... Make your game like you want to play.
