Mirror match - Two players are receiving identical figures. Speed-up your opponent - when a line is completed, opponent's game speed is doubled until they complete their own line. Cooperation Modes Control swap - Each turn players swap their controls. Balanced wells - Heights of both wells are balanced, so that each player gets about the same amount of empty space. Single well - Play together in the same big well. Heart-shaped well - Play together in the wells with the shared bottom. Controls Play with a single keyboard or with a keyboard+controller. Press [esc] to exit Press [space] to pause Only a single controller is supported, as I have only one controller at home and can't test it for two.",
