After some disturbances in his neighborhood, Dan went to his local community's T.H.A.R.N. Facility (Tactical Human Assisted Research Network) to file a complaint. After being in a waiting room for hours, Dan decides to try to leave, but must face the labyrinth of the T.H.A.R.N. to do so. Players must try their best to solve puzzles, crack combinations, unlock doors, smash things, and even hack a computer system all in an attempt to escape the facility.",
