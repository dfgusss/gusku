    "About the game": "Welcome to The Concourse , a highly competitive racing game that forces players to literally think on their feet to conquer randomly generated tracks &amp; obstacles. Take the lead from your foes with energy attacks designed to disrupt their flow and concentration. After every race is completed, the winner chooses a modifier to apply to the subsequent races. Increase speed for everyone, permanently invert controls, decrease the effectiveness of the energy attacks or reset everything to the defaults. Every race you play will be a unique experience. Are you up to the challenge? Step into The Concourse and prove what you're made of! Some of our current features: Intense racing action mixed with split second decision making Ever changing tracks and flag locations means you will never play the same level twice With community feedback we'll take an already fun and challenging game to new heights Energy Attacks that invert controls, stop your opponents in their tracks or cause them to slide uncontrollably. A shield that allows you to absorb incoming energy attacks and punish your assailants AI opponents All DLC and updates for The Concourse will be FREE Including but not limited to: Full game pad support Character customization and diversity is a planned future addition Split screen local multiplayer Potential community suggested add-ons",
