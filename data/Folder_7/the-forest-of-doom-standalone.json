    "About the game": "Only the foolhardy would risk an encounter with the unknown perils that lurk in the murky depths of Darkwood Forest. Yet there is no alternative, for your quest is a desperate race against time to find the missing pieces of the legendary Hammer of Stonebridge – fashioned by Dwarfs to protect the villagers of Stonebridge against their ancient doom. Computer gaming was in its infancy and it was the early days of tabletop RPGs when Ian Livingstone's The Forest of Doom exploded into bookshops in the early 80s, proudly displaying Iain McCaig’s iconic cover. Relive the adventures in Darkwood Forest, lovingly updated for PC, Mac and Linux. Presented in full colour with realistic physics-based dice rolling for battles, auto-mapping, an auto-updated adventure sheet and stat keeping. This Standalone edition of The Forest of Doom gamebook comes specially themed to suit the adventure. The Forest of Doom is also available to purchase within the Fighting Fantasy Classics library . Please note that purchasing one does not unlock the other and will need to be re-purchased if desired in the other format.",
