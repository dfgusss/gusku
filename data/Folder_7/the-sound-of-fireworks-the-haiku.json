    "About the game": "Hey new journal, My old journal ran out of pages, so you're holding the fort now. Let me introduce myself! My name is Amimi Imai, I'm 18, and most of my friends call me 'Hanabi'. Why? Well, I'm a big fan of fireworks! My mom loved them, and the way she always talked about them made me want to see them for myself. But you know, life happens, and I haven't had the chance to see them in person. Well...not yet at least, but we'll get to that. This year has been a doozy: I had to move to a new city for family reasons, had to leave my friends behind, and we could only communicate through our phones. Major bummer. But I had a new school and new experiences to look forward to! I had big plans to do my best and get into the best university so I could follow my dreams of being a writer. But school can be like life sometimes: hard, cruel, and unwelcoming. I knew if I just put my head down, I would get through it somehow. But that all changed, when a certain dumb, uncoordinated, but amazing guy found his way to me. Him and his haikus. You'll get what I mean. Well, I gotta run, but I'll talk to you soon! Bye-bye! -Amimi~ The Sound of Fireworks: The Haiku is the first part of a (hopeful) trilogy following the friendships, hardships, and path of Amimi, an 18 year old student who's recent move from home has left her succumbed to a new high school and new life without the friends she's had by her side. But as a few weeks pass by, Amimi gets to know Uta, another student recently transferred living the same issues that Amimi is going through. While the chemistry is, well, off to say the least, a budding friendship is soon to be made, and Amimi's high school life will change: like the night sky from the bang of a Firework. &gt; Part 1 of The Sound of Fireworks Trilogy, TSOF: The Haiku is a single path/ending visual novel about love, acceptance, and a good ol' awkward budding teenage friendship.
