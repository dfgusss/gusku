    "About the game": "===About=== On a snowy mountain, in a wooden hut. With the girl I love most. She's the one for me, I'm the only one for her too. Even if it hurts, we can't be separated. ===Story=== The sciences of genetics and pharmacology advance inexorably. A new area of study emerges in this rampant progress: A method by which one may be made to love another. I and Fluffy are the beneficiaries of this technique. An enforced couple, too close to pull ourselves apart. No matter how much we hurt each other, we always forgive. Is this free affection, or confined love? Is it manipulated desire, or two souls taken away? It's all up to you. Features Achievement system. Multiple endings. Complete three ending to unlock extra story. ===Characters=== 【Fluffy】 The person I love, and she who loves me back. We are as siblings, but unrelated by blood. She is cute, naïve, and jumpy like a rabbit. Although she’s in college, she still behaves like a child. Because of genetic editing, She can only love me as I can only love her. 【Professor】 Our guardian whose age is unknown. She likes to do things that people can't understand. She is hot-blooded and tactlessly blunt. She has earned Fluffy's fear and my frustration. 【Snow】 A beautiful scholar and loner by nature. She never had an interest in love. But due to pressure, she had to give herself up. Her all goes to a monster. Thank 冬天de细语 (NaCeel) and G for the translation.",
