    "About the game": "UBERMOSH is a fast-paced arcade series that started in 2015 and was shaped by the amazing community's feedback each new volume. The 5th volume shows the Blade Saint 1200 years after the events of the first game with a set of new powers and more aggressive antagonists. Double your physical strikes, combo the Melter/Shield with the Brainclap and Manastrike of the previous volumes, fight smarter versions of the classic foes and go Hardboiled for a visceral reflex polish.",
