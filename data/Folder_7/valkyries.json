    "About the game": "Ateon. Gaia created this land so that she could live with her children. As time passed, an unknown evil blemished it all. Thus, Gaia disavowed the disobedient humans and abandoned the world she created. From that day on, she was referred to as “Terra”. Without a primary ruler to oversee her children, Ateon soon fell into chaos and the First Valkyrian War was recorded in history. The Valkyrie were sacred creatures that would fuse themselves with warriors, imbuing the chosen ones with fantastic powers to defeat true evil. From the ashes of war, the Kingdom of Rose was born. The tenacious people sought to unite the world under one rule. They aimed their blades at any who would go against them. Purging the world of imperfections in hopes that it will summon Terra back to their world. Centuries later, in pursuit of absolute perfection, the Kingdom of Rose continued its conquest. Emperor Tobias Rosenthal developed a ruthless system to breed out all disobedience. The youth were the main target. If any blemish was found on a student, they would be purged. As more and more lands were conquered, the Way of the Rose also spread, creating a vast utopia under strict enforcement. As we begin our story, Ascanius Rosenthal races towards school. With death used as a constant reminder, one would imagine students would take great care to arrive to their class way ahead of schedule. However, for Ascanius, his uncanny ability to survive by the narrowest of margins impedes his decision making. Especially when it comes to extra sleep. Built by the support of Fans Four Character Routes (July 2018)",
