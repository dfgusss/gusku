    "About the game": "The year is 2026. Vedette is a new anti-crime task force being tested in the city of Osteria. You are taking your position as judge and jury to send individuals to jail. The only resources at your disposal are the individuals’ emails, search history, and criminal backgrounds. You must determine whether or not the individual is guilty or innocent, whether to arrest or ignore them. If you make too many mistakes, this task force -even this city- may not last long. In this futuristic-dystopian investigation game, you will have to decide the fate of the citizens of Osteria. If you arrest or ignore the wrong people, you may end up destroying the city you are sworn to protect. You will be shown character profiles one by one, using deductive reasoning to come to a conclusion on guilt, then choose either to arrest or ignore that person. After choosing one of the two options, you will be shown a new profile. This goes on until you have made a significant impact on the city, resulting in one of 9 possible endings.",
