Through our debut project VR Regatta - The Sailing Game, we bring entertainment and education together through virtual reality (VR). We create experiences to enable more people to sail through the creation of games, training experiences and more. 'I believe virtual reality can greatly enhance sailing training, be a great way for all ‘landlocked’ sailors to stay connected to their hobby and introduce more people to sailing,' Greg Dziemidowicz, Co-Founder of MarineVerse 'What excites me about VR Regatta is how it can be used in an educational setting. For those who have never been sailing before, using VR Regatta allows them to learn the basics and put them into practice without introducing any potentially dangerous elements. This approach will give them confidence to take the next step in their sailing, whether it’s as a recreational or competitive sailor.' Stu Gilfillen, Director of Education, US Sailing 'VR Regatta is an exciting new development for the sport of sailing. We have utilised this technology as part of our Discover Sailing offerings at a number of events including the Australian Grand Prix, The Volvo stopover and Club opening and Discover Sailing Days. It has proven to be a successful platform to introduce new people to the sport of sailing in conjunction with real life on water experiences,' Gavin Wall, Manager at Australian Sailing",
