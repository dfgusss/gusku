    "About the game": "A war is coming between Man and Myth. A war which will rage across the world and wreak terrible devastation. Witness how it starts! This is a reading adventure where you make choices to help the protagonist of each chapter survive to the end, so they can live on to impact the coming war. At the same time, the wrong choices offer their own rewards as they lead you down paths that explore more of the characters and the lore. No choice leads to a plot-line that is irrelevant and inconsequential, which means that though there are wrong choices, there are no bad ones. Hours worth of reading. Experience the start of a war between Man and Myth from four different, unique points of view. Play with Edwards, ex-SEAL operative now working for the Secret Service, and help her survive the very first contact with vampires. Play with Joseph, European king of Vampires, as he strives to convince all the other races and tribes of myths to come together, and wage war on Humanity. Play with McKenzy, SAS officer, as he stumbles into the very first real battle with werewolves. Play with Santiago, Navy SEAL officer, and help him survive the very first day of the war. Achievements reward every story branch exploration, can you find them all? You can configure your reading experience by manipulating the volume of the reading music as well as the automatic typing of the text. Look for the perfect ending, avoid that final disappointing sentence: 'things could have gone better'.",
