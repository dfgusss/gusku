Perhaps… but I can always hope for change to be just around the corner!…” Sveta is a young bank intern. She believes that there is no end to the cycle of monotony that has become her life; secretly wishing for change but is too depressed to find the motivation. Vlad is an unsociable, devil-may-care freelancer without any respect for the status quo who prefers to work alone. They find their lives turned upside-down when they are forced to work together on an urgent, high-profile project that could change the course of their careers. Can they work together despite their differences? Will this relationship change their lives for the better? Features: A visual novel with an old-school style – take a trip back to the 80’s with ASCII-art! Music by Sergey Eybog, compositor of “Everlasting Summer” – a compilation of chiptune-style melodies that complement the vibe of the game. ”Less than 1MB for download?!” Winter Novel has been made in pure C – just like how they were in the good old days. 30-60 minutes of gameplay – a game for the visual novel fans and curious casual gamers alike!",
