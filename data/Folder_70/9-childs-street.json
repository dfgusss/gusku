    "About the game": "9 Childs Street is a first-person indie horror game in the walking simulation genre, the main emphasis is on the scary atmosphere and the sense of fear of the player. During the passage, you will have to face paranormal phenomena and learn the terrifying mystery of the owner of the house. The setting is a house across the street, in which, not so long ago, lived an elderly lonely man, but he is no longer seen and the house lights no longer come on. You play as a curious 9 year old boy named 'Armin who was wondering what happened to his neighbor and one night he saw a light in the seemingly already abandoned house across the street. Without thinking long, he took a flashlight and went to investigate the sinister house in secret from his parents. Why did it feel as if someone was watching from a corner? Why do his eyes look so alive? Walkthrough of the game ~50 minutes. Warning! There are flashes of light in this game.",
