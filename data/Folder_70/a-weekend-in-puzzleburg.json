    "About the game": "A Weekend in Puzzleburg is a cozy slice-of-life role-playing game with over 180,000 ways your weekend vacation can play out. No need to fight monsters or save the world from impending doom - you've merely booked a relaxing weekend getaway in a town known for its puzzles. Welcome to Puzzleburg! All around town, each person needs your help with something, if you can first puzzle out what item they need and where to find that item. So in between reading a book, taking a selfie of the town's welcome sign, or any other vacation activity you get up to, see how many random acts of kindness you can fit in. Because you can take a break from your workaday life, but one should never take a break from being kind to others. With A Weekend in Puzzleburg , you're not buying a video game - you're buying a whole vacation. One that you can play over and over again whenever you want, getting new experiences each time. All that for under $20 'Open-Town' Rather Than 'Open-World' Experience an 'open-world' game set in a cozy resort town. Get to know the townspeople, and you'll soon find your way around like a local Experience The Joys of Traveling A new town means a new you. Define your character's backstory, get your hair dyed a crazy color, or even get a hint from the hotel concierge if you ever get stuck on a puzzle. Anything goes while on vacation Simple Controls, Complex Characters Immerse yourself in deep, character-driven quest lines that rely on brainpower, not how fast you can press buttons. Supports controllers or keyboard + mouse, or if you want a point-and-click adventure game feel, try going mouse-only Short and Sweet The free demo is about 30 minutes, and the full game is about 2-4 hours for a single playthrough, making it ideal for completing in a weekend, much as the game title suggests (though multiple playthroughs are of course encouraged). All the while, everyone around Puzzleburg is as friendly as can be Quotes from actual playtesters 'Really strong Schitt's Creek vibes' 'A perfect plane game for Steam Deck' [a game great for playing on-the-go, such as on a flight] 'I like a game that makes my character take a mid-day nap' For reference, here are some similar games to help you get a further sense for what A Weekend in Puzzleburg is like: A Short Hike, Earthbound, Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, To The Moon, Wayward Strand, Life is Strange, Nancy Drew, Professor Layton, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Bugsnax, and Suikoden",
