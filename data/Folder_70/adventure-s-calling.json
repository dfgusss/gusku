    "About the game": "Travel the world, study, and test your geography skills by flying around in your house held afloat by balloons! Test your skills by exploring the world with two different modes: normal and aviation . In normal mode, you fly with a top down view, and can see almost half the earth at any given time. In aviation mode, you can test your skills as if your were a pilot, seeing only a narrow view of the earth and seeing countries from far more obscure angles. Study by flying around the world with country labels, and even find the shortest path to the country. Check your progress by monitoring the Atlas to see which country locations you are particularly strong strong at, and which need some work. Play with your friends and compete to get the highest score on the leaderboard! I hope you enjoy my passion project, which involved figuring out the best ways to 3D model the planet to make a beautiful experience! I know some of the datasets containing country data might be slightly outdated, so please leave feedback and I will do my best to adjust the numbers. Thank you!",
