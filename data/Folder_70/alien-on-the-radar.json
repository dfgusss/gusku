    "About the game": "Arena, cat-and-mouse game between marines and aliens. Playing as Marine Marine tries to discover alien's location and destroy its eggs as soon as possible.                    When the top time runs out, marines win.                    The closer marine gets to an alien, the more precise they see alien's position. *Detection improves with time. *Only the closest alien gets detected.                    When a marine stops for a while, they discover alien spawns.                    Marine uses item maker to get machine gun ammo, or time speed-up. *Chosen item can't be changed until item maker gets broken. Playing as Alien Alien tries to create breeders which then flood marines with minions. When a marine run out of machine gun ammo, an alien itself can finish the job.                    Mid-game, alien grows and gains a regenerating (yellow) life.                    Alien knows what marines see. Red icon means the marine sees alien. *Bullets hurt alien even when it's not visible.                                       Alien lays eggs. Small egg (left) is undetectable. A big egg (middle) becomes an alien spawn (right): minion (top) attacks marines. artillery (middle) shoots item makers. breeder (bottom) creates minions. The longer it lives, the stronger are minions it creates. Alien spawns are invisible until a marine stops near them.                    Artillery shoots item makers. *When the artillery bullet hangs over the target, It becomes visible to the marines. *When no item maker in range, artillery shoots marines.                    When alien breaks an item maker, they gain some time. Other Features Multiplayer and single player AI Bots Chat and voting to kick players                    When a character dies, they stay inside game with blacked graphics and skull icon, they can't shoot or attack. *Hurt marine can still detect spawns (at smaller range). *Hurt alien can still leave tracks.",
