    "About the game": "Game Features: A unique combat system - unconventional movement that rewards precise aiming and mastery over strategy, patience, and quick thinking. KO enemies with melee attacks, stomp them for ammunition, use that newfound ammo to shred through enemies with a variety of interesting bullet types. Switch between Demon and Angel mode for unique additions to combat and exploration. A short but sweet horror adventure through the depths of an apocalyptic wasteland. Monstrous Boss Battles to test your limits, barely scrape through with your limbs still attached… hopefully. Explore a vile and beautiful interconnected world. Story: The Brothers Heathcliff and Locke invent a weapon of mass destruction, The Gear. This mechanical disease devours matter, digesting said matter into more of itself. I.E. It is a self replicating machine that uses every living and nonliving thing as a fuel source. A universe is eaten in it’s entirety. In a desperate gambit for more fuel, The Gear invades another dimension, The Godhead. You are a Soldier, unwillingly drafted into a horrible conflict. At the height of battle, a monster is born from the moon. The Gear is unleashed in the Godhead, and now it’s on you to fix it. Untangle the Web of how The Gear came to be. Meet ghoulishly endearing characters who will help you on your journey. Grow closer with them through sidequests. End the nightmare of The Gear, once and for all!",
