    "About the game": "Back Rank Chess is a brand new chess variant. It is very easy to learn. You must protect the back rank against an onslaught of enemy pawns. The pawns are controlled by an advanced chess engine that will outsmart you many times! You win by capturing all the enemy pawns before they reach the back rank. If any pawn touches the back rank, you lose. The game features THREE modes of difficulty - BEGINNER, AMATEUR and EXPERT. There are 66 hand-crafted stages, each titled and designed for a unique experience. Watch out - the Expert stages might kick your butt !",
