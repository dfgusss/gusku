    "About the game": "Summary: Shoot banana limbs off and watch their ragdoll bodies fall then cook their delicious remains over the fire and feed it to your cute little fox! Gameplay: - 2 Levels are available (difference between levels is time limit and difficulty) - A horde of banana men will spawn and attack the player - 2 Weapons can be used by the player to kill the banana men (axe + gun) - Score can be increased by cooking the remains of the banana men and feeding it to your little fox (don't over or under cook it!) - Make sure to increase your score while maintaining your HP within the time limit to win! That's it! It is a very simple game. Please note that the game does NOT have any save system. Developer Note: This game was made as a university project, but has since been polished a tiny bit and released on Steam for whoever wants to give it a go! Don't expect a triple A polished game, this game was developed out of passion and pure love for gaming, and is meant to serve as a fun little silly game to play when you just want to mess around and kill silly banana looking enemies :D",
