    "About the game": "Isaiah leads a boring life in the United States, taking care of his sickly older sister. Struggling to support the both of them, he comes home from work one day to find something strange at his front door... This game is a dark, short, and gritty narrative experience that consists of other, smaller games. At times, it's a turn-based JRPG. At times, it's a boxing game. You may think of it as a short story in video game form. Features include a variety of graphical perspectives and an original soundtrack made by me. While the gameplay is not meant to be challenging, there will be moments in which the player can lose. Please expect about an hour of playtime, and a dramatic story with one ending.",
