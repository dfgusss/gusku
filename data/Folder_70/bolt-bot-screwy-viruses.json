    "About the game": "CLASSIC PLATFORMING FUN! Take control of a robot named Bolt in over 50 levels of 3D platforming fun inspired by classic platform games. It is a collect-a-thon at heart and rewards the player constantly in an evolving hub world! Collecting all the scrap in two levels next to each other will unlock a bonus level, which plays a bit differently to the main levels. STEAM DECK COMPATIBILITY 100% Playable! After clicking start with the touch screen or touch-pad Bolt Bot is fully playable from start to finish. Cloud Saves Unfortunately, cloud saves are not possible. The game started development without steam deck in mind, so please choose either the PC or Steam Deck for your playthrough. STORY Two shops are fighting for customers on the same street. One is called Bolt's Bit's and Bot's and the other is Mr Coin's Treasure Cove. When the evil Mr Coin realizes Bolt's shop is doing more business than his, he releases a virus which infects all of Bolt's products. Bolt then has to enter each one of his toy like models and repair everything inside to increase his store rating! TOOLS AND UPGRADES Bolt is both a skilled mechanic and inventor, so he has many different tools and contraptions at his disposal, such as a spanner to fix things with and a whip to reach higher locations. His trusty sky wing also makes an appearance, so that he can safely glide back to the ground. These aids only appear in certain levels which creates a unique puzzle platform challenge in every level. BIT'S AND BOT'S The main hub world in the game is called Bit's and Bot's. Every collectible found in each level of the game is tied to it. The more you collect, the more the shop becomes alive! Scrap Scrap can be traded with Mr Coin for an extra Microchip. Microchips Microchips are the main beating heart of the shop. They power up display stands, unlock music tracks, give Bolt new paint schemes and unlock bonus levels. Viruses Viruses have infected Bolt's products and need to be removed. Removing every single one from a product will reward you with a shiny collectible card, which can be viewed from one of the stores many card display stands. Coins Coins can be used to hire Mr Coins staff members for your own shop. Controller Support Playable with a Mouse and Keyboard or with the Xbox Controller.",
