    "About the game": "In Broombot Battlegrounds, you and up to three other players take control of cute, customizable home cleaning robots. Each state-of-the-art Broombot model has been carefully modified for maximum battle-capability -- in other words, we strapped knives, forks, and whatever other dangerously pointy household items we could find to the top of them. The objective of the game is simple: use your chosen weapon to pop your opponent's dust balloon (located on their hind-quarters) before they can pop yours! Our Broombots also have a variety of maneuverability options at their disposal! Players will need to jump, dash and drift across 14 themed maps and 3 intense gamemodes in order to prove themselves as the ultimate cleaning machine. Dress to kill! Personalize your Broombot with over 30 unique unlockable cosmetic items. Choose from a wide arsenal of weapons, decals, and Broombot models to make the cleaning robot of your dreams! Spice up your battles with a dash of CHAOS! Hunt for hidden Power-Up Balloons and pop them with your weapon to receive one of eight special abilities , from conjuring a powerful vortex that sweeps enemies away to pulling out a literal flippin' handgun. Broombot Battlegrounds has 3 unique competitive gamemodes to choose from! CLEAN OF THE HILL Dust as far as the eye can see -- a Broombot's dream come true! In this special split-screen gamemode, vacuum up dust and return it to your docking stand for points, but be careful! The more dust you collect, the bigger your dust balloon will get. If your dust bag gets popped, any goodies you collected will spill out, allowing opponents to swoop in and steal it! TIMED DEATHMATCH It's pop or be popped! The more player's balloons you pop, the more points you get. End up on top before the timer reaches zero! LAST BOT STANDING Only one Broombot can be crowned the victor! Destroy or outlast your opponents by any means necessary. The player who wins a set amount of matches will take the crown. Set levels to cycle between rounds for added craziness!",
