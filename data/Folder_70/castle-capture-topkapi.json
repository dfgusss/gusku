The Crusaders, the ironfist of the western civilizations summoned against common foes in order to secure control of holy sites considered sacred. Crusades successfully extended the reach of Western civilization, brought wealth, heightened interest in learning and paved the way for the Renaissance. Many Europeans joined crusades to be forgiven for past sins, to get land overseas, to see the world, or to have an adventure and prove their bravery. The Ottomans, a Turkish Tribe established in 1299, quickly grew into a large empire. With is highly disciplined and fearless infantry along with well-educated and intelligent officers, they became fearsome among the rivals of their time. The lastest encounter between the Crusaders and Ottomans took place in 1699.",
