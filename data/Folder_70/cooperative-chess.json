If you've read this far, you must want some feature details Customizable difficulty Single-player mode if you want to learn in a safe place (or if that's just your thing) Avatar customization unlocked by completing achievements Private games with friends Quality of life improvements beyond what's normal for Chess apps Cooperative Chess is part of what has retroactively been termed a 'molasses jam' run by the Bay Area Dev Collective .

The other molasses game jam games are also on steam: / / /",
