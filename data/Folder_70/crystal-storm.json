    "About the game": "Crystal Storm is a game that mixes the survival that comes from mining and resource management with the action of twin stick shooters and roguelikes. This is my first commercial game so i hope you like it, this is what the game is about. The game features a progression system where you, the main wizard use the power of gems and crystals to get spells and get stronger on every aspect of the mechanics involving the game, and you will need them, because sooner than later your beloved fortress will be swarmed by all kinds of monsters. Search for hidden relics underground to unlock their powers and gain access to gadgets and even more magical power to aid you in your quest. After every run you will gain essence which you use to unlock characters with different abilities and styles of combat. Crystal Storm is the action that comes from enemies swarming up from all sides and the power you get acess to from mining crystals which unlock skills. Time is also your enemy because every new wave will be more difficult, it will spawn more kinds of enemies and they will have an increase of stats (Speed / Damage / Health) The game is a mix of these elements in an action roguelike with many kinds of enemies (Flying/Ground/Underground/Supportive) with different behaviour and a boss or two. The skill tree is unlocked via the magic cauldron that your character has and when you deposit the crystals found underground you use these to buy upgrades which increase the stats of your character and its weapon, and even unlocking new abilities. The goal of the game is to search for the 3 relics of the planet and when you deposit a relic you can choose one of the gadgets in the game.",
