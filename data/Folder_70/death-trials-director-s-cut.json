    "About the game": "DEATH TRIALS is a disturbing horror game from Made in America Media, LLC. It is a story about kidnapping, scientific trials gone wrong, and a dark group of cultists burying all of their research. Plenty of jump-scares and perfect for streaming! You wake up in total darkness in a rusty metal cage. After you escape it, you notice the room you're in smells like rotten flesh and death. In this labyrinth of corpses and blood, you must find a way to escape... before they come for you. Face the horrors buried deep within this God forsaken testing facility. Voices echo through the halls. Maybe there's survivors, or maybe you're all alone. You can't shake that intense feeling of danger. Something feels like it's coming. Will you run and hide, or fight to escape? . . . You're helpless without a weapon. You need to find a weapon NOW. Whoever kidnapped you might come back soon, and you need to be ready. Maybe it's not just one kidnapper. This looks like some kind of human trafficking organization. You're bleeding , which means you're leaving a trail of blood. Which means you can't hide forever. The AI will eventually start following your tracks. You need to use whatever you can help you escape this labyrinth of insanity. If you find a weapon, be ready to fight at any moment! But beware! Can you escape in time before you're trapped in this hell forever? Hack and slash your way through the facility with a trusty axe you find. Destroy monsters one by one, or get overrun and die quickly. Find loose notes and pages of forgotten experiments and the scribblings of tortured victims. Find out the truth behind this organization. Survive to tell the tale... . . . How to Play: (Make sure to apply cool filters in SETTINGS.) W,A,S,D to move. CTRL to crouch. SHIFT to run. SPACE to jump. E to interact. TAB for inventory.
