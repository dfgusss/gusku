    "About the game": "Survive together, work together, trust no-one. Deliria is a 5vs1 horror game where a player is chosen at random to play the role of a brutal Hunter. The remaining Survivors must first deduce who the Hunter is, and then escape a fate worse than death. SURVIVE THE MATCH The Survivors goal is to progress through the randomly selected map, refuel multiple sets of Generators that allow Survivors to progress. When Survivors reach the final area of the map, they must open a hatch to escape. During the match both Survivors are encouraged to scavenge for supplies and open Chests to find useful items to aid them on their objectives. HUNT YOUR FRIENDS The Hunters objective is much simpler, eliminate all of the Survivors, no matter the cost. Whether you prefer a stealthy and deceiving approach or charging head on at them with brute force, all ways of play are welcomed and catered for.
