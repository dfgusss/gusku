Dive into the unique class and dungeon stew that’s on today’s menu and whet your appetite for the full game, one daily dungeon bite at a time. You’ll need to explore, strategize, test your skills, plan your approach to heal your hero, and obliterate bloodthirsty enemies to emerge victorious with a hoard of treasure. DAILY Challenge - This demo will refresh with a new dungeon and throw a new class at you every day. That’s right! Every single day you’ll get a chance to get rich… or die trying! DAILY Rewind - Eating dirt already? Lay down your burdens and try again (you only get one shot so do not miss your chance to blow!) DAILY Demo Leaderboard - Achieve eternal glory and rise to the top of the daily leaderboard, compare your results, and prove to your friends that you are the ultimate dungeon master! DAILY Healing by Exploring - Reveal hidden terrain to regain health and mana. But plan your route carefully or you’ll have nothing left to face the final enemy! Don't let your guard down, because one wrong move could be your last. The choice is yours - will you become a legendary dungeon crawler, or fall to the wayside?",
