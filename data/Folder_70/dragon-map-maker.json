    "About the game": "Dragon Map Maker is a new App in Early Access for creating grid-based battle maps for Tabletop Roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons, Path Finder, Call of Cthulhu etc. It makes maps you can use on Virtual Tabletops like Roll20, FoundryVTT, FantasyGrounds and MapTools or you can print them yourself to use at your table. (Note: it’s not a Virtual Table Top). This is the Indie Commercial License version of Dragon Map Maker. Check the EULA section 3.3 for further details. Main Features Dragon Map Maker has been specifically designed to create great-looking top-down rendered maps. While it's always nice to show flashy 3d shots of an app in use the most important thing is what the final maps look like! So check out the screenshots section. Make 10x10 to 100x100 5ft square battle maps Virtual Table Top map export using the .uvtt file format (FoundryVTT, Roll20 and any other Virtual Table Top that supports the Universal VTT file format) Two modes for optimum performance, Layout and Beauty mode. Paint organic natural biomes using the terrain layer masks (swamp, mud, sand, rocky, forest floor, trees etc) Paint special Biomes such as “snow cover” and “Underground” (see the caves and snow in the screenshots section) Paint height using the simple map grid that helps to easily integrate rooms and terrain onto the same map. Dragon Map Maker is designed to be easy to learn and use. Check the promo video for examples of many of these features in use!",
