    "About the game": "DUCK: Dangerous Ultimate Cartridge Kidnapper is a compilation of 100 very different microgames lasting less than a minute! Cowboy duel, house building, tomato sorting, barrel ride, sea battles, jungle adventures, typical daily life of a mad scientist and more! STORY . A group of ducklings finds a mysterious 100-in-1 cartridge that turns out to be a trap for an evil spirit who calls himself D.U.C.K. Now the ducklings will have to show all their gamer skills, or else the villain will fulfill the curse and make them characters in his games. Being two-dimensional and pixelated, constantly dying and being reborn, is an unenviable fate! FEATURES Variety. 15 categories of 5-10 microgames each with three difficulty levels, plus a separate category for boss games. Different styles of pixel graphics, lots of unique tunes and sounds. And even the playthrough can be interesting, because you never know what's going to happen! And finally—as you progress through the story mode, play through the games and fulfill special conditions, you can unlock all 16 decorative panels—arcade, Greek, comic, summer, brick and more! Game Modes. In story mode, the ducklings will definitely get through all 100 games with your help, 5 ducklings are 5 main chapters. Open games appear in the vault, where you can choose any of them and practice, pass on all difficulties. And finally, there is a survival mode—try to get the highest score! However… No one prevents you from plunging into the unknown with your friends by activating one of the party modes! The warm atmosphere of childhood. The spirit has locked the ducklings in a room in the house of a typical duckling of the time. Small cozy room, the rays of the setting sun streaming through the window, you and your friends gathered in front of the screen of a tubby TV, and in the console—a cartridge with a bunch of interesting games! Note: Cooperative are implemented in the form of a hotseat mode. This means that players must play in sequence, one after another.",
