    "About the game": "Duplicado is a charming and beautiful puzzle game that will relax and challenge you. Journey across a serene avocado orchard, planting trees as you solve your way through a vast number of deeply-engaging levels. It'll be easy for you to pick up and play, but you'll frequently find yourself puzzled as you progress through the three difficulty tiers. Duplicado levels are procedurally generated right on your device, which means that you have a practically-endless number of unique puzzles to discover! We hope this game offers peaceful little moments when you need them most. Happy puzzling :)",
