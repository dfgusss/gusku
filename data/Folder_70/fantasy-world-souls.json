    "About the game": "I had the idea of taking sprites from RPG Maker and animating them in an MMO, and even within a game where you can take care of monsters or humans. Even better, you can play co-op with your friends. This is the purpose of this game. How to connect? The account created here is not a Steam account, that is, it is independent of Steam. Create your account on the title screen by clicking 'signup'. There is no need to confirm EMAIL. You need to be connected to the internet to play the game. How to play coop(multiplayer)? First you must release the Vortex for the CO-OP option to be released, and then Also, you can play with your friends. To release the Vortex, you must beat the first dungeon called 'Ancient Ruins' Summary of story mode: Something goes wrong in creation and a cosmic battle ensues between spiritual beings. They fought for a sphere called 'Exferas Clestis', which would give unimaginable power to those who possessed it. The struggle was so intense that the veil between the spiritual and material world was torn apart and the sphere entered the material world. For some unknown reason the sphere broke into several upon falling into this material world. That's when a part fell near where the hero was, and with his curiosity he ended up possessing it and receiving some power. Now a spiritual Elder appears to him in visions and dreams and tells him the importance of preventing other beings from getting hold of the spheres. Each sphere that the hero gets throughout the story gives him capabilities such as: floating, breathing underwater, seeing spirits and so on.
