    "About the game": "The War of Echo is a card collection game. Players need to click on a map block in a map, encounter various monsters or events, obtain monsters, treasures or cards from it, form the strongest card group, and defeat the final Boss to win! Unique fighting style Compared with other card games, we have retained the traditional way of playing cards, but abandoned the round based fighting mode, achieved the real-time fighting mode, deleted many tedious operations, and made the fight more pure and extreme. Super card effect For the effect of cards, we have adopted a more exaggerated effect, so that cards have the effect of one card to set the world. In this way, when we fight, we can more reflect the player's card use strategy than luck. Unique monsters The monster effect in the game is colorful and unique. In order to allow players to match different card combinations, our set combination often requires a monster and several cards. In this way, we have several unique combinations in a card group, allowing players to play more freely and combine the desired card groups. Rich treasure system The treasure system can improve the monster's basic combat attributes, reasonably explore the map, and obtain various treasures to pave the way for the final fight with the Boss.",
