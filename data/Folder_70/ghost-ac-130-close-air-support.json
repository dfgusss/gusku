    "Release date": "Feb 23, 2023",
    "About the game": "Understand first that this is as of now a simple, mindless shooter with two endless levels. There is no story, no progression and no way to die (except shooting the friendlies). It's the kind of game you might want to play after a long day at work where you just want to just hunt people down and blow shit up. I want my players to know this going into it because if this doesn't sound like what you're looking for - please don't buy it. For me, satisfaction is paramount. You are the gunner of the AC-130 Gunship. One of the most lethal war machines ever made. Use your skill with thermal optics and three of the biggest and most lethal guns ever produced to stop the enemy cold- and without warning. A Simulation in its presentation with arcade-like gameplay. Three Types of Weapons on the AC-130 accurately recreated Take control of the three guns mounted on the AC-130 variant: a 25mm cannon, a 40mm cannon and a 105mm Howitzer. Use the 25mm cannon that shoots 200 rounds per minute and each round has the equivalent blast of a hand grenade. This is your first go-to to ferret out hiding enemies under trees or in the cover of a structure. Take control of the 40mm cannon to give yourself a less accurate but more lethal blast - especially if there are 2 or 3 enemies close together. And the 105mm Howitzer is capable of leveling the largest of structures in the game. White hot and black hot thermal imaging You will have complete control over what you see and how you see it, and because these missions take place under the cover of darkness you will have to utilize the embedded thermal imaging cameras that can sense human bodies through heat. It is a strategy to learn when to use white hot and when to use black hot. GHOST gives you that strategic opportunity to explore and discover the possibilities using either mode. Two Infinite Respawn Wave levels The game in it's current state has two Infinite Respawn Wave levels where you are scored and the enemies continue to respawn. You will find that White Hot Thermal and Black Hot Thermal have their distinct uses based on the geography of both levels. This mode is a more arcade experience of the game. Real audio of the crew of an AC-130 Gunship I have not attempted to recreate what the crew exchanges are like back and forth on my own because I wanted to give the player authenticity. Audio barks are taken from actual live and dangerous missions that have been flown by the Air Force. Addicting and seamless gameplay GHOST- AC-130 has been designed for ease of use even in its simulation state. It provides a quick and easy way to conquer the controls immediately so that there is no learning curve to have fun.",
