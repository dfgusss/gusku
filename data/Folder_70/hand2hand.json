    "About the game": "The Hand2Hand project is a fighting game... OF HANDS ! Use everyday object in everyday places out of boredom in epic battles between... yourself. Each item represents the weapon and the character using it ; we let the imagination go wild so everything is more epic. ☼ 4 classes ☼ 3 levels of AI ☼ 3 maps ☼ Local 1v1 ☼ Homemade musics &amp; graphics ☼ Lightweight (~30Mb) The game is currently in development, and a bunch of features are yet to come. Nonetheless, we are happy to leave the community a playable version which will evolve during the following years ! Controls ☼ Blue (left) Movement - YGHJ Neutral Attack - Q Heavy Attack - W Jump - E Toggle AI (debug) - B Switch Character (debug) - 3 Switch Stance (debug) - maj+3 ☼ Red (right) Movement - Arrows Neutral Attack - P Heavy Attack - O Jump - L Toggle AI (debug) - V Switch Character (debug) - 4 Switch Stance (debug) - maj+4 ☼ Miscellaneous Enable debug (hitbox, data) - D Increase FPS by 5 (Non-fluid mode only) - 0 (Zero) Decrease FPS by 5 (Non-fluid mode only) - 1 Heal both players - 2 Slowmode (Fluid mode only) - 5 Navigate menu - Arrows Select menu - Enter Exit game/app - Escape About controllers The game works on keyboard for now, but it can somewhat work with controllers. However, the menu still needs a keyboard input. Player 1 gets the first branched controller, to have player 2 use a controller you must have a second controller branched even if player 1 doesn't use it. Yeah that's quite crude right now but I'm working on it ! Depending on the controller you may have different inputs for neutral/heavy/jump, I'm still figuring out how to make it work. Current status ☼ Hand2Hand still has a long road ahead. Everything before the 1.0 will be free. In other terms the last version before the 1.0 will be left for free but discontinued. ☼ You may see incomplete classes : they are kept for later. You may have fun with the 4 existing ones ! ☼ Some sounds are still 'borrowed' from other games, they are placeholders so don't ninja me with lawyers yet ; I will replace them soon enough and well before any penny comes to my pocket from Hand2Hand. Here bellow are the current milestones. Don't take them literally, as the development could change the order in practice.
