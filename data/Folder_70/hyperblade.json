    "About the game": "HYPERBLADE is a gameplay-driven action game where you can only move by dashing. Use your momentum to kick off walls and cut down your enemies. Abilities like time manipulation and bullet deflection allow for limitless improvisational play. Early Access HYPERBLADE has entered early access to get feedback and improve the game. The final version will expand on the story/lore, and have more levels and gameplay elements. Design Pillars Gameplay first - HYPERBLADE prioritizes gameplay over story. No long unskippable cutscenes to interrupt the flow of gameplay. Tough but fair - Players should feel challenged, but should never feel that they died unfairly. A sense of mastery - A player's skill should improve over time. The satisfaction of mastering a mechanic can be extremely satisfying.",
