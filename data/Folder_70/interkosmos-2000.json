Try Not to Die. 🌌 🚀 Key Features 🚀 🌌 You need to have a constant awareness of your surroundings, manage engine levels and maintain all systems necessary for survival. Solve any issues that may arise, you're in charge, and it is up to you to make decisions and prioritize maintenance work that will affect the capsule. Navigate through obstacles and asteroids, dock to space stations, glide over Earth and return safely once your mission is complete. Experience the desolation of the cosmos. Accompanied by extraordinary graphics and sound effects that will help you immerse in the story. Try out a fascinating story mode that takes you on a crazy space ride from launch to landing. Enjoy space in a free-float manner through the unrestrained Sandbox mode. 🌌 🚀 What is our game about? 🚀 🌌 Welcome (back) to the world of Interkosmos for an even wilder, weirder and more wondrous adventure. Experience the intense exhilaration of spaceflight. Explore the awe-inspiring interiors of a realistic space capsule. Master the crucial systems that keep you in orbit (and breathing).

Better load up the console and start spelling d-o-o-m… With more challenges, more stunning visuals and more mishaps than ever, the year 2000 has never looked so thrilling.",
