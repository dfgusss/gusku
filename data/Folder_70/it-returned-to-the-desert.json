    "About the game": "It Returned to the Desert is a unique mix of turn-based tactical combat and story-driven adventure game. Welcome to the lively desert town of Glint Rock! As Dr. Mill - Geologist - It's your job to find out what happened with the recent meteor crash and convince the towns folk of the imminent danger of mutated giant ants. Recruit a party to fight those six-legged freaks before they overrun town. Prepare for combat with a variety of arms and consumables. Use your time well and collect evidence to convince the local authorities. This is not a fight that you can win alone! Gather a party of supporters and take good care of them, as death is permanent and has far-reaching consequences. A large variety of characters and non-linear progression allow for great replayability. And a few mini-games and surprises mix up the experience every time. The game features a charming retro pixel art style and an atmospheric soundtrack, free saving and multiple difficulties. Even though the game looks like it's straight from the 90s, it boasts modern game design principles and no dead ends or overly high difficulty. / About Me It Returned to the Desert is developed solely by one Indie Developer... me... Tim Rachor. Though, I'm using some licensed third party assets. This will be my 9th game on Steam and the biggest yet, I'm very excited and hope you'll enjoy the result as much as I enjoyed the development!",
