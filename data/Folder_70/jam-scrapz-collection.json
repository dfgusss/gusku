    "About the game": "NOTE: Some of these games feature DXR (DirectX Raytracing). They will be marked with '{DXR}' next to their name. Be sure to acquire the latest video card that supports integrated raytracing to access it. A collection of old Game Jam projects revamped, remastered, and rebooted for commercial and more playable value! More than a handful of games to play! Abyss Rush How far can your rocket reach the center of the earth without crashing? Steel Rain {DXR} Survive as long as you can until you reach the surface! 99 Cracks {DXR} A treasure chest holding a relic called the Cerulean Shard. Located deep in a cave at the highest peak of an arduous mountain. Frozen ice patches, unstable bridges, hot geysers, shaky mountain tops. 4 hours of pure exploration and survival. No guides. You are on your own. Valentide! You are Cordante Saint Valentine; an intergalactic agent of the Corde, a race of xenophobic bounty hunters and assassins sent to collect skulls to use in their 'Great Journey' expedition. You have been sent from your home planet, Amourium, to planet Tera (aka Earth) - the only planet not yet registered in the Amourian index, yet the Great Prophecy demands skulls of 'homosapien origin' and the so-called 'humans' are the key. You have been deployed by the council to collect as many of these skulls as possible and bring them back to your home planet. Gene-Soldier {DXR} The Gene-Virus War has just begun and the Cyan Genes are losing, being cut-down by the Crimson Viruses to the brink of extinction. You may be the last of your kind; the Last Gene-Soldier. It is time to carry out your mission and vendetta: Fight your way through hordes of Viruses in search for survivors, and hunt down whoever is responsible for this horrific genocide.",
