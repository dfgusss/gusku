    "About the game": "Robots have stepped into the mysterious ancient ruins!　Can you find the priceless treasure in this labyrinth and reach the goal before anyone else? Rules Each player controls a robot to explore the mysterious ruins. The structure of the ruins changes with each play, as well as the location of items and treasures. From 2 to 10 players can play at the same time in one game. All robots start moving from the starting point, and nearby robots can voice chat with each other. The game is won by reaching the goal faster than the other players while collecting the treasures scattered inside the ruins. The number of players who can reach the goal depends on the number of players. For example, if you play with 2 players, only 1 player can reach the goal, but if you play with 10 players, up to 3 players can reach the goal. The game ends when the specified number of players have reached the goal, and the player who has reached the goal wins the game and the player who has not reached the goal loses the game. If your robot is destroyed by an attack from another robot or by a trap set in the ruins, you can challenge the labyrinth again from the starting point. Robots can form alliances with the consent of each other. Only one robot can be in an alliance at a time. Allied robots cannot attack each other, and the reward at the finish line will be divided between them. An alliance can be broken unilaterally, but the other party will not be notified of the breaking of the alliance and will remain in the same state as if it were still an alliance. For example, if A unilaterally breaks an alliance with B, A can form a new alliance with another robot, but B cannot attack A until he breaks the alliance himself, and the reward will be split between A and B when B reaches the goal. If both players in the alliance reach the goal, a bonus is added to the reward. Attention. This game is not a random match, but only password matching. We encourage you to invite your friends and go explore these unknown ruins!",
