    "About the game": "Chaotic local multiplayer Throw your friends in the lava and be the last survivor when the rescue finally comes. Fast and intuitive gameplay, up to 6 players on the same screen. Use different spells to be successful Choose and cast devastating spells. More than 10 different spells already available ! Super fast learning All you need is an analog stick and 4 buttons to turn your friends in smoking roasts. Limited Rescue is very intuitive but it takes practise to truly master the elements ! Free for all or in teams Limited Rescue already offers 3 different game modes so that you can bbq your friends alone or in teams. The game can be played with a keyboard but we highly recommend the use of gamepads (xbox, PS4, ...) to better enjoy the experience. Limited Rescue is 'Remote Play' compatible --&gt; Only one of you needs to buy the game and is then able to invite the whole squad to join through Steam, even remotely.",
