After the end of the day, each partner gives a quick assessment on how well the other partner achieved those goals. You both then review the results and end the day. Merit points are given to your partner based upon how well they achieved those goals. Merit Badges are also earned as you gain Merit Points. Results and progress are carried on to the next day and throughout the Session. Each Session, you are given 3 new goals to achieve daily for 4 Sessions in total. Each assessment and review only takes a few minutes each day and is very simple to complete but highly effective. All progress can be saved and Session Coaching can be accessed to provide further details about your Daily Challenges. 🏆 Session Assessment: At the end of 3 days of each daily challenge, you and your spouse will be given a Session Assessment. Each evaluation session is a few minutes. You and your partner each respond to a series of phrases through several response options. You then review each other’s responses and then conclude the session with discussions or silent reflection. Each private session can last 5-15 minutes. The complete couple's session can last from 30 minutes to an hour. Once the assessment is completed, a new Session is started with new Daily Challenges and goals. Affirmation, bonus rewards and commitment goals are added to encourage your progress. 🏆 Time Involved: Assessments are simple but can grant amazing insight for both partners to reflect upon. You both can discuss the results or can opt to not discuss the results after they have been reviewed. The option to go over areas of concern is also available. No 3rd party is ever needed and your progress is both engaging and rewarding. Although simple in nature, each Session can grant amazing results. Time efficient, user friendly and very easy to learn, Love Boot Camp can make a major impact on your relationship through the first evaluation. Commitment is key, but the rewards immense. Team work and dedication is the goal here. 🏆 Merits and Rewards: Merit Badges are earned through progress. Your partner’s assessment of your progress determines the points earned and the badges you receive. You also in turn determine your partner’s progress equally. Your perspective of your partner and your partner’s perspective of you is what matters most here, not the accuracy of the assessment. This is what is reflected over time and inspires motivation on both sides. Accountability is also automatic and helps to keep your progress honest and fair without any 3rd party intervention. Expectations: 🏆 Progress is entirely up to each couple. 🏆 Love Boot Camp is a 'self help' application, not a therapist. 🏆 You must stay committed and motivated to complete the process. 🏆 The both of you will encourage and mentor your own development. 🏆 Commitment is the process. Team work is the progress. 🏆 You both are the key to your success. *Love Boot Camp is not a therapist nor is it created by licensed therapists. Developed by a couple of over 20 years of marriage, Love Boot Camp is a 'self help' application designed to help guide couples into reflection, self development and cooperation. Progress and results are based upon each couple's willingness to work together. We make no claims or guarantees for any personal success or prevention of failure.
