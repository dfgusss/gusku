    "Release date": "Feb 17, 2023",
    "About the game": "Story Magic &amp; Legend are two kids who were playing in the park with their friends when suddenly... Aliens came down to earth, to take over the planet and drain its natural resources. To make it easier and avoid any technologies that humankind could use against them, they open a time portal and go into the past to take over the human race. Magic &amp; Legend will not stand for this! After telling their Mom, they follow the aliens from the time portal to rid the planet of the aliens and ultimately save the world! Features This platform action / adventure game harks back to the days of old, where the Gameboy ruled the world for handheld game play. The game features 5 large sprawling levels over the time periods: Level 1: The Journey Begins… (Present Day) Level 2: Medieval Times Level 3: Sengoku Period Level 4: Ancient Rome Level 5: The Crown Jewel Heist (60’s London) Players can switch between Magic or Legend at any point and use their different abilities to progress through the game: Magic loves getting up close and person, so uses melee weapons and can stomp on their heads (Super Mario style). He is the older brother. Legend prefers long distance attacks. He is younger and lighter than his brother, so can't stomp on alien noggins, but with his projectile weapon, he can take out the aliens from a far. In each level you must kill all the aliens before stepping into the time portal for the next time period. Magic and Legend have their own costumes and weapons and along the way, you will see other portals to mini bonus levels. These levels are just for fun, where you get to be a dragon, squid, a buster of ghosts and a mole man with a mallet! Lastly, to ensure the world is safe, the boys go up against a final boss who is hell bent on taking out Magic &amp; Legend. Will you take up the challenge and save the planet for all humankind?
