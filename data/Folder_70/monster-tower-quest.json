    "About the game": "You play as a hero on a quest to reach the top of a mysterious tower. The tower is filled powerful monsters that stand in your way. To defeat these monsters and progress through the tower, you will need to use your puzzle-solving skills to match 3 or more of the same colored gems together. As you make your way up the tower, you will encounter a variety of different monsters. By matching the correct gems and power ups together, you can unleash powerful attacks that will help you take down even the toughest foes. Each gem you match is kept, and can be used to create more monters. Collect monsters to build up a team of powerful allies to help you on your journey. This game combines the match 3 puzzle gameplay with the fun of collecting monsters!",
