    "About the game": "Background story There is a school in the town that has been deserted for a long time. It is said that a tragedy happened here many years ago. A lovely flower girl committed suicide in the school. When the news came out, many people felt very sad. Since then, some miraculous events have occurred in the school. It was found that every night at 12 o'clock, a girl dressed exactly like a girl who committed suicide would appear in the school canteen. Every night, she would sit in the canteen for an hour and then disappear. Moreover, every time she would leave a sentence: 'I want to go home.' What is more surprising is that sometimes someone will see her appear in a corner of the school and then disappear. Some students and teachers are so afraid of this phenomenon that they dare not go out at night. Some people think that this may be her soul looking for the way home. She may be seeking help, not threatening people. In any case, everyone in the school hopes that the poor girl's soul can find the way home and get a rest. Game playing method You need to work with your teammates to find and destroy the cult items that control the girl to save her soul. Of course, if you are brave, you can choose a person to go there. Ghosts don't follow people all the time. Her appearance has different rules. There are five different spells in the game, and they have different magic powers. As the game goes on, you need to observe the changes of the situation at any time. There are different rules at different stages. Once you break the rules, you will be in great trouble immediately. The game is not only about exorcism, you can also go to the campus to find some interesting things. For example, go to the basketball court to shoot a basket, or use the basketball to hit the chicken on the court, which scared the chicken brother to flee crazily. It seems that there are still some fireworks in the warehouse of the campus. Let's see if we can find it and spend a fireworks party with our friends on the campus. Game features Interesting ghost hiding methods When watching a zombie movie as a child, the protagonist in it needs to hold his breath to avoid the chase of the zombie when the zombie approaches. The method of hiding ghosts in the game is more interesting than this. You not only need to pay attention to the changes of rules at all times, but also need to be alert to the pitfalls from teammates. Random psychic events In addition to ghosts, some supernatural events will occur randomly in the game. When you are walking alone in the dark narrow corridor, you suddenly meet the funeral procession. You want to hide in the next classroom, but the door is locked. You can only knock on the door desperately There are many such supernatural events. Your teammate will disappear when walking. Don't be alarmed, just pray that he can escape. A huge map The game map contains all the facilities of a school, including different classrooms, laboratories, infirmaries, offices, canteens, dormitories, security rooms, basketball courts, etc. I promise to recall your memory.
