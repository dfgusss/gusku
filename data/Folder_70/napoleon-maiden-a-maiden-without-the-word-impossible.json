    "Name": "Napoleon Maiden ~A maiden without the word impossible~",
    "Release date": "Jan 27, 2023",
    "About the game": "Character sprites are made using the E-mote animation system. When they breathe, wink, or speak, it all looks very realistic. Moreover, 2 theme songs sung by Haruka Shimotsuki and Akira Ouse are included! Each character’s lines are fully dubbed in Japanese. *Works perfectly on Steam Deck. Change your destiny. Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools. Shoichi Sakikawa was a normal, second-year high school student. Or, he was, until he woke up from a car accident only to find himself trapped in mid-revolution 19th century France. What saved him from an onslaught of bullets was a girl armed with a sword. 'I am Napoleon Bonaparte. And one day I shall be ruler of all France.' Having been saved by this 'Napoleon' in the form of a girl, Shoichi ends up accompanying her on her quest. But in this world, not only is the past distorted, but the gods grant chosen girls the gift of greatness, who in turn fight one another using superhuman abilities known as 'Tenkei.' Will Shoichi be able to return to his own world? And what will become of his growing bond with Napoleon? Shoichi Sakikawa 'Just like that and I'm in another world? I don't know about this...' A normal, second-year high school student. He was in an accident and when he woke up, found himself in an alternate France. He now works together with Napoleon, who saved him. He's an earnest, caring young man. Napoleon Bonaparte 'What would you even do without me?' Her real name is Julia. She is one of the 'Ordained,' destined for greatness by the gods. She goes by the name of 'Napoleon.' Using her powerful ability known as 'Apocalypse,' she is able to call forth her forces, spawn cannons, and much more. She has a strong sense of honor and justice. She finds it difficult to open up to Shoichi. Christine 'I will never forgive you, swine.' A girl imprisoned for attempting to assassinate Napoleon. It is unclear whether she is an Ordained. Charles-Henri Sanson 'A painless death for these miserable sinners.' A girl who bears the name 'Sanson,' Executioner of Paris. Sanson came from a family of doctors and is known for inventing the guillotine. She presided over the execution of many famous people, including Marie Antoinette. Joachim Murat 'Oh no! You two, don't start arguing again!' Her name's Marie Antoinette. She's Napoleon's secretary, and a woman known as 'Murat.' She's helping Napoleon, who's really clumsy. Anna 'Are you... giving me something sweet?' A girl who, for some reason, is under the protection of Napoleon. Napoleon believes she is an Ordained, but whether this is true remains to be seen. She is absentminded and elusive. Occasionally, she says things that are cryptic. Horatio Nelson 'Hahaha, Long Live His Majesty the King! Trample on Paris, the capital!' Her name's Sarah. As Napoleon's longstanding enemy, she's a young girl who's known as 'Nelson,' after the British admiral Horatio Nelson. She’s naive and innocent, but her personality's extremely vicious, and she's repeatedly caused crises in France. Riku Kubota 'Did you prepare for today's quiz?' Shoichi Sakikawa's friend.
