The direction of the vertical movement is changed with each collision on a block or on the edge of the level. The goal is to remove all blocks of one color to get to the next level. The color of the ball is important because only blocks with the current ball color can be cleared. You have a limited number of lives, when all are lost you have the choice to start the game from scratch to improve your highscore or to continue playing. However, the points are set to zero again. Special blocks help to complete the level or make the game more difficult.",
