    "About the game": "We have it all (or some)! The sword master hero, the fireball totting maiden, a mechanically adept summoner, a great yellow canine who literally creates gold, a master of bacon... Well, each character is unique, to say the least! Finely crafted cardboard cutout characters give the game a unique and fun feel as you fight your way to godhood! Come and give the monsters a whack as you blow up the screen with fireballs and black holes, and then some! Master specific skills that create synergies with one another to cause mayhem and destruction. In Peachville, 1+1 is not 2, it is at least 4.5! What devastating synergies are there, you ask? You'll just have to figure that out for yourself! How many synergies can you find today? Rabbits, ducks...... strange and interesting poultry have a hundred skills with armed evolution and treatment suppression both. Each upgrade may be what takes you from wimp to hero! Spend gold to reroll your skill selections! Oh, and gain meta-progression in the shape of talent points to make your runs easier as you progress!",
