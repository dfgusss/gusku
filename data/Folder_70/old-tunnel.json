    "About the game": "The game takes place in one of the tunnels where there is a mythical spring that restores the youth of anyone who drinks or swims in its waters. A group of archaeologists, having found it, find themselves in a dangerous situation from which only a guard armed to the teeth can pull them out. Old Tunnel is a runner and platformer with a side view. Despite the fact that the character moves through the tunnels automatically, you still have something to worry about. Every second your hero has to make decisions: jump or roll under an obstacle? Or maybe to shield yourself from the threat? Solutions, solutions… There are plenty of traps and troubles in the dungeons that will finish your race ahead of time. Are you sure that you are ready for a new batch of tests? The main feature of Old Tunnel is stylish, pixel graphics, unusual gameplay, which together with music conveys the atmosphere of the mysterious and gloomy corridors of the old tunnel.",
