Secondly, the scrimmers (yes they are present, but they are not so much).. 'This is my first indie horror project, the script and concept of which has been reworked several times, inspired by many classic games, drawing ideas from them. I'm not good at animations, but if many people like this project, I'll release the next game with better quality with all the cut scenes and full voice acting, in many languages.' Spoiler - the game will be about summer camp. About Mechanics The game has classic mechanics such as - solving puzzles, searching for items, combining some items with others and also searching for passages and keys. The game also has stealth mechanics. About the Plot The plot unfolds inside a huge complex of the organization 'BLACKDOOR', which uses people for biotechnical purposes, which is why people began to disappear inside the organization, these disappearances are accompanied by paranormal events in which the main character will have to figure out what happened and how he got to this place.",
