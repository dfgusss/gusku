The next day when you tell your friend at school about the game, she comes up with a mischievous plan to turn you into a real life otome heroine and things go terribly wrong. Each route takes 1.5-2 hours to complete. There are 4 routes (plus a secret route) making it 5 routes in total. Description of gameplay: You don't have a choice.
