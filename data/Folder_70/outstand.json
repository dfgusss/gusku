    "About the game": "OUTSTAND is a game that reflects the real face of dark and intense fear to the person from a first-person camera angle. Your treasure-seeking friend is trapped! Can you save him? Solve puzzles, watch out for the items around you and most importantly survive! Each location's own theme, story, puzzles and characters play an important role in creating an interconnected world. Throughout the game, you will open new regions, find different skill sets, weapons, various items and try to perceive the places you encounter. Story Your childhood friend tells you he found a treasure map and will go and get it from there. He made this offer to you first! However, you did not take this matter very warmly. A message came from your friend one day and he is out of his mind, trapped! Break spells, solve puzzles and save him! Characters The disturbing life story of each character in OUTSTAND finds its place in the flow of the main story. Be mindful of every step you take so that you don't attract the attention of beings you don't want because you will never be alone. Environment The game starts in the jungle and teleports you to another universe through a secret passage through the jungle. It's a gloomy environment, you're alone in the woods, school and other areas, but the interesting thing is, where and why do these sounds that occur outside of you come from? Each zone is a maze-like structure filled with various rooms and paths to explore. The story of Outstand is told within the game. So there are no cutscenes to distract you from the terrifying reality of the living world you live in. Keep your eyes open though, the game will show you no mercy if you miss something important in your restless adventure. Everything has a reason and purpose, you just have to find out what it is. Supernatural Entities Can you deal with a demon tasked with guarding a treasure? Can you break the spell and get your friend out of this predicament? Inventory and Ammo Management You become more aware of your actions throughout the game as they are specific and limited. Think twice about when to fight, when to take cover, and how your actions will affect the world around you. You will need different playstyles to progress. Immerse yourself in this spooky world with high-quality images and 3D sounds.",
