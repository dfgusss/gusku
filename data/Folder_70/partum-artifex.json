    "About the game": "As the moonlight dances slowly across your room, your pseudo-sleep is disrupted by a metal squeak from your letter box down the hall. Someone just left a handwritten note, an invitation. 'Dear art aficionado. This is an invitation to one of the most exclusive and imaginative art displays. Not only is it an invitation but also an opportunity to show off your own credentials as an artist. Come join us and be part of the creation of something astonishing! Help us redefine and explore the concept of art. While this might understandably turn you a bit skeptical, just know that we’ve done a great amount of research and handpicked only a few individuals that fit our distinct criteria. You are one of those lucky few. Think about it for a moment; what do you actually have to lose? This is an opportunity for you to immortalize yourself among others in the world of art, the last chance to get out of your dreadful life and be part of something bigger.' The last sentence hits hard as you think about the recent events of your life. The invitation is oddly intriguing. Partum Artifex is mainly a puzzle game with an emphasis on story and atmosphere. Throughout the game, you'll be challenged with solving puzzles directly connected to the twisted works and mind of a serial killer. In order to progress you need to put yourself in the killer's shoes, and think like him in order to solve the puzzles. Willingly or not, he wants you to help him finish his magnum opus. By exploration, reading, taking notes, finding items and paying attention to the environment, you'll be able to piece together what happened in this eerie house and what the serial killer is trying to achieve with it. The more you dive into the mind of the killer, the more you'll discover things that are better off being hidden away. Sometimes the truth is better left shrouded in ignorance. Engaging Story: Partum Artifex offers an engaging story that delves into the mind of a serial killer whose main way of expressing himself is through art. Through the game, you'll learn not only why he's doing his deeds but also how it came to be. Immersive Environments: The game takes place on a property far from civilization, deep inside a murky forest. Every detail has been meticulously added to create a realistic environment in order for the players to immerse themselves and encourage exploration. Heavy Atmosphere: From eerie hallways to rooms filled with photos of the dead, Partum Artifex makes sure that you don't know what will happen next. Together with an incredible soundscape, it makes it easy to imagine the worst lurking in the shadows. Intriguing Puzzles: Each puzzle in the game tells its own story related to the serial killer. With the later use of various tools, the world truly reveals the mind behind the murders as his rambling writings become unredacted. Please, why don't you join me and be part of the creation?",
