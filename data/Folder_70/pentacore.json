    "About the game": "- Story - After extensive searching deep within the vast regions of uncharted space, the federation finally found what they were looking for. An unclaimed planet rich with natural resources. Not long after the discovery, scientist started to really take interest of the planets ecosystem. After a short time, the federation granted funding for a scientific research expedition. You have been assigned as security for the scientific team. You will be placed in a stasis pod until your set awakening time. After that, fulfill your duties as security. The Pentacore, an emergency escape ship, is located on the surface of the planet. As per security protocol, five key cards are required to start the ships engines. If anything goes wrong, find those keys. -Features Explore a large world filled with terrifying enemies! Find and collect many upgrades to expand your arsenal. In-Game timer for those who want to attempt a speedrun. Many ways to play through and explore the world. Unlockable secret ending! -Note to players Pentacore can be played with both a keyboard or a controller. For the best experience I recommend using a controller. Selecting the 'Help' option on the pause menu will show you what buttons do what. Using the 'Select' button will bring up a map. Rooms on the map will only be displayed as the player discovers them. Important rooms will have markers on the map but it will be up to the player to determine which markers mean what. Pentacore is a love letter to my childhood. A time period when games were in pixels and a true challenge. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to check out the game!",
