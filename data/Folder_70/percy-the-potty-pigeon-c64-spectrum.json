    "About the game": "Originally released in 1984, this side-scrolling egg-em-up from legendary British developers Gremlin Graphics saw players take on the role of Percy as he struggles to build a nest and feed his needy offspring. Now, relive those days in this remastered emulated version. Contains both the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum versions of the game. Gameplay In the Commodore 64 version, you must build a nest by swooping down into traffic and picking up twigs from the road, before returning to the nest, all while dodging an increasing number of enemies. In the ZX Spectrum version the nest is built, and instead you must collect worms to feed your hungry offspring. In both versions you can drop eggs to defeat enemies and cause havoc for passing traffic for bonus points. This enhanced version introduces a number of modern features to this retro classic, including: Saving/loading the game at any point Support for most modern game controllers Full control remapping Image scaling and smoothing options",
