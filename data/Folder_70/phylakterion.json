    "About the game": "Phylakterion is a co-op psychological horror game, playable for 1-4 people. You and your team enter haunted places to find a possessed item – make sure to stay alert, because the entity possessing it does not take your presence kindly and will try to stop you! Use different tools to locate the possessed item and find out what kind of entity is possessing it – Can you see the item’s reflection in a mirror? Does it scream when you drop it? Does the entity write with the blood of its victims? Then use the right rituals to destroy the vessel before the entity finds you! Can you retain your sanity and finish the task at hand? Early Access Features: 3-step exorcism : Search, identify, destroy! 5 different locations : Explore a city apartment, an abandoned mansion, a haunted hunting cabin and more! 7 different tools : You’ll need ghost hunting equipment, like Geiger-counters, cameras, or notebooks, to locate the vessel, identify the ghost possessing it, and destroy it! 1-4 players : play alone or with your friends. Unique entities : Stay alert and adjust your strategy to the situation, as every entity behaves differently. Afterlife : You might die if you’re not careful, but you can still be helpful to your team!",
