    "About the game": "Although it is a music game, it does not require complicated controls. Although memorizing the musical score can give you an advantage. Everything proceeds as you see it. When two or more circles overlap, the Pressing any key restores the life of the circle. Pressing a key when none of the circles overlap will decrease the life of the circle. The same thing happens over time. The game is over when the life of one of the circles is exhausted. Even if the sequence of stationary circles is simple, the speed of the passing circles differs. In addition, moving circles overlap each other, creating a complex polyrhythm. By the time you reach the final stage, an unprecedented experience awaits you. Recommended for those who are tired of music games that require only precise movements. Neither the difficulty nor the ease of existing music games exist here. It also has the ability to adjust sound delay and other functions. 6 stages 6 original songs You may feel that the number of stages is small. However, from around stage 2, it becomes difficult to clear a stage in one go. Also, all stages can be selected from the beginning.",
