    "About the game": "From the students of the Animation Workshop, Postmouse is a third-person single-player puzzle platforming game about a timid mouse who has to go on their first adventure to deliver mail. Having always dreamt of the world beyond their little post-office, Postmouse is emboldened to enter the great unknown. Meet charming animals, solve precarious puzzles and explore ruins of a time long past on your mission to deliver letters to those waiting to hear from their loved ones.  ____________________________________________________________________________  FEATURE LIST:  Run around and explore a vast, ruined landscape situated in the midst of a 19th century abandoned mansion - a lovingly handcrafted, overgrown teslapunk landscape.  Solve environmental puzzles, navigate treacherous climates, and most importantly - deliver the mail on time!  Meet and talk to the many diverse residents of the Yellow Woods on your journey - listen to their worries, and they may even help you on your way. Help Postmouse tackle new, exciting situations on a journey that explores the boundaries of their comfort zone.  Collect stamps for the local collector as you explore to receive beautiful concept art and background story.    ____________________________________________________________________________    STUDIO STORY - who are we?   In an isolated town, in the middle of Denmark, surrounded by fields. In a campus made from old military barracks. You find an education in Animation and Computer Graphics. There, in the dark, lit up only by blue light from computer screens, you will find a large group of students with a lot of creative energy. - Critters Collective! Formed, because we had no other choice. Please, do enjoy. It has been made with blood, sweat, tears and the occasional beer.",
