    "About the game": "Puzzle Bobble is a series of puzzle games in which the player fires bubbles from the bottom of the screen, and the bubbles pop when three or more of the same color stick together. The player clears each stage when they meet the conditions for that stage. Higher points are scored when many bubbles are dropped at once or when bubbles are popped by shooting bubbles and bouncing them off the walls. Have fun playing alone in puzzle mode, where you can take your time solving puzzles, or with a friend in versus mode, where you fire bubbles at each other. Enjoy ports of the arcade games Puzzle Bobble 2X and Puzzle Bobble 3, as well as four home console versions released in Japan and abroad, with added original modes. The games also have new features such as rewind, slow mode, and quick save, which are perfect for practice, strategizing, and stage creation. ◆Featured modes Arcade editions of Puzzle Bobble 2X / BUST-A-MOVE 2 Arcade Edition ...
