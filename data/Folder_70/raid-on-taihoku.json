Background Story Near the end of WWII, the USA Air Force chose to fight against Japan with island hopping, and the two countries thus had an air combat in the air of Taiwan Strait. On May, 31th, 1945, hundreds of American B-24 Liberators raided the capital of this island, Taipei. Many of the residents died in the raid, while more of them survived, facing the broken hometown.
