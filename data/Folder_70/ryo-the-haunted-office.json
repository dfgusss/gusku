    "About the game": "Ryo The Haunted Office is a 2D Top-Down Survival Horror game based on the story of a haunted office located in New Jersey. Ryo office was built in the 1970s where many employees used to work. Due to overwhelming demand of the company's services most of the employees worked for long hours, had heavy workload with frequent night shifts. Some of the employees just could not handle the pressure and left the company. During the early 2000s, one of the employees suddenly collapsed on his desk while working. In 2010, one of the employees who was going through acute depression, and huge financial crisis, committed suicide in one of the upper floors of the building. In 2012, another employee died in an elevator accident. It was said that the elevator fell from the ninth floor resulting in her death. The spirits of the deceased employees can be seen even today and some of the present employees refuse to go to certain floors of the building as they are terrified of the ghosts. An ex-employee called John, who is now a Paranormal enthusiast, decided to check it out in order to experience the paranormal activities by himself. You play as John and your mission is to investigate the entire office building for the paranormal evidence. Can you escape the haunted office alive? Key Features: Explore the entire office building!
