    "About the game": "A desolate and derelict station has been uncovered. You've been tasked with investigating, only to find the station's automated defenses are still active! Where did this place come from? How is it still... 'alive'... ? In this arcade space shooter, you pilot a ship equipped with bullet-buddies and take on an onslaught of attacks from alien-like automata (and organisms!?). Luckily, your ship is adaptable to some technology provided by the encounter, such as ship repair and weapon upgrades! Don't deploy too many bullet buddies, your ship's hull has only so much material it can use to fabricate mobile turrets! Use the ship's ultima-beam as a way of bull-dozing away much of what stands to hold you back! What lies beyond the veil of space and uncharted territory? Controls: Mouse - Moves the ship Left Click - Primary Fire Right Click - Ultima-beam 1-4 - Spawn Bullet Buddy Left Shift - Speed up Left Ctrl - Slow Down This also helps me get through school! Hope you enjoy!",
