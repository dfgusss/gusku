    "About the game": "Super Video Golf is a 90s styled turn-based golf game, with 4 player local and network support. Super Video Golf features a variety of full sized courses, pitch 'n' putt courses and mini golf. Game modes include classic scoring, skins or match play, with optional gimme radii of Under the Leather or Under the Putter. It also has a tutorial mode and a driving range for offline practice. Reaching specific milestones will unlock features such as the clubhouse where players can enjoy a variety of billiards games, or the course editor which allows arranging any of the available holes into a custom course. Super Video Golf can be played either as couch co-op with up to 4 players using 1-4 compatible controllers or the PC keyboard, or online with up to 4 computers connecting to a single game. Super Video Golf can also be played as a combination of both allowing up to 16 players in a single round! Players can customise their characters with a range of designs, hair styles and balls to choose from. Computer controlled players can be added to a game either to fill out a team roster, to practice against - or simply to pit against other CPU players while you watch and relax. CPU players feature adaptive skill, so as the player's level increases, so does the challenge! Unlocking the clubhouse allows the player to view trophies earned from unlocking achievements, as well as 8 ball and 9 ball pool, and snooker. Billiards games can be played locally or online and offer their own set of achievements to earn. Super Video Golf supports a wide array of resolutions, from as low as 640 x 480, all the way up to the latest UHD ultra wide displays. Full controller support means that big picture mode is fully supported, ideal for couch co-op play.",
