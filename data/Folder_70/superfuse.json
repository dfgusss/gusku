    "About the game": "Superfuse is a hack-and-slash, Action RPG that is a love letter to Diablo 2 with a twist: a unique Fuse System which allows you to hyper-tailor your hero’s skills based on your unique play style. Demolish hordes of grotesque abominations alone or with up to 3 friends as you uncover the secrets of the Corruption and the Gods. When humanity needs hope, be the hero! Choose between 3 character classes as you fuse multiple superpowers from the expansive skill tree system to create your unique Enforcer that is tailored to your playstyle. Smash a vast array of twisted monsters in classic ARPG combat. Scour a colorful sci-fi world for loot to make your hero even more powerful. Play solo offline or build a hero for online 4-player PvE drop-in/out co-op modes, mixing and matching your fused superpowers to create the perfect team. Travel across the stars as you grind your way through a stream of contracts with brilliant rewards and deadly challenges. Experience fast-paced, heart-pounding combat as you battle through hordes of fleshless beasts, slithering ooze creatures, and superpowered spandex-clad foes. Uncover a hidden conspiracy among the echelons of humanity and an alien menace on a dark comic book adventure packed with twists and turns. A Note on Early Access As with any Early Access game, this is a work in progress. We will be adding so much over the coming weeks and months to the game, including tweaking the balance and quality of life as well as multiple content updates (more news on the fun stuff that is coming at a later date!). We will also, and most importantly, be listening to your feedback and fixing bugs and making the game the best it can be, together with your continued support. Please keep an eye on the Community hub for news, updates and patch notes. We are committed to building a game that will live up to the legacy of this genre we love.",
