    "About the game": "If you were looking for a challenging yet balanced VR sword fighting game, look no further. Sword King takes full advantage of VR capabilities and advanced enemy AI to bring the best fast-paced dynamic and varied swordplay combat. The combat system Enemies are capable of a large number of attacks (20+ each) and are able to chain them in quick but fluid successions giving place to a very high number of possible combos. Enemies are capable of feinting as well as chaining feints with combos. Physical animations add another layer of realism to the game. Enemies move quickly and precisely, are aggressive and are aware of their distance from the player and launch attacks accordingly. Enemies will be less likely to block successfully if you perform different types of attacks and from different angles, and will be more likely to block them if you perform the same attack repeatedly (not yet implemented) Progressively harder waves Fight progressively harder stages carefully balanced to maintain the gameplay intact. Wide difficulty options Each wave has a difficulty rating, ranging from easy to very hard. An easy difficulty option is available for players looking for a casual experience.",
