    "About the game": "“The Abyss” is a concoction of the 3 genres known as Bullet Hell, Souls-Like, and RPG. There are over 20 levels with a plentiful amount of unique bosses and enemies scattered about the game. There are also quite a few puzzles and challenges sprinkled about. Put nightmares to rest to learn the Lunar Secrets of Mondriech by using the abilities and equip able runes that are collected throughout the game. In “The Abyss” there is a full movement and dodge system , as well as a projectile based combat system that deviates from the typical souls-like combat. In “The Abyss” you can only take one hit before you are sent back to your last checkpoint. “The Abyss” takes a deviation from the typical grindy RPG elements that you see everywhere. Instead of grinding enemies over and over to level up your stats there is only one stat, and that stat is your skill level. The bosses progressively get harder and require the player to have more of a grasp on the game mechanics to beat. “The Abyss” features custom controls for your keyboard inside of the settings as well as some accessibility settings like turning off the camera shake , and a performance mode . There are plentiful secrets just waiting to be discovered hidden throughout 'The Abyss.'",
