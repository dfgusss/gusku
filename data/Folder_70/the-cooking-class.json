    "About the game": "Come Cook With Us Welcome in the Dupont Family. A nice, quiet household in the Nova Scotia province of Atlantic Canada. Let's learn together how to cook delicious meals for you and your family. Because remember, can't live with an empty belly! Find the right VHS scattered around the house through a random system of placement in order to find the code to escape the house. Good Luck! The Cooking Class is an horror escape room, there are no hints, no clues, you are completely alone. Or, are you? The first of a scheduled trilogy of games involving the Dupont Family, The Cooking Class is an homage to VHS found footage horror, 80's and 90's slasher movies, and the story of a family and its legacy. A first person atmospheric game, where the player will have to find its way out.",
