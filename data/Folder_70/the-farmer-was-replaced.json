    "About the game": "Program a drone using a simple python-like language to fully automate various farming tasks that would otherwise be very grindy. Feel the satisfaction of simply pressing 'execute' and watching your drone do all the hard work. Farming earns you resources which can be spent to unlock new technology. Here's what the same program looks like after a few speed upgrades: Unlike most programming games the game isn't divided into distinct levels that you have to complete but features a continuous progression. Programming is done in a simple language similar to python. The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts that you need and is very beginner friendly by unlocking and explaining them one by one. If you already have programming experience you should be able to play through the early game very quickly and get to the more complex late game tasks that should still be a fun challenge even for experienced programmers.",
