    "About the game": "The King of Cats  is a short visual novel inspired by animal horror films and Michael Crichton's classic novel, Jurassic Park. Doctor Kemp is a millionaire wildlife biologist with a love for big cats. He just bought a litter of tigers for a unique business opportunity in Mexico. The only problem is the deal isn't exactly legal. He assembles a team to smuggle the tigers aboard a cargo ship and escort them across the ocean. But when a storm hits early in the voyage, the tigers break free and the hunt begins. Navigate the claustrophobic corridors of a vessel with man-eating tigers on the loose. Your choices will determine who lives and who dies. This is an approximately 9,000 word story with two major endings.",
