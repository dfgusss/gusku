    "About the game": "Many years ago In a far, far away land, a war began between two kingdoms, the white ones, and the black ones. No one remembers who started it or why. For years the war raged without either side gaining an advantage in battle over the other. But a few years ago, a move that changed the balance of the war caused the enemy kingdom to rush toward their victory. In the years that followed, battle after battle, the number of soldiers decreased, and the force of the kingdom faded. In a desperate move, the king gathered all the last of his soldiers into one last battle that would decide the fate of the kingdom, a battle that on only one soldier managed to survive. The last hope of the kingdom, the last pawn. In The Last Pawn, you will choose the kingdom you want to play as and cross the land in order to defeat the enemy and save the kingdom by yourself. Complete 21 different levels and face bosses in your journey to win the war. Features: A 2.5D shooter platformer experience Choose the kingdom you want to play as Use and upgrade different abilities Face multiple types of enemies and bosses Customize your character with optional customization coins hidden across the game Prepare yourself for the ultimate challenge after the main game is complete",
