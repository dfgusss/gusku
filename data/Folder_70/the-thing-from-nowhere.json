    "About the game": "The Thing from Nowhere is a Choose Your Own Adventure game inspired by monster movies from the 1950s and the Amiga classic It Came from the Desert . In the summer of 1952, something strange is happening in the small Alaskan village of Joy. A young girl believes she has seen a Qalupalik, an ancient Inuit monster known for kidnapping children. Most people disregard the report as the result of a child's overactive imagination. But not you! You're an intrepid cryptozoologist following in the footsteps of your parents, who were pioneers in the field. This could be the opportunity you've been longing for! Excited, you travel to the remote settlement, determined to unravel the mystery behind the sighting and find evidence of the creature's existence. As you ponder nature's wonders and doze off to sleep during your flight, the words of a biblical prophecy form in your mind like a warning: ' The meek shall inherit the Earth... '. Features Choose your own story. Your choices will determine what happens. Thanks to delayed branching, the game will adapt the story based on variables that register the choices you make. Choose your character's gender. Enjoy the lush and nostalgic ambiance created by richly detailed hand-painted scenes evoking 1950s technology, architecture, and fashion. Immerse yourself in a quaint and isolated town that is as cozy as it is eerie. Interact with an extensive cast of characters, including eccentric survivalists, conspiracy theorists, and creepy hotel managers.",
