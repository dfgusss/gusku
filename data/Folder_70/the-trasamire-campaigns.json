    "About the game": "King Unmorr is dead. His great Kingdom of Trasamire is in chaos. Across the realm, pirates, fanatics and usurpers claw for the throne. You are one of them. Key Features Addictive turn-based strategy. Fast-paced battles where your troops are your dice. Link captured regions to grow your army, while breaking enemy chains to deny them reinforcements. Tailor your battles with story choices and powerful ability cards. Perfect for any length session; spend minutes on a battle, or hours on the war. Five twisty tales shaped by interesting gameplay. Branching narratives, compelling choices that always matter, and many endings. A cast of colorful characters whose stories intertwine. Defeats don’t end the game, but introduce more story consequences. Chatty AI won't hide how they feel about you. Try it! “Ignore everything this game says about me. I’m the greatest hero in the Kingdom!” ⠀⠀⠀⠀-Sir Arthur Clawfyre, non-playable character.",
