    "About the game": "The '2D Coming' of the biblical epic puts YOU on the scene as history unfolds in real-time, challenging you to either repeat it or rewrite it! Follow in the footsteps of a prophet across a sprawling map as he seeks to enlighten the masses, and find your place among hundreds of other characters - each with their own values and allegiances. Be the devil that tempts him or the disciple that betrays him, as you walk the thin line between the dark and the light. Unlock the mysteries of creation and use up to 24 different powers for good or evil, in an action-packed world where the struggle to survive tests your faith. Upon playing through the game once, you can start again with a character of your own creation at any point in the story - and save your changes to all other characters to make the world your own! To challenge preconceptions, their appearance changes every time you play. The original 3D adventure has been reimagined as a stylized 2D side-scroller! Now with improved controller support for Steam Deck as well as classic keys &amp; mouse! Fully interactive narrative tells over 50 stories with scriptural references for further reading! Explore an authentic map of 30 historical locations! Find your place among hundreds of other characters with different values! Weapon-filled combat system recreates the violence of the era! Look after your health to survive each day in real-time! Economic system challenges you to pay taxes to Rome! Legal system risks real punishments for your crimes! Master 24 different supernatural powers for good or evil! Use the inbuilt character editor to make the world your own! * Neither pious nor blasphemous, 'The You Testament' draws on simulation theory to make ancient mysteries more relatable to a modern audience. Although every effort has been made to follow the spirit of the law, please understand that a game cannot follow the letter of the law. Any compromises have been deliberately made for your enjoyment.",
