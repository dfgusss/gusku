The game is cleared by upgrading the player by catching treasure chests and monsters that are continuously created, and by catching the final boss. Move freely and find treasure chests. Treasure chests are hidden all over the map. Along with simple quests, NPCs will tell you how to play and in which direction to play. Upgrade your players with coins obtained by finding treasure chests or defeating enemies. The player's attack is upgraded according to the attack power. Items you get can be converted into coins through NPCs. There are simple labyrinths and areas blocked by invisible walls on the map, which can be solved through interaction.",
