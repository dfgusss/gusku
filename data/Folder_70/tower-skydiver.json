    "About the game": "A mysterious tower has risen from the depths of the ocean all the way up into space, world governments have sent a special robot agent to get inside of it and investigate, your mission is to control and guide the robot all the way to the bottom of the tower in order to unravel the mystery. Will you succeed? Tower Skydiver is a 'skydiving' game in which you control a robot sent to investigate an alien tower, you are continuously falling and unfortunately you can't stop, you will have to dodge various objects in order to get to the end of the stage, there are different worlds, each with their own theme. You also will have to fight bosses which won't let you get through and also find your way out of some mazes. The deeper you go into the tower, the faster you fall, the game becomes harder and harder as you advance, hopefully you'll get good enough to get to the end. Good luck! Features: - An overworld map - Different worlds - 19 challenging levels with save-checkpoints - Best time records for each level - Power-ups - Much more Join our discord server!",
