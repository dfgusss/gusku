Explore the huge ancient tower. This is a pure offline singleplayer MMO Grind Simulator! THE DARK MYSTERIOUS TOWER Many years ago, a scribe working in the royal library found an old scroll hidden away inside the wall. It had the markings of an elder warlock from the council of the scepter order. The scroll pointed the way to the location of a huge abandoned ancient tower somewhere in the lands of the north. It was written that the tower itself is a living being, an evil place that has been alive for thousands of years built by the eternal master to keep watch over the lands. King Belmont, the ruler of these lands sent many expeditions to explore this legend, but none of them survived...
