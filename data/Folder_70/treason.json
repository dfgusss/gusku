    "About the game": "In Treason, a group of mobsters finds a dead body. The Don was murdered! The innocents must look for clues to identify the traitors and hold the murderer(s) accountable for their actions. When the game begins, a small group of players are chosen at random to be Traitors , and they have to murder every Innocent player. The bulk of the participants are innocent, but they are unaware of who is a traitor and who is not. The traitors can triumph by utilizing unique skills that they possess. The rules are simple: - The innocents win by finding out who the traitors are and take them out. - The traitors win by murdering all the innocents. There is 1 Detective in the group. He must investigate corpses found by players to nose out who the traitors are. - Clue Processing Unit system: Throughout the round, the body of the Don spawns. When a player finds this body, clues will be spawned over the map and players will have to collect them. If they bring enough clues to the C.P.U., one of the traitors will be revealed.
