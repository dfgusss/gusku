    "About the game": "Storyline: Tyrant Quest is an erotic, dark fantasy visual novel about a Dark Lord who seeks revenge after being sealed away for a hundred years. But an important artifact was stolen from him, and without it, he is too weak to defeat his enemies. And so he sets out with his last loyal subject, the succubus Lili, seeking a way to regain his power. Along the way, he will find new servants and meet new enemies. Among them, maybe he will encounter a mistress worthy of ruling by his side, and maybe he will build a harem fitting the Dark Lord. But whatever he does, he will have his revenge--or he will die trying! Content: Play an eroge with a long and intense storyline, with 15+ hours of gameplay featuring deeply developed characters. Several romances are available, each with several intimate scenes to get your heart racing. Every decision counts: would you be kind and good or harsh and cruel with your companions? A total of 7 different endings , including the possibility of establishing a harem. Over 58 erotic scenes in CG for your viewing pleasure. Sophisticated sound effects and original music to enhance the immersion. Main Characters: Lili is a succubus who was the familiar of the Dark Lord's previous lover. Determined to carry out her lady's last wishes, she found the Dark Lord's resting place and revived him. Now, she wants nothing more than to get plenty of her master's delicious semen, so she follows him faithfully on his quest. Yet her feelings might just be deeper than she lets on... Seren is the last surviving descendant of the Dark Lord's previous lover, and a witch who seeks revenge after her family was massacred by his enemies. She joins his cause because they have a shared purpose, but she is the spitting image of her ancestor, and she shares in her talent and her tastes, so she might simply be destined to fall for the Dark Lord. Elanor is the princess of the elf kingdom, and after getting captured by the Dark Lord and his forces, she finds herself at his mercy, along with her bodyguard, Rin. Although she has a kind heart, she is naive, and the more time she spends with the Dark Lord, the more she begins to sympathize with him. If she isn't careful, she may succumb to his wicked temptations... Rin is a proud swordsman from a land over the sea, and the sworn protector of Princess Elanor. She resolutely opposes the Dark Lord's wicked influence, but she has desires that she may not be able to resist, and if she is offered the one she secretly pines for, she might just betray her loyalty to satisfy her heart's yearning, and swear fealty to the Dark Lord. Ancalia is a powerful dragon who has been trapped in human form by Camellia, the high priestess whose predecessor sealed away the Dark Lord. Ancalia doesn't care about human wars, but she is bound by powerful magic to obey Camellia, and if she has to kill the Dark Lord, she will. But if he impresses her with his strength, he may gain an unlikely ally. Camellia is the successor of the woman who sealed the Dark Lord away one hundred years ago, and with Ancalia as her minion, she watches his progress closely. She has her own plans in store for the Dark Lord, and either he will bow to her willingly, or she will collar him and make him grovel. And unless the Dark Lord can defeat her, those will be his only options.",
