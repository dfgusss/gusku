    "About the game": "Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere is a tiny desert island where a multiverse spanning drama is unfolding. You play as Home, a cursed super intelligence bound to a soldier's corpse by an alien named Moon. Powers: Gain powerful abilities like super strength, lightning speed, and stealth as you help Moon care for the island's inhabitants. With these abilities, Home will be able to explore more of the island, defend themselves, solve puzzles, and get rich. Whispers: Those living on the island were mutated by the presence of Whispers, playful sprites that love disguises. Whispers will change their disguise as Home gains new abilities. The shops around the island have adopted them as currency, and Moon is able to harness them as an energy source. Blessings: 24 Killers features a unique file select that represents the in-game multiverse. Each 'file' or 'universe' has its own blessing. Blessings are optional modifications to the game rules that add extra challenge or help you complete future playthroughs faster. When you unlock a save file's blessing, it will be available to use in all future playthroughs.",
