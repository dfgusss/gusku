    "About the game": "Description You wake up in your squalid apartment. Your phone screen is horribly cracked, and the alarm won't shut off. You're so tired... you aren't even sure which job you're supposed to go to today. Everything is getting more expensive. Unaffordably expensive. Groceries. Bills. How much more can you take? How can this even be sustainable? Do you have what it takes to handle the struggle? Can you figure out a way to make it to a better life? To get out of this rut, and finally get your head above water? Enter the world of the protagonist, and find out if you can withstand the seemingly relentless hardship life is throwing at you. Or will you fall by the wayside - another chewed-up casualty of our unforgiving system? You can't control your luck, but your choices are all up to you... What Players Are Saying 'One mistake ended the game for me.' - First Steam Review (thumbs down) 'That seems so depressing.
