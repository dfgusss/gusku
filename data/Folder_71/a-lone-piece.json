Outsmart all the other pieces ♟️ Eat them to get power-ups ♟️ Defeat the evil king ♟️ Levels that get increasingly more difficult ♚ Opponents you know and love ♚ ♙ Pawn is a simple and predictable piece. But you better watch out if it gets to the other side ♖ Rook is a defending powerhouse. There's no way of escaping when it's securing the exit ♘ There is unpredictable and then there is Knight ♗ With Bishop in the board, you have to be careful right from the start. They like to attack ♚ For everyone ♚ ♕ Puzzles get increasingly harder based on your skills. Starts with 4x4 grid against one piece and gradually turns to full board and 16 pieces ♕ A good way to teach chess to children as well as mental workout for more adult taste ♕ Whether you're a seasoned chess player or a newcomer to the game, increasing difficulty makes sure you will have enough of a challenge ♕ Up your mental game?
