    "About the game": "You have fallen into a surreal and haunted underground neighborhood. Discover its origins and escape with your life - and sanity - intact. WANDER A VAST NETWORK OF MUNDANE HORRORS Anemoiapolis finds horror in the familiar -- places so ordinary that film and TV usually avoid them. Experience the comfort of existential dread. RUN, SWIM, JUMP, SLIDE, AND CLIMB TO FREEDOM With nobody around to let you out, you'll have to forge your own path to the exit. UTILIZE YOUR SURROUNDINGS Push obstacles and smash windows -- whatever it takes to get to the next room. SHORT CIRCUIT EVERYTHING Put your puzzle skills to the test. Break into electrical panels to access new areas. NAVIGATE DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS Don't count on that door being there the next time you swing around. Things aren't always as they appear. EXPLORE PROCEDURAL LABYRINTHS This game is designed from the ground-up to make you lost and confused. If you feel like you're going in circles, then you're on the right track. ABOUT Anemoiapolis is developed by Andrew Quist, a solo developer who takes heavy inspiration from his Michigan hometown. Encouraged by forum posts in late 2020 about 'liminal spaces' and 'the backrooms', Anemoiapolis is a personal retelling of those concepts. Soundtrack by JORDANN and 4REST",
