    "About the game": "Architect is a relaxing game where you build interesting scenes out of impossible geometry inspired by Monument Valley, M.C. Escher, and Oskar Reutersvard. Build mind-bending structures and populate them with interesting embellishments, one side at a time. You can aim for a high score by placing details next to those of a similar type or just sit back and make a masterwork of twisting perception. The sandbox of Architect is yours to explore and transform. In a way, you could think of it like a tool to make your own desktop backgrounds, miniature worlds, or even art prints! Architect is meant to be played as a slow paced, meditative, and artistic experience. Your only goal is to construct a space that defies the expectations of our reality.",
