    "About the game": "This is an adventure game, in addition to providing a scene of exploration, the game to do a lot of things rely on the roll of 20-sided dice, known as 'Play Chess' in the game. If the number of dice is greater than or equal to the number of dice on the other side, the game succeeds, otherwise the game fails. If you fail to roll a 20-sided die, don't worry. If you roll the dice again, 'Luck will favor the lucky one.' In the game, you can invite other characters to join the team. Of course, the 'invitation' still depends on the result of rolling a 20-sided die. In a game, the character who is first in line affects the outcome of the game. A game is more successful when a particular character is at the top of the line. However, we want to emphasize that everything is not absolute, there is always a certain possibility, but the success rate does vary. As the story progresses, we often find some unusual places, waiting to be discovered in the distance.",
