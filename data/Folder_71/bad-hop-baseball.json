    "About the game": "Power up and swing for the fences in this casual yet chaotic take on an American classic. Bad Hop Baseball is a game for one or two players Two Player Hot-Seat PvP or One Player Against a CPU Opponent Players take turns taking shots Players control the power and timing of their swing. After that, it's up to chance! Each shot generates a Baseball Outcome e.g. out / hit / double / triple / home run As in baseball, when one side has been put out 3 times, that side is retired for the inning When one player is retired, the other player will keep batting until they have been put out 3 times as well The game is 3 innings long Games cannot end in a tie! Extra innings will continue until a result is reached In-Game, In-Session, and All-Time stats are saved! Because if there's one thing we baseball fans love, it's STATS.",
