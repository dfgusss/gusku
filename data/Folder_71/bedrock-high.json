    "About the game": "Bedrock High is a Beat 'em Up Action-RPG set inside a modern American high-school. Learn the ropes, throw some hands, meet interesting characters and solve the mysteries of Bedrock High. Either play solo or bring a friend along as a helper. Jump or be jumped in both squad-based brawls and 1-on-1 scraps! Choose your skill upgrades to customize your combos! Collect money and power-ups to aid your adventure! Enjoy a variety of minigames when you're not busy busting faces! Talk to plenty of strange and unique characters! Unravel a story full of mystery and intrigue! Gain the respect of the many cliques that patrol the halls! Become the hero that brings peace to Bedrock High! Your name is Blake Griffin, and you've just been transferred to the worst school in the district. In this place, no one goes to class, no one cares about grades and, most of all, no one cares about anything except your ability to throw down. If you want to survive in this school, you need to know how to stay in your lane. But that wouldn't be very fun... would it? Take on the various cliques, bosses and challenges and solve the mysteries that lie beneath this lost school. Everything in this game was made by James C Gray. Special thanks to my friends Baldemar and SheWolfVal, as well as my son for playtesting!
