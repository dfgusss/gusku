    "About the game": "Visit an ancient Roman colony Find out how ancient Romans expanded their power, how they lived, and how the Empire fell into eventual downfall. You can enjoy a narrated journey or explore the colony by yourself in a small quest as a time traveler. Be a time traveler But what would it be like to see the colony in its heyday? Fortunately, you're not just an archaeologist, you're also a scientist who can travel through time. As such, you can move directly to 153 AD and explore the whole area, meet the locals and save the time continuum by completing several tasks in a quest. Or you can just float through the colony and enjoy a guided tour as a spectator. Welcome to Ancient Time Travel! Please support further development The Castrum Novum VR project is a purely private activity that was not funded by any institution. By purchasing the game, you are expressing not only your support, but you are also enabling us to finance the further development of our historically educational activities. At the same time, we will be able to improve the project and play with the details. So far, what you see we managed with a very limited budget.",
