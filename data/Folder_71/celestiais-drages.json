    "About the game": "Celestials &amp; Dragons is a phases game that combines the side scrolling gameplay common in the beat 'em up genre with medieval features similar to some Arcade games, namely a Hack and slash to bring back memories of the 'Golden Age' ( 20th century approximately between the 70s and 99s) of arcade games. Contents: This game is a player mode (single player), does not have a mode for two players or more (multiplayer), after all here you are the protagonist Klyght and you will need to live your story. The game has only the 'Story Mode' that does not alternate with player decisions, it follows the original story created by the author. Contains 17 combat stages and 21 scenes that tell the story. It is created to play until zero, it does not include saving progress, but if the player loses during one of the phases he will continue from there and can restart as many times as he wants until he can pass, not having to worry about 'Game Over'. The character's combat is simple, it has three different movements for attacks, two for using spells, one for defense, one for running, one for picking up items and has the directional keys. Here the enemies are diverse and will attack you whenever possible, some with simpler melee combat mechanics and others with their different skills. Music and sound effects in the scenarios, characters and enemies. Free movement through the scenarios with the screen unlocked, a mechanic that is a little different from the usual one that is the locked screen, but it brings greater freedom to run around the map and fight against enemies. 2D game, with Anime and Mangá appearance characters.
