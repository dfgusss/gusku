    "About the game": "Conur Life is a 2D open world video game, inspired by the first Grand Theft Auto (GTA), and located in a fictional city in the suburbs of Argentina, called San Hugo, based on the town of Florencio Varela. FEATURES: During your stay in San Hugo you will be able to enjoy a city with areas of both high society and the hood, buy clothes and accessories or get a haircut in the center or on the San Hugo pedestrian street. You can tune up your vehicles at the Mecánico Tejada in front of the plaza, buy weapons at the neighborhood tranza, you can wear the shirts of the popular Argentine teams. And if you prefer something quieter, tour the city in a 'borrowed' vehicle with Alexis, the main character of this unfinished story. Of course, be careful with the San Hugo police and with the gangs that lead the city, have fun and luck... you will need it. CHEATS &amp; CODES: By the way, the game comes with cheats...be careful with the zombies mode. NOTE: This game was developed by myself, I got no help at all other than creating sounds with my brother. So it is possible that the game has a few small bugs, however I managed to fix the vast majority to make it playable and enjoyable. At the time I had many ideas and there are several that due to budget and time reasons I could never finish. Thank you very much for understanding and I hope you enjoy this indie video game, created by me at the age of 19.",
