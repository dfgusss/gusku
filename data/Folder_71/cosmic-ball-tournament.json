    "About the game": "Congratulations Challenger, your audition to enter the Cosmic Ball Tournament is approved! A yearly tournament set inside a space dome where you will test your platforming abilities in front of the entire universe. Cosmic Ball Tournament is a first-person platforming arcade game where you will navigate through stages accumulating a high score. Completing stages requires fast platforming skills, quick thinking, and precise aiming. Plan your throws - Each stage has designated loops and walls to hit for bonus points - but beware, each is color-coded and only a matching colored ball will get you the points, whereas an incorrect one will make your score plummet. Activate your special ability, slow down time to line up perfect shots, and claim your title as Cosmic Ball Champion! The Cosmic Ball Tournament is the hottest tv game show in the universe with millions tuning in each week. Contestants are challenged with 6 stages a week, aiming to beat the combined course score and secure entry to the following week. Meet other contestants and learn what really goes on behind the scenes in a linear story that unfolds as you compete. Features 120 Stages spread over 20 courses to play and master! A linear single-player story mode taking you through as a contestant of the Cosmic Ball Tournament. Play your best to get through but the organizers might have different thoughts on who should win. Can you become the champion? Slow Motion! Getting high scores in a short time limit can be tricky, so you can slow down time to help with getting your scores! Replay and practice stages as much as you like once unlocked. Leaderboards for each stage to check where to stand against all other players! Unlockable outfits, because who wants to wear the same color all the time? Good luck and get ready to enter the Cosmic Ball Tournament!",
