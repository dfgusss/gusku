    "About the game": "COSMIC HOLES is a logic puzzle game based on the 5 elements of Chinese cosmology: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water. Here's a quick look at the relationships between these elements: Water, in blue, feeds Wood, in green. We can see that the Wood element turns fast in this case. Water extinguishes Fire. We see that the Fire element, in red, turns slowly in this case. Wood feeds Fire. But Water always extinguishes Fire. We see that the Fire element turns at a medium speed in this case. Characteristics A relaxed atmosphere in a space universe. Hundreds of logic puzzles of all levels of difficulty. Laws governing the 5 elements of traditional Chinese medicine. 4 logical rules to discover and respect to get out of each puzzle (see the Guide). A little story around the main character, the little green one. And for those who are too strong: An environment that will be able to defend itself. A challenge for the different areas of your brain that will have to cooperate a lot. A dedicated area to congratulate you on your prowess. COSMIC HOLES: strangely relaxing and explosive at the same time!",
