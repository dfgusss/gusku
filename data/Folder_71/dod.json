    "About the game": "Are you tired of disappointing games that are made by big company's that offers 1000 ways to play the game but none of them are interesting or fun to play? Well boy do I have the game for you, Meet DOD, a 2D arcade styled side scrolling platformer that does things a bit old school. No DLC, No Cut Scenes and No Realism . Back To Basics Back in the day there were no side quests just 1 goal. That Goal is to beat all the levels and beat them fast. Speed is key Each level has gives you certain amount of time points which you can increase by collecting time pickups. You must complete the level before you run out of time points. Bragging rights There are only 16 levels to complete and completing them all is an accomplishment by itself but what's better than that? Beating the level faster then your friends. Make your way to the top of the leaderboards.",
