    "About the game": "The floating continent-sized island known as Elfheim is home to all kinds of Elves, magical creatures, old mysteries and fantastical adventures! You will be stepping into the metaphorical shoes of Informis, a Slime king ripped out of his throne room and thrown right into this foreign world. With unrelenting resolve, Informis assumes the form of a creature he finds nearby, and in the process of foraging this new land meets a couple of playful Elves who are more than surprised with your unusual appearance. Not long after, your journey leads to an extraordinary sight, a giant tree unlike any other which hosts deep inside its trunk an immense library. There, you will meet it's guardian and go through her evaluation which will uncover some of the secrets that lie beyond your newly acquired human body. A 'Comic-like' Kinectic Visual Novel with more than 30k words. More than 160 hand drawn images. An original Soundtrack. Sweet Elvish love, lewdness and much, much more!",
