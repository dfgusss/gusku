Develop unique relationships with 200 other characters spread across 8 warring factions - each with their own beliefs about what the problem is and how to solve it. Explore over 50 different locations on your journey to reclaim every corner of the city, with hundreds of interactive objects to help you survive in real-time. Inheriting the combat system from the wrestling games, tearing enemies apart has never been so satisfying! For the 1st time ever, the original touch-screen concept has been adapted for a controller. Fully unlocked as standard, you can start with a character of your creation and save your changes to all others to make the world your own. You can even choose how many zombies you start with to either dive in at the deep end or ensure a slow build. If you prefer, a whole other 'Deathmatch' mode gives you all the fun of slaying zombies with none of the pressure! Survive among 200 other characters spread across 8 warring factions! Explore over 50 locations to reclaim every corner of a huge city! Immersive gameplay challenges you to survive each day in real-time! Dozens of interactive weapons &amp; objects that can be used for crafting! Wrestling-based combat system makes it satisfying to tear enemies apart! Atmospheric music reflects the danger of every moment! Stylized 2D visuals draw inspiration from pop culture! Edit every character to make the world your own! Act out your own scenarios in the 'Deathmatch' mode!",
