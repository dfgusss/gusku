    "About the game": "This game is a side-scrolling action game where you control Momotaro and fight against demons. You can select a stage from the path in the base. Try not to let your HP fall to zero while defeating enemies. There is a limit to the number of times you can use it, but you can recover it with millet dumplings. Momotaro will become more powerful when you open the treasure chest in the stage. When you reach the Jizo in the stage, you can recover and warp back and forth to the starting point. Defeating the boss will clear the stage, and you will be able to add new friends and learn new techniques. You can call your friends by consuming a gauge. You can check your moves and return to your base on the menu screen. You can use the keyboard or PS4 or XBOX360 controller to control the game. Saving is done automatically. Japanese and English languages are supported, and can be switched on the title screen. Press F1 to go full screen.",
