    "About the game": "Field of Arms: Tactics is a strategy game set in the 18th century Caribbean, recreating clashes between the empires of the time for control of trading routes, enterprises and territories.

This economic layer is built around the relation of resources and production. Players will have to battle against enemy empires competing for these resources and cities, they will also have to deal with both natives and maroon (escaped slaves) encampments, pirates who roam the map will routinely try to sack player-built structures and cities. CITY BUILDING (MANAGEMENT LAYER) In this mode, players will plan and build a new world city, deciding in which economic activities to focus and what types of workshops to construct, giving them access to different units, manufactured goods and bonuses. Taxes and upkeep play an important role in the game, so the player will have to decide how to best spend their available resources.
