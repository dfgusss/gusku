    "About the game": "You will play as a deliveryman and encounter various characters and events. You need to make your own judgments and choices. After that, your attributes will change according to the outcomes of your choices. When your attributes drop to zero or go too high, you will meet a bad ending or something special. The attributes will change slowly over time to prepare you for the incoming accidents. For example, you can give up the current event and let another personality take your place to handle all the problems for you. In this situation, the current event and changes to your attributes will be interrupted. Quitting an event comes with a price. Your attributes will decline after giving up events but your level will rise instead. Your level may play an essential role on certain occasions and determine the course of events. On Day 30, something will happen and you may reach the end or go back to the first day. Anyway, the fate of the characters depends on your choices.",
