    "About the game": "PLAY YOUR WAY Charge in sword in hand? Sneak past in a barrel? Dig a tunnel around the problem? Or maybe fire a magic beam and destroy everything in that approximate direction? If it works, it's not stupid! BRING FRIENDS Play online with up to 4 players! Build bridges and share healing potions... or grab your friends and toss them at your enemies as a distraction. I did not suggest that latter one, you came up with it yourself. GEAR UP Grab weapons off of your fallen enemies, or jump past traps guarding a treasure chest: There's plenty of weapons, spells, potions and crabs for you to find. Use any nice stuff you don't care for to add bonuses to the stuff you do care for through infusing! ...Or give them to your friends. They might develop opinions if you keep infusing all the good loot into your fancy bow. LEVEL UP Find and pull out those glowing Nails to level up and get some skillcards! Gain upgrades for the rest of the run, ranging from simple stat increases to good stuff like extra-potent explosives with Special Powder, excessive arcane power with Cosmic Will and the ability to dunk everyone you can get your hands on with Piledriver! DIE, PROBABLY Turns out saving all worlds is somewhat difficult. Don't worry! Thyme believes in you! And Architect is... I mean, more of a realist, but still vaguely optimistic! (George does not believe in you.)",
