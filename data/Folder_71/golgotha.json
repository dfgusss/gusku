    "About the game": "Golgotha is a short first person horror game that delves deep into creeping fear and severe paranoia as you traverse through the sinister grounds of Black Waters Station. Along the way you will discover the horrors that lie within and ultimately disturb those who are not at rest. The lantern and dim lights will guide your way through the station as you explore and find your way towards the exit. There are multiple cutscenes to encounter and items to discover. Golgotha features no combat. This game focuses primarily on atmosphere and dread. The game's main features are realistic immersion, fantastic sound design and disturbing imagery throughout. Black Waters Station is a large vicinity, and it will require some exploring and searching to progress through the game. (Security Cards, Keys Etc.) In 1942, Black Waters Station was overcome by a toxic and poisonous fog that killed thousands of people as they slept in the tunnels and platforms of the station to escape the war. After the horrific ordeal the authorities closed the doors to Black Waters and sealed it off to the public. In 2003 the station was officially reopened to the public. But after several freak accidents and unexplainable deaths, it was once again closed for good. It has been abandoned and undisturbed for over 20 years. Until now…",
