    "About the game": "GO ON AN ADVENTURE Grace Online is a 3D fantasy MMORPG (massively-multiplayer online role-playing game) featuring an immersive experience that allows the player to forge their path through exploration and discovery. We don't guide you through a world on rails, and as a result, there are many hidden secrets awaiting discovery. Grace Online also features an ambitious skill-based leveling system that bucks the current trend of pre-determined classes, allowing the player to combine skills to create a truly unique playing experience. Grace Online is a 3D fantasy MMORPG (massively-multiplayer online role-playing game) featuring an immersive experience that allows the player to explore an immersive fantasy world and experience discovering new secrets and unique creatures. Grace Online follows the traditional MMORPG method of only guiding you to the basics and no hand-holding as a result there are many hidden secrets awaiting discovery. AN IMMERSIVE WORLD When you play Grace Online, we want you to feel as if you’re immersed in a whole new virtual world. Rather than trying to manage this with just graphics and excessive backstory, we’ve designed the game with dozens of gameplay features that make you feel like you’re there interacting with the world, such as: Each non-player (NPC) you meet has its own goals and interest and rewards players that choose to be their friends. Shopkeepers keep inventory, so you can buy items that other players have sold to them. Want to help out new players? Sell your cast-off items to the shopkeeper in the new player zone and watch the new players go to town. Player to Player trading allows you to directly trade with another player Dynamic item placement in the world, This encourages world exploration at the same time may not be found in the same place again Crafting allows making unique and powerful items with the resources you gather from either exploring, hunting, questing, or getting it from other players. JOIN THE COMMUNITY The community is a critical aspect of Grace Online . We strive to maintain a strong, engaged community, supporting our players through: Live Events. Mechanisms for player-created quest content. Player-managed shops and vendor stalls. In-game communication tools like bulletin boards. Game and balance testing. HELP DEFINE THE GAME During our beta ('early access') period, your feedback helps improve the game, from small things like bug reports to large items like new skill suggestions, monster ideas, and more! We've already used hundreds of player-provided suggestions during our alpha period, and we'll use even more suggestions during beta as we get into the down-and-dirty details of combat, crafting, and exploration.",
