    "About the game": "Omni-directional scrolling twin-stick shooter. The purpose is to control the enemy base by operating a combat helicopter equipped with a Vulcan cannon and lock-on missiles. There is an arcade mode where you clear areas in order from area 1, and a free mode where you can play the cleared areas. There are 7 areas in total. It is recommended to use a controller for operation. Move with the left stick and rotate with the right stick. Vulcan cannons, lock-on missiles, and flares have ammo limits. Use flares to avoid enemy homing missiles. Boosters can be used at any time and will increase your movement speed at the cost of fuel consumption. If you get hit, you will take damage, and if the damage reaches 100% or more, you will crash. If it runs out of fuel, it will crash. There are no power-up items or repair items. It is recommended to use a controller for operation. Font by: / / Music by:",
