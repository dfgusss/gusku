After growing tired of everlasting life and having grown older than time itself, the gods built a gigantic monolithic machine. This titan of a device was to take on their endless burden of soul sorting and allow them to die. This 'Hellscreen' machine was soon constructed. But there was no rejoicing, only relief. In a flash, the old gods were gone, lost to time. After millennia of sorting countless souls, the machine begins to malfunction and displaces you. You are taken from the real world at the point of your death and deposited in the Hellscreen realm, instead of the peaceful afterlife you deserve. You are given an inhuman form and are called upon to destroy the machine and its infernal biome. It must be stopped from dismantling the fabric of all existence and destroying all reality and only you can stop it and reset order. Once this is done then perhaps you can return to your eternal resting spot. EARLY ACCESS INFORMATION Episode 1 - Releases Q1 2023 Episode 2 - Releases mid 2023 Episode 3 - Releases Late 2023",
