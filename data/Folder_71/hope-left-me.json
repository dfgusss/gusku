    "About the game": "It's so cold, and you're alone! In this short experience, unravel the mystery of your existence in this post-noir adventure in a cold forgotten reality, a concrete hellscape where the night never fades, the snow never melts, and nothing makes sense. This is a tie-in game to the album of the same name by Astrophysics. This game features: - 2 distinct ways of experiencing it through its soundtrack, the VN Cut (Visual Novel version of the tracks), and the LP Cut (The full, unchanged album versions of the songs). Choose what suits you best! - Around 15-20 minutes of stylized post-soviet despair. - VHS filter that can be adjusted to your likings.",
