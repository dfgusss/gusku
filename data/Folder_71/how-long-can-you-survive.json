    "About the game": "Game in development, many functions are not implemented. How long can you survive is a survival game in which the more time you spend in the same game, the more difficult it will be to kill the enemies. You control robots made by people who want to find a world to inhabit, since theirs was destroyed. In these worlds live monsters that have already fought against other robots and you will have the opportunity to get 'pieces' by destroying these enemies. The pieces will help you to improve your character and achieve a higher score. Try to reach the top of the leaderboards by achieving the fastest time possible in infinite mode. Gameplay select a character and choose the game mode, campaign mode or infinite mode. campaign: complete the list of missions and get the necessary coins to escape with the ship, if you die you will lose many pieces that will help you to improve your character. infinite: play as long as you want, the more time you spend, the more difficult it will be and the more loot you can get, when you see it too difficult, run away with the ship to avoid loot loss!",
