    "About the game": "Congratulations, Mr. President, you have just won the elections! No pressure. Take it slowly. It’s not like you can be impeached, die during the nuclear bombing or in assassination. Not like that at all. Check out free prologue! / So, as we have completed the formalities, let's talk about your new prerogatives: Experience the twisted and hilarious story of yet another President of the United States! Answer difficult questions and create the presidency which America – or you - need. Use social media and read the news – maybe this time they wrote something nice. Improve your country or simply watch it fall into chaos. Get into the character of Mister President and choose the answers that best suit the situation. Different options can help you make allies, but also enrage your previous supporters. Be careful with words and make sure that you don’t neglect any of the prominent groups or important people… or do and deal with the problems later. Touch people’s hearts with your writing abilities. Create the most compelling speeches and statements to achieve your goals. Want to calm the enraged strikers? Show the party that you’re the most efficient president? Raise everyone’s spirit at the state funeral? All of these can be done with a proper composition. Receive the title of the most charismatic leader ever!... ...or fail and make things even worse by being tactless. But hey, at least you had some fun writing about that salad you’d eaten in the Supreme Court! Use the most well-known social media platform - Screecher . Screech about your plans, attitude, call somebody names or maybe praise the voters. It is entirely up to you how you want to come across in the internet – as funny, empathetic, factual or maybe weird? But remember - there are always going to be responses from other users. Prepare for a public backlash! No teddy bears allowed. Everyone must stay at home from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. You cannot say a bad word about president. See? This is the real power. Throw your weight around when it comes to guaranteeing the rigid rules or put the freedom of the Americans first. Reject the acts that don’t appeal to you and check what will happen then. You are the Commander in Chief of the army and it is entirely up to you if you want to conquer the world , or abstain from violence. Remember – whether you send a group of soldiers on a secret mission or start a regular war – people will be watching your actions closely. Journalists, other politicians and leaders, justices, even common voters, they will all react to the situation. YOUR REGIME STARTS NOW You wish to start a war or maybe make peace? Take care of the poorest or support capitalists? Advocate for gun rights or stand against them? Support cats or maybe increase the dogs population? Everything is possible! Why, you may ask? Because you are President of the United States of America, that’s why.",
