    "About the game": "Story Your life and career as a top talent manager come crashing down as your top talent Summer Hsia betrays you to manage a massive entertainment conglomerate. She takes everything from you, leaving you with nothing. Determined to regain your dignity as a manager, you decide to start over and find some new talent to nurture. You have your eyes set on two diamonds in the rough and they couldn’t be more different. Evelyn Song’s stunningly dignified beauty and her exceptional creative talent make her a great candidate, but you can’t write off Rainie Lin’s bright attitude, trendy fashion sense, and incredibly sexy body. Unfortunately, you only have enough resources to manage one of them. The girl you don’t choose ends up in the hands of your worst enemy: Summer Hsia. Do your best to nurture your talent, and make her a star! Gameplay Manage your talent’s time and mood in this management + love simulator.
