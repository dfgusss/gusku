    "About the game": "Story Johnny is the ultimate fighter, destined for greatness--at least he thinks so. After getting rejected from the Gladiators' Guild tryouts once again, he sets off on an adventure to become the gladiator he knows he can be. Along the way he'll team up with a shotgun-toting schizoid mouse, a dancing kung-fu cat, and other colorful combatants. Features 12 total playable characters, from man-eating ghosts to killer robots to clerics No teammate left behind! The party levels up as one and shares the same equipment levels. Haven't used a character in a while? No problem! 'Friendly Mode', an alternate script that replaces all the spicy stuff for a friendlier experience. Modesty settings let you choose between nudity and skimpy outfits or more modest, junk-covering designs for enemies and outfits. Three difficulty settings that affect enemy resistances and the effects of their abilities. Bonus outfits and weapons for owners of Zeran's Folly and Leowald! Talk to Kista in Tenforks or Kirkeby and she'll deliver your gifts. 200+ abilities to master. Each character can have 8 abilities equipped at a time and many have 15+ to choose from 150+ runes (equipment modifiers). Each character can have up to 9 runes equipped at a time Save builds and share them with your friends In-game bestiary gives you the scoop on dozens of enemies and bosses",
