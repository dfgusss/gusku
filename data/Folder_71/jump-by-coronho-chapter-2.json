    "About the game": "What exactly is a Jump for? Coincidentally, several universes had earthquakes at the same time. Their reason is unknown. The only thing known is that, to their detriment, the ground in several locations has been torn apart and now it is necessary not only to jump but also to find other ways to move around and be smart enough not to die. What can all this be? What connects everyone? The saga continues. The Jump By Coronho universe is expanded with new characters, mechanics and stories in Jump: Chapter 2. Throughout the gameplay, the player picks up items that help him in the experience, such as a hook and construction capacity. SETTINGS!: The setting consists of 3 areas with different themes that are presented throughout the story, all handcrafted and with great care. INTERACTION!: Interact and chat with NPC's and try your luck with bossfights to progress in the story! DUBBING!: It is possible to interact with all characters regardless of their location, all characters have lines! SAVE!: The game now has an AUTOMATIC save system right after bossfights! I'm not a gamemaker professional but I hope you like it :) Controls: Right Arrow: Walk right Left Arrow: Walk left Jump: Space Interact: E Play hook: Left mouse Build: Right Mouse HAS EXTRA CONTENT. Hope you like it!",
