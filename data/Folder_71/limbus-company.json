    "About the game": "▶ A Combination of Turn-based RPG and Realtime Brawl Each turn results in a display of exhilarating action. In the combat phase, units on both sides will act simultaneously. During the scramble, characters targeting each other may Clash. The outcome of a Clash depends on the strength of their opposing skills and a sprinkle of luck; the winner can shut down the loser's skill. Ensure you use the right skills to win Clashes. ▶ Single-handed Skirmishing Connect skill icons across the grid, and your units will take action according to your commands. Chaining skills of the same color allows you to deal greater damage. Using simple and practical controls, watch as the Sinners dance to your tempo. ▶ Create Diverse Strategies with Identities and E.G.O Form teams of Identities and equip them with an arsenal of E.G.O that will create powerful synergies. Your foes come armed with a variety of Affinity-based attacks and tricky effects. In particular, Abnormalities are formidable foes that may prove to be considerable challenges. Learn their behavior and weaknesses, and compose the right team to eventually conquer them. ▶ Immerse Yourself in the World of Project Moon From the creators of 《Lobotomy Corporation》 and 《Library of Ruina》, another tale set in the same, unique world unfolds. In this massive dystopian metropolis, you will embark on a journey to find Golden Boughs with a cast of 12 Sinners. Enjoy a gripping story and the series of events that await. All dialogue in the main story comes fully voiced in Korean. Best of luck, Dear Manager.",
