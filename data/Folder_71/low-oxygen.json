    "About the game": "Low Oxygen is a small puzzle platformer about an astronaut that crash-landed on an alien planet, trying to find a way to reach his home, Earth, again. The Objective Explore a strange facility in order to find a way to blast off the surface of your new planet. You'll traverse 50 rooms filled with strange puzzles , and occasionally some fuel canisters, the ticket to your home. The Plants The main mechanic of the game is represented by the strange flora you'll find, plants that grow when they are ridden of their oxygen supply, and now its your time to get used to them, and use them to your advantage! The future My future plans are to expand this by adding a level edtior, steam workshop stuff probably , enabling player to make &amp; share their own hand-crafted experiences! Also controller support ! Closing Thoughts I hope you'll enjoy this small passion project of mine, don't forget to leave a review! I'll try to read through as many of them as possible!",
