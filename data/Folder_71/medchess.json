    "About the game": "Welcome to Medchess , a 2D isometric medieval strategy game where you build your own village using cards. Manage your gold, army, technology, and faith points to keep your village alive and thriving. Each year, you'll lose one point in each category, so make sure to plan wisely for the future. With cards such as the Farm to increase your food production, the Sawmill to improve your technology, the Temple to strengthen your faith, and the Barracks to form a more powerful army, you'll have everything you need to build the medieval city of your dreams. But beware, as bandits roam the area, threatening your village and decreasing your faith each year. Too much gold will also increase the chance of bandits appearing. Additionally, pollution can appear randomly, causing damage to your village. The higher your pollution chance, the more likely polluted areas will appear. With elements of strategy, management, and survival, Medchess is a challenging game that will test your skills. Can you build and manage a thriving medieval city despite the many challenges that stand before you? Try Medchess today and discover it for yourself!",
