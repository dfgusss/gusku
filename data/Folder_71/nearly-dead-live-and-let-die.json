    "About the game": "'When you're surrounded by zombies... For the best experience, online co-op play with friends is recommended. In Nearly Dead: Live and Let Die, survivors venture out to explore other regions and gather valuable items by day, and fend off hordes of enemies seeking to invade their hideout by night. This is a top-down hack-and-slash game in which players face off against the enemy hordes, combining a variety of active skills with dozens of traits and some 300 types of randomly acquired items. Protect yourselves against menacing enemies by exploring and growing with teammates, freely wielding never-before-seen weapons with a variety of patterns. If you've survived long enough and become strong enough, you can visit new regions to fight boss battles or put an end to these fights. Gameplay You’ll need to explore by day to procure items from regions overrun by zombies. Different options are available each day, and players can vote to decide which region to explore. At night, you’ll need to defend your hideout against rampaging enemy swarms. You can get resources directly from enemies, but you may also need to disassemble unneeded items. Craft new weapons using these resources, or supply consumed weapons. Main features: Co-op: Play offline or together with up to 4 players. Growth: You can strengthen your character by acquiring weapons, traits, and accessories and utilizing the synergy between them. Customization: Customize your character with hundreds of possible outfits. You can also change the color of clothing.'",
