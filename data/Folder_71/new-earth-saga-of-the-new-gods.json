    "About the game": "This is New Earth Saga of the New Gods. Our original intention had been to release this game as a series of Book's following the line of the source material, but after discussion, we decided to simply release it as, New Earth Saga of the New Gods, Act 1, and so forth. Each act will be released as a DLC to be combined with the existing game. Act 1 is intended as something of an introduction to the characters and universe of New Earth. Act 1 will be released in an early access format in a few months, followed by Act 2 in a few more months. The complete series is planned, at present, to be released within 2 years. ABOUT THIS GAME Story Blake 'The Hammer' Ingersol, is a college baseball prodigy, and avid gamer. He's dating Chelsea, a wild woman who always finds new ways to rock his world. One evening, as they and their friends are concluding a game, Michelle, gives a ring of wishes to the man she loves, who makes a wish... that will change everything, for everyone, and possibly... end the world. This game is a fairly faithful, though not entirely faithful, translation of the Book Series by Daniel Black, Saga of the New Gods, set in the universe of New Earth. This game was developed for you by a husband-and-wife team of game dev's, and we hope you enjoy it. Gameplay The game is built on choices that will have an impact on the narrative. Multiple love interests (once out of early access), monstrous, mythological, and human, are available to be pursued (in later books), each with their own backstory. The game contains explicit sexual content including (but not limited to) lesbian, corruption, voyeurism, masturbation, group sex (later in early access), BDSM, pregnancy(in later books), creampies, facials, bukkake, and more.",
