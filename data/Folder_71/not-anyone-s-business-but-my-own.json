    "About the game": "Navigate a local princess through the pages of a hand-crafted fairy tale and help her solve the mystery of a golden ring in this narrative-driven point-and-click adventure game with multiple endings. Yup, it’s a short game. It will only take you about 15 minutes to complete it. Well, maybe 30 minutes if you are a real achievement hunter. Every action (and inaction) has its consequences. Every decision can lead to catastrophic results. Like whether you decide to dig up a skeleton in a peaceful forest clearing or let it rest. Or cross a rickety bridge over a deep ravine. Or… well, you’ll discover the rest yourself. This game has five endings. Sad, epic, controversial… Some are happier than others. Will you dare to unlock all of them? Like any self-respecting fairy tale, this story has a charismatic narrator, an adventurous hero, and a couple of mysterious strangers. All of them have voices - literally and metaphorically. This game is crafted in full 2D. Like back in the day, when the grass was greener and the third dimension was a subject of legends and myths. Just come on in and play. There is no microtransactions, NFTs, paywalls, or other greedy creatures. Enjoy the journey!",
