    "About the game": "​Nuke Survivors is a simple-to-learn, but fairly deep, action / strategy game. It's Missile Command™ ​but with a serious twist: like ​ FTL ​and ​ Vampire Survivors ​, players get to make meaningful strategic decisions based on Roguelike mechanics as they play.​​ Each run is unique and random , but skill matters! The setting: World War 3 has started. The Enemy is attempting to destroy the player's cities at all costs. The player is in charge of Central Command, where they may launch Interceptor Missiles to destroy incoming nukes. Every 10 seconds, the player gets to choose a new buff, that makes them more powerful: they may build an army of tanks, make their Interceptors more potent, protect their cities with force fields, and more. Choosing the right buffs in the right order is essential to survival. As players play multiple rounds, they accumulate Buff Points, which may be used to purchase permanent upgrades for their base at the start of play, allowing them to advance further. Make no mistake: ​this game gets really hard .​ New enemy types and Bosses await players, and eventually... no one will survive!",
