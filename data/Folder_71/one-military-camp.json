    "About the game": "An evil maniac has conquered all territories in the region, except one. The world's last hope resides in an old military camp located in this peaceful land. Bring it back to its former glory, to recruit and train a brave group of fighters to push back the evil forces. Face the challenge of building a military camp, keeping an eye on the resources and logistics. Place the buildings efficiently, hire the staff that will keep everything running and set up the training courses. Build defenses, because the enemy will send spies and drones to try to sabotage your camp. Not only will you have to manage your recruits' training and your economy, but also their schedules, because this military camp doesn't rest! Take care of the maintenance of the buildings and the well-being of your rookies - don't let them get injured! Adapt to different biomes and research hundreds of technologies and upgrades for your camp. Recruit the best candidates to join your forces. Although they will start out as mere privates, assign them a specialty based on their skills and turn them into elite specialists in a variety of classes. Who knows? Maybe the best will be able to teach your future recruits… Put all those hours of hard training to work! Complete different missions to recover territory, gain resources and win the favor of the nearby populations. Balance your squad to be able to complete all the missions, as each one will require different specialties. Play a campaign full of absurd humor and references to war movies. During your progress, you will rescue heroes that will give you special boosts for your camp. In addition, you will also be able to play at your leisure in the Sandbox mode, customizing the game to your liking by choosing the biome, challenges and starting conditions. Your camp, your rules! Want to make your camp one of a kind? Choose your own anthem, customize the flags and signage and even record your own voice to cheer up your recruits through the PA system!",
