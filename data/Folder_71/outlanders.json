    "About the game": "Outlanders is a town-building strategy game, populated by hard-working, charming folk in search of a simpler life. Some just want to survive off the land, others want to create amazing things. It’s up to you to use the extensive catalog of tools and buildings at your disposal to guide them towards their goals. Outlanders are individuals. Simple folk with hopes, dreams, and desires.  You cannot control them directly. Instead, you place buildings, manage resources and declare the number of work spots in each building, then watch the Outlanders themselves decide who takes which job, which house they inhabit, and which building to build. You can nudge them in the right direction by prioritizing certain tasks, or by passing Decrees™, which bend the rules of the game to allow things like longer work hours and tighter resource consumption. But beware… these often come at the expense of your follower’s happiness, so use them wisely. Unlike other games of its style, Outlanders’ campaign offers a string of increasingly complex mission-based levels, each with its own specific goals and story, where new buildings and mechanics are unlocked organically throughout. You will follow the story of a cast of lovable, eccentric, and (mostly) well-intentioned town leaders, as they pursue their dreams and whims, while their paths slowly start to intertwine in surprising, often humorous, sometimes heart-warming ways. When challenges get too hard and the Outlanders start getting too picky, you can take a detour to the Sandbox mode, where creativity is the new leader in town. You can play with the full catalog of buildings and mechanics right off the bat and customize the maps and rules as you please. Create themed towns, make up your own goals, or challenge yourself. You can create the experience of your choice, the only limit here is your imagination. There are no wars in the Outlands. No raids, no combat, no armed conflict of any kind. All the Outlanders coexist in harmony. It’s the choices you make that will lead you to either victory or failure. The many biomes and landscapes of the Outlands are rendered in a crisp and vibrant graphical style, dense with atmosphere and details that linger with you long after you put the game down. It all comes to life through rich sound design, full of authentic soundscapes unique to each biome, and underscored by an uplifting music soundtrack that brings the magic out of everyday labor in the Outlands. People have been visiting the Outlands for a while now, and have come together on Discord to form a very friendly and helpful community. Join our server and find helpful guides and tips, share your theories on the world of Outlanders and its many mysteries, participate in community challenges, or share a nice chat with friendly people. The journey of Outlanders is only just beginning. As new leaders keep coming from far away to share their stories, and new ways of playing and sharing your experiences appear on the horizon, the ever-shifting landscape of possibilities gets more and more exciting. Everybody’s coming to the Outlands! Will you join them?",
