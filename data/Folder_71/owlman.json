    "About the game": "The following is a series of tapes recovered near the Overlook National Park where four people were recently reported missing- a family of three and one motorist. OWLMAN is a retro-stylized, first-person horror game played through the lens of a motorist documenting their favorite getaway. As they proceed back down the mountain and the sun starts to set, it becomes clear something is wrong. Explore an atmospheric open-world forest and evade the OWLMAN, among other threats. Features VHS , retro aesthetic. Linear story taking place across a series of tapes. Infinite Chase Mode : See how long you can evade the Owlman and explore the open world without the constraints of a narrative. OWLMAN is not a you-die-you-lose sort of game. It is sometimes necessary that the characters in the narrative meet their intended fates.",
