    "About the game": "This is a game that operates multiple fighter planes to fight with the enemy. The main operation of the player is to press the left mouse button wildly and enjoy the pleasure of countless bullets flying to the enemy. The hangar location is in the upper left corner. Players need to pick up different fighters for synthesis to obtain stronger fighters with their own special effects. Enemies are usually displayed in the upper right corner of the map. The game will be redrawn after the enemy is killed, but the intensity will be different and strengthened. Your stored buff is on the right. There are only four buff positions. If you pick a new buff without a position, it will be used directly, Dead enemies will drop fighter planes and buffs. Dead enemies are good enemies. After the enemy dies, some fighter planes and buffs will be brushed. Players can choose to save the same fighter planes to synthesize higher fighter planes, or save buffs until a certain number of them are used. The more buffs used at one time, the better the effect Go and lead your fighters to fight.",
