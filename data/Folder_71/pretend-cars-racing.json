    "About the game": "Pretend Cars Racing is an old school top-down racer, featuring split-screen multiplayer, 5 car classes and 25 tracks inspired from real venues. Its driving model has the right mix between arcade and simulation . You will be having fun in no time but with its high skill ceiling, you will spend hours chasing your best possible lap time. Race against three levels of AI difficulty, challenge friends via split-screen or remote play and chase the top spot in the leaderboards in hot-lap mode were you can race against your own ghost. Road cars, GTs, prototypes, open-wheelers and overpowered classics bring diversity and challenge to tackle more than 20 international tracks . It runs great in the Steam Deck !",
