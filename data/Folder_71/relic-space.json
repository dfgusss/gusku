    "About the game": "Relic Space is a turn-based, roguelike RPG with '4X' strategy elements in which you help rebuild civilisation following a galactic catastrophe. In the role of a legendary Omega pilot, you'll engage in deeply simulated, hex-based space combat as you explore and complete missions in over 40 distinct sectors , while acquiring new ships, and upgrading them with hundreds of equipment options . EARLY ACCESS VERSION With detailed combat mechanics, faction-based strategy elements, multiple game modes, and countless ship upgrades, the EA version already offers a complete 'roguelike' gameplay experience with tens of hours of gameplay. At the time of launching EA the available missions are mostly procedurally generated, and a lot more content – including the full handcrafted storyline, and new pilot skills, ships, and equipment – is planned, to create the truly epic experience we are aiming for. (So if your main interest is in the story, you may prefer to wait until full release before playing the game.) Tactical turn-based space combat Use your tactical skills on a hex grid with fast-paced ‘one-tile-per-turn’ mechanics inspired by traditional roguelikes, but with a fluid, modern feel. Deep Simulation Realistic combat mechanics simulate damage to individual ship components. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and acquire many more status effects. You will also need to manage heat, energy and fuel levels by making smart movement and equipment choices. Non-linear exploration Freely traverse a procedurally generated solar system with handcrafted elements. 4 main factions and 7 minor factions pursue research, trade, construction projects, and other goals irrespective of your actions – though your actions affect their success or failure! Flexible development Use your growing reputation and influence to acquire more powerful ships and equip them with countless weapon and utility combinations. Acquire new piloting abilities through a flexible skill tree, and research relics to unlock new powers and equipment. Immersive setting Uncover a rich, branching narrative threaded with endless procedurally generated stories in a detailed setting inspired by hard sci-fi. (NOTE: The main narrative will be added over the course of Early Access, and is not yet available. The Early Access version of Relic Space is built around procedurally generated missions.) Real Space Movement rules based on actual space physics: motion in a straight line is free, but turning, starting or stopping cost energy. It is the year 2612 and the galaxy lies in ruins. You are a member of Omega, the elite pilot wing of a community of survivors known as the Order. Originally an elite military organization set up to protect posthumanity from high-impact, low-probability threats, the Order is a community of genetically engineered supersoldiers with a fierce sense of tradition. After failing to prevent the devastation known as the Fall, their core aim is to recover lost knowledge and rebuild civilization. But recent events show an emergent new threat to their very existence...",
