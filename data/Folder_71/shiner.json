    "About the game": "Shiner is a turn-based strategy game where you learn all the attacks of the enemies you beat! Starting with only the knowledge of how to do a simple punch, can you snowball yourself into an avatar of (fuzzy) destruction? Make friends with a cast of cute and colorful characters! Every character in the game has a unique personality and a unique set of attacks for you to learn if you can beat them. “Why would I fight my friends,” you ask? Look, relationships are complicated. Buds can horse around is all I’m saying. Craft powerful builds! You’ll learn a ton of attacks, but you can only bring 4 of them into each fight. Can you find the right combination to beat an opponent who heals to full health every turn? What about someone who reflects all the damage you deal right back at you? Every battle is a puzzle and an opportunity for you to find a new way to break the game. 4 zones to battle your way through. A fully voice-acted cast of characters. 'One-Punch Mode' if the battles get too tough. A bite-sized experience! The game's only 1 or 2 hours long. Ranch dressing elemental. This game was developed as a student project at DigiPen Institute of Technology and was created for educational purposes only. Please check out our publisher page for more information.",
