    "About the game": "Help the villagers to build a village and rebuild the city. With each new level, your village will grow and develop. Breathe the old life into these lands! There are 3 islands available to you where you can get the necessary resources. Grow vegetables, get stones, or chop firewood. Each resource will be useful to you. With them, you can improve the building, complete a quest, or sell them on the market. It all depends on you. After you have sorted out all the important things in the village, you can go and try your hand at the dungeon. Fight monsters and get a valuable reward. But if you overestimate your strength, you will have to part with some part of your belongings. After you finish rebuilding your village, a whole city will open up to you! I think you know what to do with it. That's how you bring a small village into an entire island, and maybe not just an island. Anything can happen Bar and fishing Buy a fishing rod and go fishing in the local pond. The catch can also be sold and get a couple of gold coins. You can safely leave them to the local bartender. He was one of the first people in the village and had already built his own building. I don't know why he didn't help people, but it doesn't matter anymore. The main thing is that he can tell a couple of stories to pleasant music and a glass of something sweet.",
