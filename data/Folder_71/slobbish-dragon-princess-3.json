    "About the game": "It is recommended but not required to play through the previous Slobbish Dragon Princess games before being visited upon by the princess of the Nether. Rawr! Story A few weeks have passed since the tumult of Iris, the Rainbow Dragon, leading her Sea Dragons to Earth to take over the world's oceans. The dragons' attitudes have softened since then. They no longer threaten to annihilate anyone who gets too close to the sea, for one. Humanity and dragonkind are beginning to adjust to a new world of coexistence, although for now many questions remain. This, however, is a complex matter on a global scale. Our story revolves around an unemployed protagonist dwelling in a run-down dojo in Nowhere, Japan, living his best life alongside an ever-growing entourage of dragon royalty. A casual observer would no doubt assume they'd been living this way for a decade or more, given how close they all are. 'I hope these days can last forever.' Our protagonist thinks to himself, leaving his wish unspoken. As the end of August approaches, the town shopping district is beginning preparations for a festival to mark the end of summer. This will be the first summer festival ever experienced by dragonkind. Meanwhile, for humanity (and one unfortunate girl in particular) this summer festival presents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make special memories. Days filled with memories tick down one by one as the end of summer draws ever closer. Yet unbeknownst to our protagonist, a shadow is looming. 'I cannot allow the likes of that human to deceive my Haru-chan! She's the future of dragonkind!' With that cry appears the big, bad Nether Princess Mei (hereafter, simply Mei.) The world now faces yet another threat. But that's a story for later. Enjoying the festival comes first and foremost.
