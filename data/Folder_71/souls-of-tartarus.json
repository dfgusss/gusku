    "About the game": "Souls of Tartarus is a 'Rogue-lite', 'Souls-like' inspiered Top-Down Dungeon Crawler. A gamble with the ruler of the underworld 'Tartarus' gives you a last chance to be reborn. Can you defeat his Generals that became lazy and set in there ways? No Checkpoints. No Saves. One Run. One Chance. What is it about? The Barrier of a True Roguelike can sometimes be a bit high. So I tought about a way to combine Rogue-lites with Rogue-likes. You can die during your runs to earn resources but after every 3 runs you will have to face a Boss that needs to be defeated. You lose you start again. You Win you continue to climb up. Ohh and we also sprinkle in a bit of puzzle solving under pressure to keep your braincells fresh and on its toes. Set Losely in the World of Greek Mythology we also borrow from other cultures to create an interesting mix of culture within the Abyss of the Eternal God. Features: A Rogue-Like with the accessablity of a Rogue-Lite, replayability and the adrenaline pumping threat of permadeath. A fun main character that Swears alot. Be a shitty wizard, an awesome swordsman or a grifter in between... it is totally up to you! Top-Down Combat that isnt as fast as other Rogue-Likes, be more methodical, think ahead and strike when the time is right! Lots of spells and weapons, but be warned that you are an average joe.... so all you can do so can the enemy. Continued developement as in 'Early Access' so I will continue to finetune combat, levels, etc as well as add more stuff to round up the experiance acording to player feedback. Apart from randomly generated dungeons there will be new big and complex puzzle sovling dungeons in regular intervals. Plans for Release and After The main Realease will have 5 Randomly generated themes of dungeons that each offer specific dungeon types/Game modes, I call these 'Realms', and another 2 'Semi' randomly generated Dungeons that focus more on puzzle solving and a good old handcrafted touch of madness, I call these 'Dungeons'. After that I plan to regularely update new 'Realms' and especially 'Dungeons' to have a good pool of maps that randomly pop up in your runs. Soo...Will you rage quit sometimes? probably.....BUT.....you’ll git gud… Eventually. See Ya!!!",
