Our rules-enforced gameplay helps folks learn games, keeps track of scoring and gives you the feeling of sitting around a table with friends! Discover our growing catalog of competitive, coop and solo games. Focus on the fun and not spending all your time looking up rules. What's special about Sovranti? Full rules enforcement! No more guessing how to play the game or forgetting rules. Automated scoring for all games. Feels like sitting around the table with friends. If you can play the game on Sovranti you can play it around the table and vice versa. All of our game look and feel just like they would if you are sitting around a table in person. 3D environments. Want to play in a medieval castle or on the moon? Or maybe you would prefer to play in a garden? The choice is yours. Avatars! Part of replicating playing around a table is being able to feel like you are there. Our 3D avatars give you that sense of being there. We have lots more planned for avatars in the future! Voice and text chat built in. Solo play! If the game has solo play we add that as well so you can play even if your group isn't available.

All you need a phone, tablet or PC and an Internet connection and you can play with friends no matter where you are.

Our Platinum account unlocks all the games for you and everyone else at the table.
