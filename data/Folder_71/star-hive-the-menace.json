    "About the game": "Story: When humanity arrived on Mars, the first to step on Martian soil were surprised by the sighting of an alien reconnaissance ship. After a long analysis, scientific and military experts came to the conclusion that it was a preparation for a mass invasion of an advanced civilization and conqueror of solar systems. So a swift coalition of nations came together in an effort to build a space defense fleet, and a large freighter filled with missiles was built to represent human strength and hope for survival. Game features: The game has a story mode with 10 stages, each stage with 10 waves of attacks with regular combat ships and 5 bosses, one boss every two waves. The game also has an arcade mode with a table of the top 100 scores from Steam users. The player's objective is to control missiles to the targets, being able to activate the detonation mechanism at any moment after launching, but also being able to cause detonation with the impact with any object until the arrival in the enemy attack fleet. The steps in each attack consist of launching a missile from the launchpad, passing through the asteroid belt, accelerating the missile, and making contact with the enemy fleet. The missiles have a 'Stasys' system on the tip, which allows the capture of asteroids to be used as a protective shield against enemy projectiles and as an attack weapon, and can be released at any moment after capture, allowing the player to use simultaneous attack strategies.
