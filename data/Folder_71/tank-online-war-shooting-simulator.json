There are both offline and online options in the tank simulator game. Two game modes will meet you when you want to play an offline tank game. The first tank game mode is a team death match. In this mode, what you need to do is to destroy as many enemy tanks as possible. This will be challenging because there are four different online tank teams, including your team. You are expected to defeat three rival teams in the tank simulator game. To win the game in a team deathmatch, you need to destroy more tanks than the opposing teams. Once you achieve this, you will win the team death match. The other game mode is specially designed for those who like to play war games. The name of this mod captures the flag. In this mode, the number of teams is two in total. In this mode, it is possible to do tank battles with six players, including the opposing team. The mod's primary purpose is to bring the flag in the opponent's region to your region by carrying it with the tank. Each time you successfully get the flag to your area, you earn one point, and the person with the highest score at the end of the game is deemed the winner in the online tank game. Team skills are critical in an online tank game. Because if the whole team tries to capture the opposing team's flag simultaneously, your team's flag will be defenseless. That's why it's often necessary to leave behind someone who drives a good tank. This will be enough to prevent the enemy team from capturing your flag. Users who have played simulator games can have much fun in this tank game mode. The same modes also meet those who want to fight online in the tank war game. The only difference from the offline mode is that you have the chance to compete with other users around the world. You do not need to wait for any number of users to start the tank simulator game. To start the game, it is enough to choose a mode. If tank wars have started in online way, a direct connection to the existing room is established. If the rooms on the system are complete, a new room is automatically created and includes you. This process makes it possible to fight in the tank wars game without waiting. The tank simulation game has three tanks: Bronze, Silver, and Gold. These tanks can be used in every mode of the battlefield. Of course, it would be better to choose according to the mods. Because in some methods, speed is required, while in some modes, significant tank damage will lead you to victory. If you are confident in yourself, join the battles and be the winner of the game. Tank game is an online desert game. You have to defeat the rival enemies with tank war vehicles. When you start the game, four different objects appear in the environment. These are additional features you can get in the tank game. These features are; health, shield, bouncing bullet, and high-damage bullet. When you take life objects in the tank game, the life of your tank increases. Taking the shielding object reduces the damage even if the firepower opened by the opposing team players is high. The bouncing bullet has a blue color. With this bullet, you can damage the enemy tank by bouncing the shot from the surrounding objects. Most of the time, it is recommended to use this bullet in tight spaces. You should think carefully before using it because bullets reach opponent tanks in a shorter time in tight spaces. The shot with significant damage has a red color in the tank game. Users who play tank games have always wanted to increase the damage power of bullets. Therefore, this item cannot be acquired as a tank upgrade but only by collecting it from the environment. When you get this item, your damage will be significant. Objects appear again after a while. Therefore, it may be a good strategy to win the game to hide in the places where the objects come out.",
