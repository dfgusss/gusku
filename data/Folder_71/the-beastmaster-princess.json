    "About the game": "The Beastmaster Princess is a fantasy visual novel featuring a diverse cast, branching plot and several different endings (one for each love interest plus a harem ending). It takes place in the fantasy world of Aravorn, already seen in games like Loren The Amazon Princess and Cursed Lands. You can play as male or female protagonist and romance four very different characters, for a total of over 20 CGs! This is the story of Kunya, the child of Chief Goro, leader of the Desert Snakes tribe. Kunya is a formidable warrior and a future warchief. But even the most formidable need allies. Kunya can count on Luna's motherly cures. There isn't a single thing the shaman can't fix with her potions. On the battlefield, there's no better ally than Takara. Brave and hot-headed, she's always looking to gain more fame and recognition so that her name will be remembered by future generations. Though older than the others, Manila is no less dangerous in a fight. She may be a lone wolf, but she's always willing to share her wisdom and experience. With Lyara about to marry an elven prince, the tribe is in disorder. As a half-elf abandoned in the desert as a child, she has always struggled to fit in with the other nomads despite being adopted as Goro's daughter. Perhaps this marriage can return her to her elven roots. Unfortunately, events conspire against this union. As Prince Merril travels to meet Lyara, his caravan is assaulted by dark elves and he is nowhere to be found in the aftermath. Now it's up to Kunya and the others to track him down. They'll face numerous dangers, using force and cunning to overcome them. In doing so, perhaps Kunya will discover love along with the hidden power of Lyara, the beastmaster princess.",
