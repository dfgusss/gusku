    "About the game": "Gameplay The Crimping is a campy first-person horror adventure game featuring exploration, puzzle-solving, and interaction with an assortment of humorous and frightful characters. It is set in a large, continuous world above and below the streets of Portland, Oregon. Though a short game typically lasting 30 to 60 minutes, there are many achievements and easter eggs to find, including a fully-functioning 1980s computer with Rogue, several other games and apps, and dozens of supernatural files! The Story 'Hidden beneath Portland, Oregon's historical downtown buildings is a vast underground network of tunnels and cells that were used to capture and enslave tens of thousands of unsuspecting men and women. Many poor souls died in those so-called 'Shanghai Tunnels,' which are said to be one of the most haunted places in the world.' In The Crimping , you experience a real-life haunted hotel that was once used to 'crimp' or capture people. As you uncover the mysteries of the hotel's otherworldly inhabitants, you may find yourself drawn into the dangerous horrors of the Shanghai Tunnels. Only your wits and reflexes can save you from the horrors below. Will you survive The Crimping or will your fate be to join the thousands haunting Portland's darkest dungeons? Solve the mystery of Rose's restless soul in this light-hearted horror game based on real-life ghosts and haunted locations!",
