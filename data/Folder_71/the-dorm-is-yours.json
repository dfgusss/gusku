    "About the game": "It's sure is a nice place to live. A dorm that is. One might decide to spent their time mostly there on studying ancient texts. Another soul might not take any interest of that and would rather commit themselves to atheltic duties and no one can blame them for wanting to do that neither. It really is a beautiful place to move around and never miss the chance for a walk during sunrise. Another person might see no pleasure in any of doing that and would rather find themselves ways to be entertained all day inside their room with the help of modern technology and their endless potential to give you fun times. And if there really is not someone like that person there, then you might find a special mage that decide to settle their base of teachings right there at this dorm. Having lifes live on the adventures end of things, even if life-threatening, you might see that dorm as a great resting place. But that place wouldn't reach it's true greatness, if there wasn't somebody to maintain the property now, would it ? Manage your days and time during your employment, get to know the people in dorm.
