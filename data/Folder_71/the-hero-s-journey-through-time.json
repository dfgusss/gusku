    "About the game": "400 years ago, a bitter war between humans and magicians began, which is still going on today. As you flee your home to escape violence and death, you are suddenly homeless and alone. But instead of letting your desperation overwhelm you, you let your spirit of adventure guide you and embark on a journey to find out the real reason behind the war. On your journey you will meet a wide variety of heroes who are as different as fire and ice. You will meet brave warriors who risk their lives for their beliefs, but also benevolent magicians who use their powers for the good of others. You even travel through space and time to uncover the mysteries of the past and change the future. Although you have to face many challenges and dangers on your way, your courage and determination will not let you down. You will become a true hero who can end war and bring peace. Characters: Keji: This is you: A small villager from Waka Village. His home planet is Barun and he is a human. He is always very eager and spontaneous, but sometimes he thinks carefully about what he is doing. So far he hasn't seen much of the world, but one fateful day that changes. Helena: Helena is a magician from a village in the magician area. Their home planet is also Barun. She is still young and inexperienced and also on the trail of the mysteries of war. Due to her slight clumsiness, she also causes one or two laughs in the village. Christa: Christa is a thief from Waruun. Her home planet is Kemonomimi. She loves shopping and eating treats. She is, literally, a real sweet tooth, although she has a particular weakness for noodles. If someone steals her food, she quickly becomes angry and can hardly be tamed. In general, she is always optimistic, but sometimes she tries to show a slightly stricter side of herself. Among other things, Christa loves striking techniques. She also has a tendency to rely on her luck, which sometimes works more or less well. features: -Travel through different worlds -Day/night system -Quests between worlds - World jump possible at any time (if you have unlocked the corresponding world) -Own house with housing and furniture from different worlds -Casino with some mini games -Special daily changes",
