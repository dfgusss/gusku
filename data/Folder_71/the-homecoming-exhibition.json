    "About the game": "Welcome to The Homecoming Exhibition , a high-fidelity immersive gallery experience created in Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen . Immerse yourself in a fully interactive 3D world of modern art, sculptures, and culture as you explore the beautiful &amp; extraordinary minimalist environment inspired by Hiroshi Senju Museum . Experience the future of art with 'The Homecoming Exhibition' showcasing the groundbreaking work of Nako Baev . Minimal yet modern &amp; elegant I strived to create an open, luminous space where people would observe my works, relax and spend time in contemplation. I took on the creative challenge to design something where people could get inspired and driven towards their dreams and desires. My mandate was to explore how far I could push the quality of a real-time 3D museum for digital art. Listening to our lovely ambient soundtrack created by Evolsound which perfectly fits the gentle and calming sounds of nature around it. If you closely pay attention to the details you could find yourself an easter egg. Making it one unique experience you'll never forget. About the art &amp; the artist: Nako Baev is an award-winning 3D artist who has worked on various projects in the film and video game industry. His current exhibition focuses more on modern, minimal and restraint outlook giving the goal of this type of exhibition to showcase a number of pieces in a way that allows viewers to fully appreciate their beauty and simplicity. The pieces themselves are characterized by clean lines, a limited color palette, and a focus on form and texture they feature abstract or minimalist compositions. The sculptures are made of materials such as Calacatta marble, Ekeberg marble, or limestone. Each piece would have ample space around it to allow viewers to appreciate it fully and to avoid distractions.",
