In The Last Werewolf, you'll delve into a 2.5D world of mystery and intrigue, exploring three different towns and unravelling three captivating cases. Along the way, you'll meet new characters, discover hidden truths about your past, and come one step closer to finding where you truly belong. The story Lachie's world is turned upside down when she discovers she's a werewolf. Determined to find others like her, she sets out on a journey of discovery. To aid in her search, Lachie delves into the world of supernatural stories, and even creates a website, 'Lachie's Spooky Tales,' to gather information and fund her quest. However, her journey is not without challenges, as she must constantly monitor her actions and behaviours to prevent unwanted shifting into her wolf form. Each time she shifts, the trail becomes colder, and Lachie risks losing the chance to uncover the truth. Chapter One: Undead Rodents An anonymous source has informed Lachie that undead rats have been seen around the community park. With nothing but their word, Lachie checks it out while passing through the town. Chapter Two: Drunken Crimson Witness To be announced Chapter Three: A Regular Pic-a-nic Basket To be announced Current Features Game saving functionality to pick up where you left off with each update. (Currently only a single save game). Three distinct chapters featuring various cases to investigate and solve. Conversations with a diverse cast of characters, including witnesses and suspects. A 'Wolf Metre' mechanic that allows players to monitor their behaviour and actions to avoid involuntary shifting into their wolf form. An intuitive 'Wolf Sense' feature that provides helpful hints and clues throughout the game, while also being mindful of overuse, which may cause a shift. The ability to make progress even in the event of a failed case, allowing players to continue exploring the story and uncovering new information.
