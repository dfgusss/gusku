    "About the game": "Playing as a young witch, you will take the helm of your very own shop, supplying the local town with medicines and potions. The Witches’ Council have afforded you the opportunity to prove yourself, and offered you an evaluation period to determine whether your shop will become a permanent addition to the town. As the customers send you their orders, grow and collect the necessary resources so you can begin crafting items to fulfill their orders. Fulfilling orders will supply you with gold, the staple currency of the land, and as your gold reserves grow, much of your future success will depend on how you plan to spend it. Form pacts with familiars and utilize their unique skill sets to help you run a more efficient shop, allowing you to fill more order requests in a timely manner. As you continue to grow, you will be able to upgrade aspects of your shop, giving you more workspace, the means to have more familiars, and also begin learning new magic techniques, like forging runes. Upgrading your shop is integral to proving yourself amongst the Witches’ Council, and will put you in the best position to pass their evaluation. As days pass, continue growing your shop to the best of your ability, taking a humble start-up shop and turning it into a flourishing town favorite. Don't forget! The Witches' Council will have their eyes on you, and it's up to your success in the evaluation period whether or not your shop will stay around for the town.",
