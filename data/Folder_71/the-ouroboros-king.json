    "About the game": "The Ouroboros King combines the tactical depth of chess with the build variety and replayability of roguelikes. Build a formidable army, discover powerful relics, and buy surprising gadgets to defeat the Covenant. Core Gameplay Build the Ultimate Army: Combine classic and new chess pieces, relics that give them bonuses, and consumable items that grant you temporary advantages to create a formidable army. Perfect Your Strategy: You can only move one piece per turn, so you must choose carefully. Make your troops work together to obliterate the enemy army. Another Chance: If you're defeated you can go back to action on another timeline, where the path to victory will change: different map, different enemies, different rewards... Other Features Lots of end-game options to dial up the difficulty to insane levels. Chess-based tactics, easy to learn and hard to master. 15-45 minute runs, good for a short break and also longer sessions. No gatekeeping, all the content is unlocked from the start. Win or die based on your skills. No need to learn any chess openings or study anything. Illustrations by Isaac Murgadella",
