    "About the game": "Will your mind be broken? Given little information about where you are and how you will complete your mission a variety of strange creatures begin to arise giving you no time to question what to do. Sent on a mission to retrieve an 'asset' your only friend is your tenacity and firepower. With only a single weapon, embark on a frostbitten endeavor to make it to one of the 2 endings of this challenging game. Hard to nail platforming, swarming enemies, lack of direction, and traps will all force you to use your skills to reach the end. This is inspired by retro game mechanics so keep that in mind while playing. The Perdition Man: Interval is a single player campaign that is difficult intentionally, in order to enhance the experience. The shooting mechanics are a hybrid of survival horror and run and gun games, with platforming requiring precise timing. These challenges are made even more exhilarating by the daunting atmosphere that surrounds this psychologically trying storyline. Everything wants you dead, see for yourself.",
