    "About the game": "TRAUMA Broken Paradise is a Survival Horror Psychological Thriller - This game have Seven Endings and Eleven Outfits for you to Unlock by just finishing the game with specific actions. - This is NOT a Jumpscare Horror Game. TRAUMA Broken Paradise is a new experience at the same time, an old one. You're trapped inside an old mansion and need to solve riddles and puzzles in order to discover why you are there and why all this is happening? Also inspired by one of Stephen's King's greatest works: 'The Shining'. You can find secrets and everything happens in a unique way. - Fixed Camera Angles and Third Person - Easy combat but hard riddles and puzzles. - Endings based in different choices you make. - The game itself is a riddle. Very hard for some people and very easy for others. - MAP is available so you won't get lost and you can find some hints if you explore. - At least 6 hours of gameplay for new players and 12+ if you complete every achievement. - Inventory with 8 slots and an Universal Item Box so you can store your items when your inventory's full. - Some situations will require the player to take attention and observe the environment in order to proceed and they can be intentionally confusing sometimes. - Enemies are completely random which makes the replay factor more interesting. - Secrets are all over the place... you can find them while using the Camera, some of them are just... unexpected. To make unlocking multiple endings more dynamic, the gameplay is basically short once you learn where to go. This game was made with love! I'm a huge fan from the classics and true Survival Horror games. I did my best! *This game was created by only one developer.",
