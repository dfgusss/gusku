    "About the game": "ABOUT UC Love is a humorous, touching, and wholesome anime-style dating simulator with characters that have three-dimensional personalities. The characters are personifications of many of the University of California schools + a few surprises ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)! There are various locations to visit, minigames to play, and secrets to find! GAME FEATURES 5 Romanceable UC Girls (Left to Right: UCB, UCLA, UCI, UCR, and UCSB) Two Secret Romanceable Characters ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Cameos of the other UCs! Unique Storylines for Each Romanceable Character! 4 Mini-Games! Sprite Sets and Various Expressions! 9 Endings to explore! Chill original music! Wholesome vibes and funny jokes! TIPS Finish the game by successfully asking one of the characters to the dance! Each UC Lover has a set schedule that they follow each day. Explore the campus and pay attention to when you see your love interest in a particular place! Your UC Lover will only agree to go on a date with you if they are close to you, and will only agree to go to the dance with you if they are really close to you! Love interests will be more open and interested with you as they get closer with you! To build a relationship with someone, talk to them repeatedly and/or give them gifts! Each love interest has a loved gift, liked gifts, and disliked gifts, except for a certain Mr. Tree in the Mud, who hates all gifts. If you are at a dating stage, do well with the date minigame for some extra brownie points! After you are able to successfully ask them out on a date, you may be able to ask them out to the dance! :) EXTRA TIPS (SPOILERS) If you're looking to date Tommy, you can find him by taking a walk in the garden at night! :) If you're looking to date Stan Ford, you can find him in the field after you beat the gym minigame on hard! :) There are 5 cameo UCs hidden around the campus! Explore the campus to find: Mercedes (UCM), Diana (UCSD), Crystal (UCSC), Davina (UCD), Francesca (UCSF), Hailey (UC Hastings) GAME NOTES This was developed as a student project as part of ACM UCLA's 2022 Student Run Studios!",
