    "About the game": "Unification is a gravity-shifting VR parkour roguevania. Descend from the orbital factory into the layers of the black hole engine. Explore vibrant shifting architectures in a harmony of momentum and destruction... assuming you’re able to overcome the traps and inhabitants in your path. Features: - Fluid and powerful physics-based movement : Feel momentum and the wind rushing past while leaping into chasms, vaulting over ledges, weaving around traps, and shifting gravity at will. - Kinetic tools propelling you forward : Swing above traps with a grappling hook, or glide past with a parachute. Go in guns blazing with a shotgun, or slice with a katana. Forge a new path with a jackhammer, or warp through with a teleporter. - Procedural destructible biomes filled with traps and enemies : Navigate through voxel cave obstacle courses with branching paths that test your reactions, knowledge, and control. Feel free to explore the depths and get lost. The handheld mini-map and conveniently placed teleporters make it easy to quickly get back on track. - Dreamlike upgrades : Push the limits of physics and imagination during the journey to the core with fundamental changes to the game mechanics - Carefully crafted controls and haptics : Each action is positioned on the controllers to allow effortless simultaneous usage of all movement and tool capabilities, inducing a flow state of control. Player collisions, damage, climbing, tool usage, and more are fed into haptics for a complete loop of sensory I/O.",
