    "About the game": "And so, you find yourself here, at the apex of what we sought to achieve. vivid/stasis is a rhythm-mystery hybrid game that follows the fates of four girls as they get wrapped up in a mind-bending adventure involving organizations, mysterious disappearances, and the fourth dimension. The game ties together an ongoing interweaving storyline with varying levels of music-based gameplay. In the rhythm game section of vivid/stasis, you'll find yourself facing various levels of difficulty, with many options for customizability to play the game your way. Casual rhythm gamer just here to enjoy the story? Hardcore VSRG legend looking to find a new kind of challenge? There's a good chance you'll find it here! Between 'Opening', 'Middle', 'Finale', and the extra-spicy 'Encore' difficulty, players will be sure to find something fun for their skill level no matter their prior experience with rhythm games. Unlike other traditional vertical-scrolling rhythm games, vivid/stasis introduces the concept of 'Bumper Notes'; notes that take up two lanes. These notes can be hit with either of the keys assigned to the lanes it falls under, giving the game a unique playability with strictly four keys, despite the six types of possible notes. The song list of vivid/stasis features well-known and prominent artists in the music game scene (Tanchiky, Camellia, Silentroom), as well as a fair amount of lesser known producers. On July 21st, 2022, Tsuki Tasogare went missing after not coming home before her agreed time with her sister, Saturday. An investigation was picked up, but after less than a day of little to no progress, Saturday finds the lack of enthusiasm for finding her sister confusing, and gets impatient. And so, she decides to look into it herself. Alongside her friends, Allison and Kotomi, Saturday hopes to uncover the secret behind her sister's strange disappearance... and isn't quite ready for what she discovers. And while all of this is going on, rumors begin to spread about the mysterious organization known only as the Crosshatch, and their mysterious project, 'Operation Vividstasis'... Spread across multiple chapters, help guide Saturday to the almost-impossible truth that lies beneath the veil of reality. After all, you're the only one who can.",
