    "About the game": "The game is perfect for those who just want to press the 'Play' button and immediately get some fun and activity. Easy to play but hard to master. And you can play it while sitting or standing. In general, I don't like spending a lot of time on room calibration. Luckily, in VRNOID I just hold the Thumberstick for a few seconds to adjust the height and direction. Destroy all bricks to complete a level, and collect extra lives, power-ups. Collect all stars to reach the highest scores. Instead of using a paddle, swing the striker, just like in Air Hockey. Enjoy Retrowave music while beating tons of levels and boss fights. Features Classic stuff: tons of bricks, power-ups, levels, and bosses. Bullet dodging and reflection: enemies are trying to shoot your VR head, which takes the challenge to a new level. Dodge bullets or reflect them into the enemy. Smart boss fights: each boss requires a unique approach to defeat it. Most bosses have a second stage. In-game level editor: a fun tool to try out your ideas. Make challenges for your friends. Air Hockey: additional game mode with few setups. Local multiplayer: compete or team up with your friend. Player-2 will play on the monitor using a mouse or second controller. Flexible difficulty: 8 gameplay modifiers and 5 game difficulties are available. Play in your own style. Quick room setup: mega easy to calibrate room. Just hold one button to set direction and table height. Several seconds to do! LIV support and smooth camera for creating a great video content",
