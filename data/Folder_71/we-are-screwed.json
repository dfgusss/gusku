    "About the game": "ABOUT THIS GAME We Are Screwed! is a chaotic co-op space action game for 1-4 players. Working as a team, you and your fellow Space Cadets must save the Multiverse from collapsing. Slide into the pilot’s seat, operate turrets, become a mechanic or even a janitor on your quest to find the culprit who disturbed the balance of the Multiverse. THE MULTIVERSE IS IN DANGER The Multiverse is in danger! Some wacko stole multiple Great Plugs, which are items of great importance that bind the many universes together. Without the plugs, anyone can traverse the different galaxies via a series of pipes. However, if the pipes are left open, the plug-less galaxy will slowly die and disappear. S.H.E.L.D.O.N., your sassy on-board A.I. guides you on your quest to find the thief and bring back balance to the Multiverse! Along the way, you may meet a bunch of other intergalactic travellers in dire need of help. A mysterious drone, an odd hermit, a merchant space octopus... and cats?! Helping them is up to you; who knows, they might join your perilous adventure. LIFE ON BOARD Fresh out of the Space Academy, you or a team of up to 4 Space Cadets must pilot, shoot turrets, extinguish fires, clean up, repair, recycle and re-enforce your ship with upgrades while swarms of enemies bombard you with vicious attacks. With an inner and outer split-screen view of the ship, multitasking, and good teamwork are key to success and crucial in the hardest difficulties. EVERY RUN IS UNIQUE FOR INFINITE FUN The Multiverse in We Are Screwed! is procedurally generated, making every run unique! Regardless of whether or not you choose to try out a new spacecraft or module, it will always be a brand-new adventure. UNLOCK NEW VESSELS A variety of abandoned ships lie scattered around the Multiverse. Repair them to their former glory and get ready for a whole new ride as each offers distinctly different play styles for your crew! Some vessels are larger with more module slots and cargo space. Others are smaller, faster, and more agile, but offer fewer slots and cargo space. DISCOVER NEW MODULES Find and unlock new modules and discover crazy new weapons, defences, and other tools. Upgrade them from your hub and prepare your ship for epic boss battles! But most importantly, don’t forget to pet Scrappy! He is always hungry and will convert any item or junk you feed him into scraps that can be used to buy things while you are on a mission.
