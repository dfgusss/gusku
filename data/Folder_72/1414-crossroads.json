    "About the game": "If not you, who will save us? The year is 1414 and the cycle of good versus evil has renewed. A hero has been chosen by the gods, and the demons are assembling to challenge her. This challenge occurs every 101 years. The 1300s saw a great plague. The loss of human life was staggering. Regardless of their alignment with demons or gods, humans were overwhelmed by the ravages of the plague. This time, the demon forces were triumphant in capturing all the sacred scrolls. In the year 1414, your hero must retrieve the sacred scrolls of enlightenment, and begin to restore enlightenment throughout the world. The one chosen for this quest is Brendylynn, an enlightened soul on the path to becoming a rishi, an accomplished and enlightened person who, through intense meditation, has realized the supreme truth and eternal knowledge. She must navigate: An unfamiliar town, dungeons, monsters, friendship levels, buying and selling goods, and crafting food and drink. All this while meeting a host of interesting characters and visiting strange lands.",
