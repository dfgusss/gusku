    "About the game": "Alive Paint is a coloring book. Thanks to being digital, it doesn't require art supplies, it allows you to change your mind and recolor any picture as many times as you want, and its main coloring tool (the 'paint bucket') will help you fully colorize a page in a matter of just a few minutes! What's more, after you fill a drawing from it with color, it will spring into life and reward you with a little animation! Story and Gameplay You found a big set of paints and a dusty old book in your attic. Time has changed its shiny white pages into yellowish brown, but there's something about the ancient drawings in it that just doesn't let you put it down. You take out your brushes and start filling the outlines with color. After finishing one picture, you proudly look at it in all its vibrant colors and glory, and suddenly... Did it just blink? Am I too tired, or did it just move? You colored another page, and a balloon flew out of the book as if it had a life of its own. Then a spaceship engaged in a dynamic battle, an octopus started cooking breakfast and a magnet began pulling in all the metal screws lying around. Maybe that's all just a dream, or maybe it isn't. Only one thing is certain: if you got to feel like a magician instilling life into ink drawings, you wouldn't want to put the brushes down until you're out of paint. Technical Details The book consists of 45 pictures. If you like to make everything look as pretty as you can and will take your time filling every page with color, the game will take you around 2-3 hours to finish. Should you wish to just see the animations and splash one color over every image, this time can be reduced to ~30 minutes.",
