    "About the game": "Architecture Zeitgeist is a game created with great care by a student at the University of Brasília, with the aim of popularizing the teaching of architecture and making the experience of studying repertoire more immersive. The game has educational purposes and currently has two game modes: - Story mode: In this mode, the player will study the biography of a selected architect. He can walk through the projects and look for notes, which will tell the story of both the visited project and the architect responsible for the project. Once the player has collected all notes about the project, he will be able to move on to the architect's next project and deepen his studies. - Sandbox: In this mode, the player can walk freely through the project. Currently the game contains the following projects in each mode: - Story mode: Barcelona Pavilion (Ludwig mies van der Rohe) and Casa Azuma (Tadao Ando). - Sandbox: Barcelona Pavilion (Ludwig mies van der Rohe) and Casa Azuma (Tadao Ando).
