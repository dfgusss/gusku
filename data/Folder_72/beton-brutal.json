    "About the game": "Climb the tower BETON BRUTAL is a first person parkour game which tries to replicate and build upon the parkour mechanics seen in Minecraft. Your goal is to climb a massive overgrown concrete tower which offers multiple stages of increasing difficulty. Watch your step Beware, a single misstep might cost you a lot of progress as there are no checkpoints whatsoever. The course is however riddled with shortcuts which, when spotted, can save a lot of time and frustration. Vertigo If things get too stressful feel free to rest for a moment and take in your surroundings, just make sure to not peek over the edge too much.",
