As you climb out of the depths of this treacherous game, bones shall splinter, and the air will reverberate with the piercing screams of your enemies. Sacrifice your minions to keep ahead of the raging inferno that threatens to engulf you. Their blood shall become the fuel that powers your epic powers, allowing you to vanquish your foes with ease! You must prove your worth by enduring the ten initiation trials that await you. Only then may you enter the endless mode and challenge yourself to beat your own score. What sets BLOOD RITE apart from all other games is its unique 'human' resource management system. Your minions harvest precious gems to spawn new minions, and thus, keep the blood flowing. It is a delicate balance, but one that you must master if you hope to emerge victorious. Unique 'human' resource management Minions harvest gems to spawn new minions: When their numbers are up, sacrifice the surplus of minions to access the power of their BLOOD: Then use the blood for special powers: In this world, your fate lies in the balance between your minion count and the precious life force known as BLOOD. To become a true master, you must learn to delicately balance these two forces and emerge victorious in your trials. Epic fights - Monsters from all corners of hell have made it their mission to put you down. Show them who is boss by mounting towers, direct electrocution and firing minions with your crossbow. Only through cunning strategy and fearless bravery shall you be able to overcome the challenges that lie before you. So ready your weapons, summon your minions, and prepare to enter a world of bloodshed and glory. For only the strongest shall emerge victorious, and the weak shall be cast aside. Will you rise out of the depths and become a legend, or will you fall into the darkness and be forgotten? The choice is yours! Procedurally generated gameplay - Endless tunnels and monsters, all procedurally generated. No one tunnel will be the same.",
