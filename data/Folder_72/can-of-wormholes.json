Each puzzle is designed to teach a new idea or interaction that was hidden in plain sight all along. Gameplay features Over 100 hand crafted puzzle stages. No filler content! Every puzzle introduces a new idea or interaction. An interactive over world connects the puzzle stages together and holds puzzles of its own. Unlimited undos and restarts. A playable hint system. Every stage has an optional alternative mini-stage designed to tease out the key insight required to solve that puzzle. Accessibility notes Game is fully playable with keyboard or gamepad (Gamepad not supported on Mac at present). No mouse input is required. No time critical inputs are required. No simultaneous key presses are required. Hearing impaired friendly. Colorblind friendly.",
