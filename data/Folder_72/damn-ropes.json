    "About the game": "Damn Ropes is this one hard game nobody wants to play because it's too difficult a challenge but you play it anyway (just don't tell anyone you play on the 'Not So Hard' mode) . Join our Discord for updates, events and exclusive insights: CLICK HERE TO JOIN Enjoy this short but challenging game, made by one single person in his first semester (to be specific, most levels where built later but the core mechanics where made in the first semester. Why am I even telling you this? I don't know. Might be a nice fun fact) . Will there be a second game? Who knows? Maybe? There's no running and jumping in this platformer game. Use your rope to swing from platform to platform. Perform impressive maneuvers, beat diverse challenges and speedrun your way through each level. Oh, did I mention you can fall all the way down to the beginning of each level? So you're a fan of torturing yourself so you speedrun every single game you can find? Good thing we prepared the game for you! There's a timer for every level as well as a global timer to track your records. The obvious route to the goal is not always the fastest one (spoiler: It never is) . So the game isn't difficult enough for you? Then try activating a challenge. Or two. Or all of them. There are challenges like the 'The Floor Is Not Lava But Very Dangerous' challenge where you've to reach the goal without touching the ground. Or the 'Your Rope Isn't As Good As It Should Be' challenge where you can't expand or decrease it. If you can beat the whole game with every single challenge activated at once you gained my deepest respect. Wanna know how to activate them? Finish every level and I'll let you in on the secret. I wanted to create a challenging game, but I also want everyone to enjoy it. So I implemented the 'Not So Hard' mode. This mode helps a lot when you've trouble beating the game. It's easier to hit the environment with your rope and you can expand and decrease it further. As you might've suspected, there's a second Damn Ropes title in the works. This one won't be a solo project anymore. Instead it's being developed by FULL STEAM STUDIOS. And you guessed it, I'm a part of FSS. So look forward to upcoming announcements on our social media! (However this'll still take a while. Please be patient)",
