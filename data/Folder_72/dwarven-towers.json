    "About the game": "All was peaceful in the Dwarven Kingdom until the witches showed up. They wreaked havoc in the villages and enchanted everything and everyone with their dark magic. The dwarves are forced now to build towers and every time one of the witches casts a spell one of the dwarves is turned into a frog. Their only hope is to build as many towers as possible and score enough magical points so the witches will get bored and terrorize another region in the magical fantasy world they all live in. Key Features: - Build towers to fight the evil wickedness by arranging randomly generated and differently shaped bricks falling from the sky - Challenge yourself to maintain the integrity of the towers - Think fast, act even faster to cope with this frantic arcade puzzle action",
