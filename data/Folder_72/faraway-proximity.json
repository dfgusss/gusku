You are a famous book-seeker that has been contacted to recover another set of misplaced books. While traveling through different versions of a reality built by your gracious hosts, learn about the places you visit, the abstract beings you encounter and what the books really mean. Features Travel to the artificial realms where most of the books have been trapped. Solve various types of puzzles that will challenge your reasoning, memory and perception.

If you decide to read, perhaps you will learn something more about where you are...",
