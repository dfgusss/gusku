    "About the game": "Heartwood Heroes is a fast-paced board game RPG for up to 4 players featuring humorous quests, quick turn-based combat and multiple-choice events. Play locally or online with Steam Remote Play - only one copy of the game is required. Work both together and against your friends as you race to complete randomly branching scenarios! Explore - Travel the board to flip tiles, uncover locations and meet 'helpful' characters. Hero of the Week - Solve quests and battle monsters to earn experience points. When the final boss is defeated, whoever has the most experience wins! If you fall too far behind, a kindly snake will help you out. Light RPG elements - Customize your character's looks and equip yourself with weapons, armor, accessories and spells. Raise your stats and have followers tag along to probably help you win. Get a job - Choose from over 20 jobs such as Delinquent, Scam Artist, Diva and Super Hunk. Each one grants a set of skills to help you fight, earn money and equipment, and/or go really fast. Heroic battles - Take part in speedy turn-based battles against a throng of colorful foes. Join other players' fights to get a share of the experience! Even if you're knocked out, you'll be back on your feet in no time. Replayable scenarios - Between the random quests, events, shops, job market, and the board itself, no two matches are the same. Who knows what twists the story will take next? Quick play - One game can be completed in 1-2 hours. Customize - Fiddle with the game rules and board randomization, or make your own quests and characters via the Steam Workshop.",
