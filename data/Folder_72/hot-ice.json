    "About the game": "Well, you know what it is - to play hockey. A split of second to lift up your eyes and make a decision, splashes of ice into your face, feeling of flight and a great speed... Here it is - welcome! First person mode gives you a full sense of presense, realistic physical puck and only a short moment to escape the colision! You can invite friends, build a team and play online, or try your luck and play alone offline with an AI partner against exstra smart AI guys. Hot Ice was conceived and developed as an alternative to regular classic hockey simulators - presenting you a feeling and comfort of a spectator. You will find nothing of this kind in Hot Ice!) It's overhelmingly swift, tough and live. You control your player and drive the puck with a mouse - giving it the desired velociy and direction - lift it or let it go low, pass it to your partner or shoot. You can push, escape collisions by jumping or catch and tumble someone trying to push you. We hope you will enjoy our game and have a real fun and a nice time with friends.",
