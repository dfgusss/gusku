    "About the game": "You are Captain Johnny 'Jimbo Baby' McGibbits-The Infiltrator. Ace helicopter pilot, ballistics expert, neurosurgeon, rock star, motorcycle racer, and a devil-may-care all around good guy with a nifty haircut. Your mission is to fly into the country of the Mad Leader and carry out operations which will completely disable his plans for war. Ultimately, you are to eliminate the Mad Leader himself, as surely the world doesn't need yet another man who spits when he speaks and starts all of his sentences with the word 'basically'. This is a most dangerous and difficult assignment. You will be required to fly through hostile enemy airspace in what has been disguised to look like a neutral helicopter, reach several important target areas, and carry out specific missions to help destroy the Mad Leader's military force. There will be no time for acting or motorcycle racing this time. Or will there? Featuring: - The ultimate, realistic helicopter flight simulation - Exciting animated graphic adventures - The chance to win for yourself honor, fame, the respect of millions, and a lot of cash from your best friend who's betting you'll kick the bucket on this one Gameplay: - Interactive flight simulation: Fly through hostile skies as you attempt to distinguish friend from foe. Guess the correct password or get blown out of the sky. - Infiltrate the enemy base: Make your way through the enemy base. Keep your ID card ready and a can of sleep gas handy. - Discover Secret Files: Investigate the enemy hideout. Avoid guards, don disguises, and find the enemy secrets. - Get out before the enemy gets you.",
