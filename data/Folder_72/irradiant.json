    "About the game": "Irradiant is a minimal 2D, score-attack action game where you're faced with destroying mischievous spirits bewitching a shrine as fast as possible. You'll need to thread the needle on precision movement, button mashing and careful use of soul charges - your resource for unleashing devastation screen-wide slashes. Do you play safely at the cost of score? Or push your skills to the limit to shave off precious seconds? Your achievements can be viewed by all, with the online leaderboard. Replay your best run or watch others to see what techniques they use. Will you live long enough to face Kaizen and bring silence to the shrine? Highly responsive controls, it's up to you to master your abilities to obtain the best score you can. Time ticks away, hesitation will only hurt you. Light attacks are as quick as your fingers and give you air time. Heavy attacks have a cooldown but deal extra damage and fling you upwards. Collect soul charges to unleash a powerful slash attack, but beware: enemies you kill with it won't reward you with more soul charges. Use the environment to your advantage with wall jumps and dashes to speed towards enemies as they appear. Compete for the top of the leaderboard, where every second counts. Watch replays of leaderboard scores to discover new techniques. Custom engine with minimal hardware requirements. Playing with a controller is highly recommended. Music by Peritune. Voice effects by Voicevox.",
