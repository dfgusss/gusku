    "About the game": "Explore the continent of Cestina, fight against enemies in tactical battles, and become powerful enough to defeat a threat that keeps getting stronger with every day. Time will play an important role, being the prime factor for events, quests, monsters behavior, shops opening time, and much more. Eleven years ago, the Dark Beast appeared from the Sky Tower, spreading its curse through the continent of Cestina until it was sealed by the four heroes. Now that the beast has broken its seal, with the heroes nowhere to be found and a continent that hasn't yet recovered, it's up to Albus, adopted son of King Magnus, to defeat the Beast once and for all before it regains its full powers. Tactical battles with grid-based-movement. 100 abilities to learn, allowing flexible playstyles. Optional places and enemies, including super bosses. In-game clock - Time will advance by walking, or doing actions like sleeping or fishing. NPCs will act in response to time passage and your actions. Help them and you may change, or even save, their lives. Complete quests to get rare items and weapons.",
