    "About the game": "FREE BULLSEYE DEMO This free Manic Archers Demo will be released to complement the official release of Manic Archers on March, 20th 2023. It features a limited game mode selection, limited map selection, limited powerups and will automatically quit after a few minutes (can be restarted though). Other than that it behaves equivalent to the full version you can purchase on Steam as well: / ULTIMATE LOCAL MULTIPLAYER RETROGAMING ARCADE Manic Archers is a game that I personally would have liked to play back then, but it was not possible in the 16bit era because of technical limitations. A game that overflows with gems inspired by the arcade 2D high-times - 1000s of sprites and interlocking effects cumulating into a sensory overload of 16bit hype - while keeping that absolute, direct and perfectly controllable arcade grip. It took 2 years to perfect this game as a solo-developer. WHY YOU SHOULD GET THE FULL VERSION OF MANIC ARCHERS NOW Manic Archers is the first topdown Zelda-type versus game ever ! On-the-point gameplay and simple yet deep mechanics First rpg-style top-down versus fighting game with an arcade feel Lovely, hand-animated pixelart, inspired by the golden age of 2d arcade games Highly strategic matches vs. complete chaotic infernos Interactive levels Many common multiplayer modes AI support and coop-mode to practice without your friends Atmospheric music and hard hitting sound-effects Easy to play, hard to master Authentic classic RPG-scale sprites and environment expanded to HD resolution Official release planned for Switch, Playstation and Xbox separately till mid 2023. GAMEPLAY FIRST MANIC ARCHERS is an atmospheric and extremely addictive local and online multiplayer arcade game in pixelart-style. It features simplistic and on-the-point gameplay with amazing game mechanics and lovely pixelart-details. It is playable with up to 4 players simultaneously on one single screen in several well known multiplayer variants. THE MOST SIMPLE GAME OF ALL TIME One screen and 3 buttons is all you need to know - jump, shoot and dash/block . The depth of good gameplay is found in simplicity accompanied by great mechanics . THINK ZELDA AND DEATHMATCH With the intention to make a multiplayer match top-down game, MANIC ARCHERS owes to and actually should remind of the heritage of all top-down games like the Zelda and Final Fantasy series. Imagine the same love for details put into a competitive multiplayer arcade game for 4 players simultaneously. APPROVED MULTIPLAYER FUN In versus-mode players each control an archer, shooting the opposing archers until only one archer is left - besides Free-For-All versus, Manic Archers is featuring several other well known multiplayer modes . During the game a lot of combinable and game changing powerups and special arrows appear on the playing field, enabling players to turn the game around in an instant. AI TO KEEP YOU GAMING In case you need one more player to start a 2on2 teamplay match or if you are alone and want to train, Manic Archers got AI opponents to fill up the slots . RETRO CAUSE WE DO NOT NEED 3D FOR THAT The game takes place on a single screen with classic arcade wrap-around scrolling . The players make use of the top-down environment strategically such as water, higher grounds, obstacles and interactive map parts such as switches, explosives, burnable trees and more. Key Features Up to 4 players local and online Play arcade style locally AND online with up to 4 Players (via Remote Play Together). Versus Simple Free-For-All match, fast paced, deep gameplay mechanics (also available for Teamplay). King of the hill Keep control of the center of the map to gain points and secure the round (also available for Teamplay). Catch the fool with the chicken All players match against the one who got the chicken - the one who keeps the chicken longest wins the round. Conquer Dominate parts of the map to gain points, the one who dominated most flags the longest wins. Survival Coop How long can you and your friends survive against hordes of enemies? Manic Archers features a small coop-campaign that is also playable alone. Though DO NOT buy Manic Archers just for the coop-campaign - Manic Archers is primarily meant as a versus game. Deep gameplay mechanics The gameplay is set up for competitive and fun matches through deep but easy to learn game mechanics. AI Opponents Fill up the remaining slots with AI opponents with adjustable skill or create matches alone to train. Interactive and individual maps Interactive maps allow strategic advances which are easy to understand and use. The interactive elements available vary in each map SPECIAL MOVES Though you will probably find out these yourself, as they're pretty simple... SUPER DASH - Dash while on the way down of a jump, shortly before you hit the ground STOMP JUMP - Hit the JUMP button again while in mid air SHIELD - Hold down the dash button to shield yourself against attacks you are facing",
