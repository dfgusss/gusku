    "About the game": "Play as an unknown organism bent on devouring everything in its path. Your player starts as a small round pink blob, rolling around absorbing items roughly of similar size. As you grow, so to does your hunger, allowing you to eat larger objects in your path, eventually growing to the size of houses and eat sky scrapers. Use different abilities to navigate the map and reach different places across three urban areas. Speed - Increased speed to cover more distance Jump - Access areas in a 3D space Tank - Absorb objects bigger than you, but move slower Scattered across each map are local tasty treats that the organism has shown interest in. Use strategy to grow as big enough to devour entire urban centers .",
