    "About the game": "The award-winning darkly comedic game of televised chaos that critics have called a “ Bizarre masterpiece ” and “ Quite possibly the best FMV game ever ' is now available in VR! Not For Broadcast VR takes the gameplay, story, and gripping dark comedy of the original award-winning FMV adventure and brings you closer to the news than ever. Get a full view of the entire newsroom, interact with your equipment and punch, slap and grab anything that dares to get between you and the truth. We promise it’s so immersive you’ll feel like you’re really being electrocuted by your poorly maintained equipment! Egotistical celebrities, dishonest politicians, and strange sponsors clash on the airwaves. You’re in the chair to ensure that the show goes on uninterrupted. Or at least, that’s what you’re getting paid for. There’s now nothing stopping you from spending all day hitting yourself on the head with VHS tapes, we suppose. Hand-pick the headlines… with your ACTUAL hands! Experience the lost art of inserting a VHS tape into a deck through the magic of virtual reality. Carefully position your “air-conditioning” so the news doesn’t overheat and turn spin wildly around your desk during the adverts (watch the cables, though). Plus, shake your fist in rage at whatever political ideology you don’t agree with (Or at everyone, it’s OK, they can’t see you). Frame the picture; frame the debate Keep the general public entertained with your editing skills, and keep an eye on those ratings. Make politicians look greedy or brave, make resistance leaders look noble or violent, and make news anchors look charming or unhinged. Who and what you decide to show on screen might change the course of history. No pressure. Keep it PG If VR was invented for anything, it was the simulation of pushing important-looking red buttons. Smash it (or gently tap it; it’ll work fine either way) to keep rude words (and other sensitive information) off the air. Keep the news safe for children and oppressive political regimes alike. Tune out the chaos, load up the ads, crank up the volume and immerse yourself in the dreams, fears, hopes and neurosis of an entire nation, all while sitting on your floor.",
