    "About the game": "Novus aims to combine the Gorilla Tag type locomotion present in Gorilla Tag with the FPS genre of games mainly present on flat-screen games. There's an interactive type of movement in play which makes you have to use your hands to bounce of the ground to move where you want to, or you can use the dash. The goal is simply to shoot the other players and get as many kills as possible. There is also an in game proximity voice chat to help everyone communicate with each other and have fun! This way the game is more than 2x more immersing.",
