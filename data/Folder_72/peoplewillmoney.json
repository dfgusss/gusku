    "About the game": "This game is about earning money and increasing assets by building facilities and putting people to work. The player with the most assets at the end of the game wins. 〇Event An event always occurs at the beginning of a turn. They can be of various types, such as gaining money or people, or destroying a facility you have built. Some of them are useful for upgrading facilities and making higher incomes. 〇Facility 1 Facilities make incomes by putting people to work. Income margins vary from facility to facility. Some facilities are low-margins but have special effects. 〇Facility 2 Laboratories do not make a income, but they generate 'Finding' that is recorded as an asset at the end of the game. Only the number of 'Finding' possessed is not visible to other players. It is possible to make it appear to other players that you have few assets, when in fact you have.... 〇Policy You can directly interfere with other players. You can take people or money from other players or prevent other players from interfering. Others increase the effectiveness of events, increase the value of facilities, or generate research data. It is no exaggeration to say that good or bad policies can make or break a game. However, it takes a fair amount of money to purchase a policy.",
