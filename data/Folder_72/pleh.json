    "About the game": "THERE IS NO ESCAPE. Hey! There you are! This is my game, Pleh! I put a lot of work into it but... is it really that good? No matter how many things I add to it I always just end up... hating it... But you don't fully understand, do you? You don't know what it's like to be so small in a world that doesn't matter. Don't play this game. You don't want to know the truth. You don't want to know what it's like. There is no escape from it. This game isn't suitable for everyone This game has some mentioning of some heavy themes; Depression Suicide Social anxiety If you are triggered by any of these themes, and it hurts me as the developer to say this, you might want to avoid this game for now.

'Oooooh but I don't like walking simulators and have a short attention span and I want gameplay and shooters and gameplay!' Go play [INSERT OTHER STEAM GAME HERE THAT I CAN'T MENTION THE NAME OF FOR STEAM LEGAL REASONS BUT JUST IMAGINE A GENERIC POPULAR SHOOTER] instead, the game is free though, it's not like you'll complain and say it wasn't worth the money.",
