    "About the game": "Pyramis is a H.R Giger &amp; retro-scifi-inspired survival horror game, that will bring back the genre to its roots and modernize it in the process. The game is driven by its story, beautiful environments, exploration, and horrific themes. Pyramis contains non-linear exploration of most levels but mainly focuses on completing the central narrative. The game combines the combat of hardcore survival horror games with the stealth of non-combat horror, where your best choice is to hide, and allows the player to switch between play styles dynamically. This paired with 6 hours of gameplay, autonomous enemy AI and weapon customization will insure gameplay that is unique to every individual player. Pyramis also includes a replayable survival mode once the story mode is completed! Pyramis takes place in the year 2011, following the life of Paul Cook, an Airforce Lieutenant who goes AWOL in Antarctica looking for his older brother Walter. An SOS signal his helicopter radio receives leads him to uncover a hidden world that lies beneath the earth's crust and the true reason why his superiors restricted him from contact with his long-lost brother Walter. You will embark, on a simple mission to find Walter but soon find yourself fighting to save your own life in the archaic dimension, and make it back to the surface alive. Along the way, different characters will guide you through the alien world with the same goal of getting to the surface.",
