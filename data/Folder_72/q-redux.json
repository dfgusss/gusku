Cook up remedies for those afflicted by sickness, disease or curse. Build wealth, gain renown. About the Story ============ This project is an episodic Action-RPG where you play the adopted grandson of a healer woman. She succumbs to a mysterious illness, leaving it up to the player to find a way to help her. During that journey, he must learn to run her apothecary (healing business) and unravel the source of her malady. On this journey you'll befriend alternative-gendered spirits and learn powerful sorceries by calling upon them. About the Developer &amp; Mission ============ As an indie game developer, who has spent roughly 4 years (and well over 4,000 hours) actively developing this gaming project, I believe it should go without saying: this game is a labor of love &amp; passion. The goal is to craft quality, digital experiences (i.e., games) that help inspire people to broaden their perspectives on common, taken-for-granted societal constructs in an intuitive manner. Team iNtuition values the notion of educating people on complex topics in intuitive ways through technology. (Also, I enjoy magic but feel most games do it a disservice by treating it like another type of gun, at best). As part of Team iNtution, I am lead developer, tech artist &amp; founder. I do tasks ranging from 3D Modeling, rigging, animating, texture editing, design, story and narrative. I do a bit of audio and music, but mostly focus on the major features requisite of a vertical-slice styled prototype – animated models, environment, VFX and programming. Your support will aid in polishing &amp; continuing to develop this project, increasing social outreach, creating community and building an audience whose feedback will directly help improve this video game. Lastly, it will tell our future team that there are others who believe in and support this work, validating continued efforts on the journey so far.",
