    "About the game": "The 【 Happy Corp. 】 invites you to follow up on the story of one of the most ferocious abnormality: The Red Man. In this game, you control a human who heads to the world's darkest place. On this adventure you'll go through many rooms which you are free to explore at your own pace. There are two phases: the “going”, in which you can unlock red collectibles in each of the rooms; and the “return” which makes each room slightly change and so it's collectible . These collectables change the behaviour of the game. It may be a good idea to try to collect them all ! As you explore, the progress on every collectible will be shown on the screen. BUT BEWARE !! Getting a game over will close the game and restart your progress! Will you be able to overcome the darkness?

LOG: The Red Man. This abnormality is said to look like a giant humanoid wearing a red suit, have pale skin and no face. This creature seems to cause others to become violent when they're in pain, they can't control their actions once this happens.

There were very few cases reported before the first “encounter” at The Happy Corporation. Since then, more cases have come to light, though none have ever been solved. There has been one, very old, documented case of a child surviving an encounter with the “Red Man”, but no definitive answer seems likely to ever be found. This leads to the belief that the Red Man is simply a product of one's imagination or a hallucination. Most department leaders at The Happy Corporation agree that a “Red Man” could be a very dangerous and unpredictable abnormality of type “Atzilut”.
