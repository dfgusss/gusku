But after several years without news of him, the New York Herald newspaper sent the British explorer and journalist Henry Morton Stanley in search of him. His starting point: Zanzibar, on the east coast of Africa, the last place he was seen alive. Stanley, knowing the dangerous path, prepares himself for the many dangers that await him, such as wild animals, natural obstacles and anthropophagous tribes, among others. To avoid them, he carries his three favourite weapons with him, each of which has different attributes: the knife, a horizontally moving throwing object with a gravity fall, the boomerang with its classic movement and the grenades with a parabolic movement. In addition, you have your favourite pole with which you can jump over mountains and chasms.",
