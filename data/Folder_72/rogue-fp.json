    "About the game": "ROGUE-FP is a blend of old school classic roguelike gameplay with new school first person controls and perspective. There is no movement grid and no rigid turn system to slow you down. Synopsis The Fighters guild has a high bar for entry. They want you to delve deep into the Dungeon of Doom and return to the surface with the Amulet of Yendor. A perilous quest few have completed, for within the dungeon are terrible monsters, devious traps, and mystifying magical items. To survive you'll have to identify the items, navigate the dark labyrinths within the dungeon, and fight your way past the monsters. With enough skill and a decent amount of luck they say it can be done. Give it your best shot! Features Just like in the roguelike days of yore, there are Procedurally generated levels Perma-death An alphabet's worth of monsters Many magic items with different effects including rings, potions, wands, and more! But in ROGUE-FP there’s also Sprites/textures for everything First person controls Smooth turns Synth soundtrack A difficulty level for every level of skill, including one that removes item identification",
