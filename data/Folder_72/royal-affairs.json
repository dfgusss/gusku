    "About the game": "Return to the exclusive boarding schools of Creme de la Creme - this time as a royal! Work hard, study hard, and play hard as a royal in training at the exclusive Archambault Academy. Will you rule the roost, or be a royal disaster? Royal Affairs is an interactive novel by Hannah Powell-Smith, set in the world of Creme de la Creme . It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. As the middle child of a royal family, you've led a sheltered life in the palace, but now you must spread your wings and prepare for your royal responsibilities. Term is about to begin at Archambault Academy and it's time for your big entrance. Everyone knows your name, everyone has an opinion on what you do, and everyone views you as the face of the new generation of royalty. You’re being courted by every club and social group on campus; and there are countless students who would love to be your friend - or more. Meanwhile, outside your school’s ivy-covered walls, trouble simmers across the country as activists fight to open voting rights beyond the aristocracy. You can use your influence to sway the Parliament’s decision - but in which direction? Will you flaunt your fame, or retreat from the spotlight? And if you do seek publicity, will the papers love you or despise you? Will you honor centuries of royal tradition and follow the path that your mother the Queen has laid out for you, or be a force of change, leading your country in a new direction as you break free of the expectations laid on you all your life? How will you navigate intense family ties and political upheaval to come out on top? Oh, yes, and there’s also the foreign royal that your mother wants you to marry. Who is in your class. And who happens to hate you. Play as male, female, or non-binary; gay, straight, or bisexual; monogamous or polyamorous; asexual and/or aromantic. Cuddle and train your pet: a horse, dog, or bird of prey. Put on a lavish play, become a sports star, or run Student Council - and bring fame or disrepute to your school. Help fix your classmates' problems, or make them worse. Make a savvy political marriage, fall in love with the wrong person for the right reasons, or make friendships that will last for life. Help rebels work for a different future, or stamp them out with scheming and deceit. Will you embrace responsibility or forge your own path?",
