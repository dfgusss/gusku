    "About the game": "Get ready to hit the road and become the ultimate transportation tycoon in our latest game! In this low poly style car simulation game, you'll have the chance to build your own car collection, transport goods and people, and experience the thrill of a dynamic day-night cycle in an immersive open world map. With a variety of car types to choose from, including SUVs, mini trucks, and even heavy-duty trucks, there's never a dull moment as you navigate through different terrains and breakable meshes. As you level up, you'll unlock new cars and increase your income, making you a true master of the road. So, rev up your engines and get ready for the ride of a lifetime in our thrilling new game! Hop into your newly bought car: Bring out the Buy/Spawn Menu [Button T] to access all your cars and to add something new to your collection. Make sure to read the car details though and plan out your tradeoffs between expenditure and power. Choose between sedans and hatchbacks to carry your passengers whereas the rugged minivans and trucks are meant for rough use on the challenging terrains of SimPoly to carry the biggest of Cargos the world has to offer. Just keep in mind that some cargos are only meant for the mightiest of the hauling machines!! You can find cargo missions in specific locations spreadout across the map. These places show up on the minimap as you get closer or zoom out. The world doesn't just revolve around the idea of frantically shipping cargos but sometimes take a long breath, relax and enjoy the beauty of SimPoly. Just drive around in the vast world and merge yourself with the smoothly transitioning weather and day night system. Here you can see our player driving around sightsee...... Oh ok!! Never Mind! The Most Interesting Assignment Once you complete 5 missions to the post office construction site you will be appointed as their part time delivery driver. Go ahead and race through those narrow lanes while the clock is ticking. Isn't it always more fun when there is a real challenge and a real deadline!",
