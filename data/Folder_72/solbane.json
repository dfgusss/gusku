    "About the game": "Solbane is a boss-rush shoot 'em up that blends the retro arcade experience with modern RPG elements, preserving the arcade gameplay feel with upgraded modern visuals and modernized experience. Combat the Solar threat in this bullet hell space shooter! Journey throughout the solar system in a story-driven setting to eliminate 14 bosses, each with its own complex mechanics that will regularly demand a change of play style, strategy, and customization. Evolve your spacecraft and gameplay from a vast arsenal of over 50 abilities and three pilots, each with their own unique solutions to deal with the threats of the Solar system. Play as the Aggressor, Valkyrie, or Architect through a threatened system and bring an end to the solar destruction. Make your own ability build out of 50 abilities and hundreds of combinations which are designed to heavily alter your playstyle. Every boss is vastly different from one another, having different strengths and weaknesses, which will require you to adapt through trial and error . Build example #1: When playing as the Aggressor you can customize a melee-based build which involves getting very close and personal with the adversary. This class has a giant hammer attached on its front that can be rotated around the ship, making a devastating whirlwind. Coupled with other short-ranged abilities, it embraces a high risk high reward gameplay. Whirlwind your enemies until they are rubble! Build example #2: The Architect can have a rapid-fire playstyle by utilizing as many drones as possible. These drones are mini versions of the Architect and the more they can be generated, the more projectiles will be launched at your enemy. Strength in numbers is what this build is all about. It allows YOU to be the bullet hell.",
