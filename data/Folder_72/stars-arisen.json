    "About the game": "Reclaim your mother's lost throne with the mighty power of the skies! Bring down lightning on your foes, climb an endless tower, and call the ghosts of old foes to your aid. In this fantasy epic, how will you wield your magical birthright?* Stars Arisen is an interactive novel by Abigail C. Trevor. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. After a four-hundred-year reign, your mother, the immortal and all-powerful Sorceress of the Skies, was overthrown in a violent revolution. Called a tyrant and forced into exile, she was believed dead by all—except you, her secret child and chosen heir. Now, as the Sorceress's life bleeds away, she has given you a task: steal back the fallen stars that granted her power and reclaim her crown. With the last vestiges of your mother's magic in your hands, you'll descend for the first time to the city she left behind and discover how it's reshaped itself in her absence. The rebels who cast it down feud over its governance, and rioters in the street grasp at the remnants of sorcery in the city's secret corners. Seeing the rising new world, do you still intend to fulfill your mother's ancient vision? Will you restore the Sorceress's might, shatter it for good, or claim it for yourself?
