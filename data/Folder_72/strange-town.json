    "About the game": "Main Idea 'Strange Town' is a multiplayer survival-themed role-playing game. The main objective of the game is to find and punish the traitor, and go to the 'Exit Points' of this magical world to leave it, as the world slowly deteriorates and toxic gas clouds start to cover the map. At the same time, one or two players will become Werewolves, posing another challenge for the innocent players to overcome. ▶▶ FEATURES: ▶ WEREWOLVES : The primary objective of Werewolves is to sabotage the innocent players' exit from the map or, after consuming enough meat, to turn into a Werewolf and slaughter all the innocent players. ▶ Chests : Open the randomly appearing chests on the map and collect special items to strengthen yourself. ▶ Meat : Some meats that appear in certain areas can only be eaten by traitors. REMEMBER! If a traitor eats enough meat, they can turn into a Werewolf. Keep your eyes peeled and if you see someone eating meat, alert the others! ▶ Open World Quests : There are several skeleton camps located in many different parts of the map. These camps provide you with mission items or high-quality, enhanced items if you manage to kill all the skeletons in the camp. ▶ Map : Players start in the first stage of the map, which involves killing skeletons in skeleton camps to collect key pieces. Only with these key pieces can players progress to the second stage, which contains the exit points that allow innocent players to end the game. STRANGE TOWN is a fantastic game to play with your friends. Add it to your wish list and let your friends know!",
