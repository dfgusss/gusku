Inspired by FTL, this subnautic student project serves as our first 2-semester release. In Subtension, YOU get to man the helm and run your own submarine through missions in deep waters. Do you have what it takes? It won't be easy, as you come across all sorts of different problems requiring different solutions. Defeat enemy vessels and upgrade your sub. Your choices dictate your path in this story-focused experience with multiple endings. Will you be able to reach port? It's all up to what kind of captain you'll be.

Try again with different choices to experience multiple endings to the story - Fully integrated achievements - Rich gameplay experience and atmosphere - Steam remote cloud Subtension was created by 40 people across two teams at the University of Michigan's WolverineSoft Studio, a student games studio undertaking semester long projects. It is an educational case study of Subset Game's FTL: Faster Than Light, and takes inspiration from its game mechanics as well as other games in the genre. Work on this project took place between May and December 2022. This project represents the studio's first 2-semester long project, the prototype produced by the Summer team can be found here on our steam page.",
