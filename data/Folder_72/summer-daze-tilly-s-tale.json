    "About the game": "Sign up for a semester at Hero University, a school where famous adventurers teach young people how to be heroes! You are Tilly Appleberry, a Rogue student who values people and fun above rules and authority. A fantastic voice cast stars Zehra Fazal (Voltron: Legendary Defender; Young Justice: Outsiders) as Tilly. The focus is on the story and quirky fantasy characters. You'll meet a Minotaur Paladin, a Doggie Chef, and many more potential friends and love interests. Suitable for all ages, Tilly's Tale is a story full of humor and heart. Summer Daze: Tilly's Tale combines the best elements of visual novels and adventure games, offering players multiple paths and control over Tilly's actions as she navigates her challenging semester as a rogue at Hero-University. Your choices matter - There are multiple endings and hundreds of paths through the game! Play again (and again!) to make friends with more characters and make a more successful festival. Corey and Lori Cole have been designing games for over 30 years, at Sierra Online and now at their independent studio Transolar Games. They were the pioneers behind the adventure/roleplaying hybrid, combining computer roleplaying games with graphical adventures. They’ve previously worked on the Quest for Glory series, Castle of Doctor Brain, Terry Brooks’s Shannara, and Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption. Our talented team features JP Selwood on background art and animation and Al Eufrasio on character design. Brandon Blume created the original soundtrack. Programming in Unity and Ink by Cidney Hamilton and Philip Elder. Summer Daze: Tilly's Tale is the first game in a new series of interactive visual novels set at Hero-U, the home of Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption .",
