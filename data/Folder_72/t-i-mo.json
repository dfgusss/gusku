    "About the game": "T.I.MO is the result of our way in which everyone watches the world around us and how its potentiated when we are children. Triaventuras is a 2D puzzles game point and click, where the gamer shall control three characters and according to each way of watching every reality must solve the puzzle (riddles) for helping the monsters for return their homes The core Mechanic is based on the idea that every child watches the world in his/her own and unique way. Therefore, the world changes depending on which character the player selects in order to show how this child watches the objects of the world. The player must use the 3 different visions of the world, in order to solve each puzzle. The solution is always in sight, but requires the right point of view. The 3 main characters will meet with the 'Mohan'; a mythological being, who has lost his powers, because the people of that region had to move out of town. No one believes in Mohan anymore. He even lost his magic items in the moving-out chaos. Mao, Pao, and Clau will have to find and recover the three Mohan´s magic items, so he can finally return to the river where he belongs.",
