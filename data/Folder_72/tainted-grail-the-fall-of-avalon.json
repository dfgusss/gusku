Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a dark fantasy, open world RPG full of quests, loot, choices and monsters, set on a bleak island on the verge of ruin. King Arthur is long dead and all the myths and legends are falling. Humans living in Avalon are desperately trying to find new ways of life and things to believe in. The plague of Red Death and the spreading Wyrdness are not helping. Time is running out and multiple factions have their own plan for the future of the island… In this realm, slowly but surely sinking into chaos, you find yourself imprisoned in a damp, underground cell. At this point, you’re nobody, but who knows - you might just be the one who brings a spark of change to this land of everlasting Autumn. FEATURES: True open world experience Find unexpected quests and adventures on every inch of the island and roam it without constraints. Explore hidden caves and dungeons, roam ancient ruins and travel through the Wyrdness itself. Find secrets big and small and piece them all together. Explore the dark world of Tainted Grail The mysterious and complex story of Tainted Grail spans over 1,000 years, from the moment King Arthur led the people of the Homelands to the shores of Avalon. Journey through Avalon to uncover the dark secrets behind the Age of Conquest, Fore-Dwellers, and the Wyrdness itself. The game is inspired by and based on the lore of the board game of the same name, which was created by one of Poland's best fantasy writers - Krzysztof Piskorski. Customize your character Face enemies the way you choose. Whether you want to strike from the shadows, use bows and daggers, fight face to face using cold steel, or use forbidden rites of the druids - you’re free to decide. Create your own, unique style and challenge the monsters of Avalon. Make friends and enemies During your journey, you’ll encounter simple commoners, battle-worn soldiers, and even gods of old in need of your assistance. You’ll have to make choices in a world in which there are no good answers, but your decisions matter and your choices are respected. Trade, craft, cook The game will come with many supporting systems that will allow you to use all of the gathered ingredients and transform them into useful items, life-saving potions or food. Coming prepared in this land, engulfed in the misty Wyrdness, is the key to survival.",
