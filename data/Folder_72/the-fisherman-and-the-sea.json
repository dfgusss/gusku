    "About the game": "The world of No-Lens has drowned and with it went the land, people, and stories that came before. Many ages have passed and those that survived have done so clustered together on disparate islands. Venturing from an island is a thing of taboo, only for pirates and the foolhardy. The Fisherman, however, has grown up on the sea and is the captain of his own dinky rust boat that he uses for fishing and the occasional ferry service for the brave islander. Take control of the Fisherman as they set out to explore this dreary drowned world and restore the joy of adventure across the seas… Explore, fish, hunt for treasure, and help the islanders find their bravery to explore the seas once again.",
