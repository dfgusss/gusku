    "About the game": "Vertigo 2 is a single-player adventure built from the ground up for VR. Deep underground in the reaches of Quantum Reactor VII, you awake to finish your journey home. You’ll have to face bizarre alien flora and fauna leaking from other universes - and deadly android security forces whose job is to purge the reactor of all life. Try to determine who to trust as sinister agents lurk just out of sight. Key features include: Huge, bespoke world design – an incredible range of environments makes Vertigo 2 much more of an adventure than Vertigo 1. Enemy variety – dozens of creatures and robots are waiting to be discovered. Hybrid locomotion – both smooth locomotion and teleportation are viable. State of the art VR weapons – carry an arsenal of 14 weapons, all with unique reload mechanics. Fully voiced characters – a diverse cast brings the many characters of Vertigo 2 to life. Original soundtrack – hours of original songs and scoring. Intense boss fights – Vertigo is notorious for its ambitious boss encounters, and Vertigo 2 brings 10 brand new bosses. Substantial campaign – 18 chapters long, Vertigo 2’s story has many times as much content as Vertigo 1.",
