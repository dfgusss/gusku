    "About the game": "A romantic comedy visual novel that occurs one winter in a snowy country town. FEATURES 20+ hours of story Three branching heroine routes Full Japanese voice acting by seasoned professionals SUMMARY This is the story of a single season— Minamiouse is one of Japan's smallest towns, located in one of its most frigid regions. This year's snows are the earliest they've come in decades. There's change in the air, for better or worse. With two months left on the calendar, both of them looking wintry, Munefuyu plans to spend the time with his friends just like always. There's the taciturn, direct, and somewhat wild Miku, his childhood companion who's just covering up her kindness. The shy and eccentric exchange student, Svetlana, is fresh off the plane from Russia but no stranger to the cold. Meanwhile, the transfer student Kako Takahagi has known Munefuyu forever, but he's forgotten her... Luckily, his best friend and confidante Hironaka has his back. This winter won't be long, but it won't be forgotten, and every everyday moment it will look like a miracle in the rear-view mirror. It's where we've been and where we're going.",
