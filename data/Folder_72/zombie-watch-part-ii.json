    "About the game": "Welcome to the world of Zombie Watch Part II! You have been extremely lucky so far. You survived a virus that has infected most of the population and turned them into flesh-eating zombies. They may be dead but they are still walking and will come after you. There are no rules - do what you need to do to survive! Zombie Watch Part II is a first-person, open-world survival game in a post-apocalyptic world with zombies and wildlife. Gather, mine, scavenge for resources, and take your base - which is totally safe and fenced this time - to the next level. You have nothing left which is why you have to go on raids to different parts of the world for resources, food, water, and more. On each of these runs, you will need to carefully decide what will you be bringing home with you, that is - if you make it out alive. Whatever useful stuff you find you can sell to the traders and buy what you need in order to survive. Enjoy the adventure! STORY You live in a post-apocalyptic world ruled by bloodthirsty zombies. They can smell you from the distance, hear every step you take, and will make you their one and only target once they spot you. While living in a secure base you really have nothing else left. Because of your actions from the past you were left behind and do not belong anywhere and never will. You are your only hope for survival. While going on resource runs you also have to attend to your basic human needs. It would be a shame if you perished from starvation or thirst. Choose your destinations wisely and get the most out of each resource run you take. FEATURES You can explore a fragmented world.
