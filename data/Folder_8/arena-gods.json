    "About the game": "Welcome to the Arena! ARENA GODS® is Spectacle Combat , a top-down, arena fighting game where two to four gladiators compete to be the last one standing in an anything goes deathmatch spectacle. You are gladiator. Brave the arena and win the crowd to seize godhood! Key Features Fight armed or unarmed, strike or throw, standing or on the ground. Every object can be picked up, wielded as a weapon, and thrown as a projectile. Projectiles can be deflected or caught in mid air. Most weapons kill in a single hit, but all can be disarmed. Each weapon is unique with specific strengths and weaknesses. The arena shifts and changes each round. Prologue The gates of the Colosseum open! To be a gladiator in these times is to be one amongst untold thousands. It is to be bound to the bloodiest sport imaginable. It is a game you can play today, if you dare. Forget certainty, for on the Sands anything and everything can happen. Forget mercy, for in the Arena you will find none, only an endless cycle of conflict and carnage, and the thirsting roar of the Mob.",
