    "About the game": "ASPEN: Uncanny Home is a first-person horror game that features a heavy focus on story and exploration. The player can only move and zoom in. The game is designed to be difficult and does not make big changes like most games do. The player's actions will make small changes. the story is about deserted residential streets. Explore with phycological fears. The secrets of the tragedy will gradually become clear through your exploration and imagination. This story proceeds in fragments like wandering back and forth between times and dredge a river. At the same time, memories are recalled, the process itself is depicted. While gaining a foothold, create a foothold at the same time. Eventually, an absurd story will be completed. The fundamental absurdity of this world appears as a chasm. Reality exists only in that part of the world. The Curse Will Never abandon You.",
