    "About the game": "Once arch enemies, the US and Russia abandon their space race and unite their forces in the face of impending alien attack. Combining to form the elite International Space Defence Force, they recruit you to help lead resistance, before total devastation is unleashed on the human race. The solar system is at war. Take command. Battlezone: Combat Commander remasters FPS-RTS classic Battlezone II with slick new visuals, brand new achievements, Steam Workshop support and much more! Fight across 24 intense missions, over 6 exotic living worlds, scavenging the battlefield for crucial bio-metal used to create powerful units, towering defenses, and vital facilities. COMMAND A BATTALION Control of over 30 unique unit types, from lethal tanks and tough ground units, to towering walkers and relentless air-support, and face off against the enemy in intense first-person combat. ADVANCED AI Units learn and improve as they gain combat experience - new units fight like recruits, while experienced units are a lot more effective in combat, using strafing manoeuvres, choosing weapons to suit the situation, or even retreating when necessary. REMASTERED VISUALS Experience Battlezone: Combat Commander like never before, with an all new DX11 renderer, shader based rendering, and a completely retextured and upscaled terrain. GO HEAD TO HEAD Invite your friends for a cross-play multiplayer experience, including the classic Deathmatch mode, and a co-operative mode ‘MPI’ where players must work together to win by managing their offence, defence, and scrap collection. MOD SUPPORT Enjoy unique community generated content with support for mods, such as new singleplayer and multiplayer map mods, new vehicles, HUDs, assets, custom scripts and much more.",
