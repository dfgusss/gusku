    "About the game": "'The Boomer Slayers come to purge the world of filth and bring masculinity and brutality back to society' BOOMER SLAYERS is an indie game by a single developer. It is a mix of an old-school hardcore gameplay and modern low-poly looks with boomer humor. Use your BADASS character to clear The Building by using brute force! Use your JUSTICE PUNSH to interact with enemies and environment. Upgrade your S-KILLS to own your enemies with style! Use MONETOS to buy stylish colors for your hero! Play with your badass friends in local co-op mode! Try to do your best not to die of laughter. When you're ready, switch from GAME JOURNALIST DIFFICULTY to NORMAL (or even VERY NORMAL) and test your might in a REAL CHALLENGE. Slay your enemies LIKE A BOSS! (Some in-game jokes may be understandable only to native Russians)",
