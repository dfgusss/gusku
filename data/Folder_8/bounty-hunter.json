    "About the game": "In the game, you are a bounty hunter, and your daily job is to take on all kinds of monster hunting tasks to earn commissions. Now the northern town of SnowField has been attacked by wolves. Many bounty hunters have been there and no return, and you have also received an invitation from the mayor. In view of the shyness in the bag, you decided to go and explore it. You can use all kinds of weapons to fight in the game. Different weapons have different operational effects. You can use the trophies you get from killing monsters in exchange for money. The game uses a special food pattern, so that food is no longer a chicken rib but a must. Food doesn't directly revert to your blood volume, it restores your energy. All of your recovery in the game consumes energy, and when you run out of energy, all of your recovery will drop to a very low level. More details would like you to experience in the game.",
