    "About the game": "Rules Of the Game For each caught egg the player is given one point. First, the eggs roll slowly, but the pace of the game is accelerating gradually. Every 20 and 30 scored points the pace of the game slows down a bit. In the case the egg falls, the player is given a penalty point, which is indicated by a chicken - it will appear on the box on your right. If it occurs in the presence of a kitten, which appears in the box on your left, then the player is given a half of the penalty point - on the box on your right appears an egg instead of the chicken. Every 20 and 30 of caught eggs the penalty points will be cancelled. After receiving three penalty points (from three to six eggs fell down), the game stops. The game has two difficulty levels and mode Time Attack. In the simple mode, the eggs start to roll only by three trays at the same time. In the hard mode on all four trays and the fourth tray is located behind you! In Time Attack mode eggs will roll by 3 trays for three minutes, every second quicker – you should lose as few eggs as possible. Test your dexterity! Catch as many eggs as you can!",
