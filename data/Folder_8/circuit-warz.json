    "About the game": "Probably the hardest electronics game you will ever play, only good engineers need apply. Please note: The game is a form of assessment which tests your understanding of basic electronic circuits. To complete the game successfully you need to understand the operation of Series Parallel Resistor circuits, Resistor Capacitor (RC) filters, Graetz Bridges, Wheatstone bridges, Weighted summing amplifiers, Transistor switches and Oscillator circuits. 20 minutes to save the Earth Save the planet in a desperate race against time and an invading alien horde... The planet is under threat from an alien invader, their ship is approaching fast. The laser protection system on Moon Base Alpha has been sabotaged… You have minutes to fix the circuits, repair the generator, fire the laser and save the world. Only good engineers need apply… Knowledge is everything! Circuit Warz Seven complete levels to assess your knowledge of basic electronic circuits including Series Parallel Resistor circuits, Resistor Capacitor (RC) filters, Graetz Bridges, Wheatstone bridges, Weighted summing amplifiers, Transistor switches and Oscillator circuits. Learn basic electronic circuits in a new and exciting way. Topics covered include Current and Voltage Resistance and Resistors Capacitance and Capacitors Alternating Current Semiconductors Transistors Diodes Ohms Law Equivalent resistance Electronics Circuits Simulator is now available for free on STEAM and complements the Circuit Warz game. It allows you to practice each of the 7 levels without any time constraints or enemies before you play the main game.",
