    "About the game": "This project combines graphics by Hiroshi “Mr. Dotman” Ono, the artist behind such Namco classics as Dig Dug, Xevious, and Mappy, and sound by Yuzo Koshiro , composer of Streets of Rage, The Revenge of Shinobi, and Shenmue, to complete an arrange version in 1980s arcade style. Like fools, we rely on games offered for our favorite platforms that are published in magazines, but lately, they seem to have all become so simple, demanding too little of the player’s intelligence and creativity. Now a game has been created that makes us stand up and cry, “Let’s do this!!' This quote is from an article announcing Cosmic Cavern. Cosmic Cavern was published in the July 1980 issue of I/O Magazine in Japan. As the article illustrates, Space Cavern was extremely addictive because it allowed players to express their imaginations, was densely packed with pure fun, and was highly innovative. It gained incredible popularity and was ported to a wide range of 8-bit computers of that era. In addition to the original version, this masterpiece compiles two arranged versions that modify frustrating parts of the original with modern gameplay, in addition to enhanced features and two-player co-op. That’s three games in one! Hiroshi 'Mr.Dotman' Ono drew graphocs of these games and many more.
