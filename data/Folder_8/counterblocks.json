    "About the game": "CounterBlocks is an arcade-like rebellious block-breaking game that combines simple block-breaking and non-simple counter bullets. Game Rule Hit the ball and break all the blocks! Block is rebellious guys. If it's destroyed, they'll fire bullets. Even if you fail to reflect the ball, it is not a miss, but ball is rebellious too. It'll fire bullets from floor. If the ▲ hits a bullet, it's a miss. Story Any video game historian would not be able to ignore that times. That revolutions was in the USA in 1976. Solo play, score attacks, challenging the player's own limitations... Some argue that this set the mainstream for later play styles. In the following year, the revolution crossed the Pacific Ocean and landed in Japan. The game was transformed into a table type game and deployed in cafes, and is said to have laid the foundation for the invasion of the more following year by the 'Invaders from space'. The times that later came to be known as 'The first block-breaking boom' in Japan. However, many historians are not known the existence of counter forces. 'WE WON'T BE BROKEN DOWN!' * This story is a fictitious. Any similarity to actual games, is purely coincidental.",
