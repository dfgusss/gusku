    "About the game": "Robots launched an attack on humans! You must stop them! Hello, I am a personal developer who develops the games I want to achieve by continually learning programming knowledge. 'Cover Sky' is a fast-paced (small map) single-player shooting game that can switch between first and third person perspective at any time. I hope this game is small but detailed. I really like the dynamic environment design in the game. When the rain comes, the battlefield will be wet by the rain. The sound of rain heard in the house is different from that outside the house. It is this kind of idea that leads me to design the dynamic environment in the game. I am very grateful for the feedback and bug report. Thank you for taking a moment to read this, I really hope you enjoy this game. 仿生梦 The first/third person perspective can be switched at any time! Quick start in ten seconds, small map, end in fifteen minutes. Two game modes, team fight and grenade fight. Four different styles of battlefield maps and customizable AI quantities(20, 30, 40). 9 weapons (including melee). Low Poly style game. Fast game rhythm, suitable for any time. Dynamic environment, including weather, sound effects. Easy to learn game, smooth game operation experience. Steam achievements support! Steam cloud support. Now available in Chinese, English, Russian, German, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Polish, and Turkish.",
