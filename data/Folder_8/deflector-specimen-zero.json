    "About the game": "&gt;Deflector Experiment Log ██25 &gt;Sample designation: Specimen 0 &gt;Test type: Controlled injection into isolated viral environment via [DATA CORRUPT] &gt; &gt;Summary: Specimen based on DNA of [DATA CORRUPT] was deployed against the virus per logged instructions. This is deployment number ██ of ██. Deflection of viral projectiles: Success. Elimination of viral organisms: Success. Accelerated evolution based on absorbed DNA: Successful. If Specimen survives prolonged insertion in a controlled environment, the Deflector experiment will be able to proceed to [DATA CORRUPT]. Preliminary results are promising. Recommend Specimen Zero designation: Eradicator Deflector is a high-octane roguelite where you can turn the bullet hell tide against your enemies. In Deflector: Specimen Zero you play as Eradicator. Armed with an oversized boomerang it’s a prototype sample of a potential cure to a deadly virus. You are injected into a microcosm where hostile terrain and numerous aggressive viral organisms await. Try out Eradicator’s play style and clear Specimen Zero to get a unique Eradicator skin. Strike a mean figure in both Deflector: Specimen Zero and the main Deflector game. Zero is only the beginning. The experiment must go on. When you’re caught between projectiles and a hard place - your only way out is to deflect! Send back everything thrown at you and finally turn the tables on the bullet hell genre! Combine upgrades to unlock powerful abilities and discover unique combinations in a free-form upgrade system. Create explosive clones, duplicate deflected projectiles, or even rupture the ground itself!",
