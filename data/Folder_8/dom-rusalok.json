    "About the game": "Russia in the ‘90s. A provincial town on the outskirts of the crumbling Soviet Empire. A big yard where many kids hang out. They make friends, fight and reconcile, love and hate, but mostly just play. Life goes on as usual until one kid mysteriously goes missing, and the rest of the group has to face the horror they are unable to comprehend – the DØM RUSALOK. This is a place where the worst nightmares come true. DØM RUSALOK – is a story that follows the traditions of great works by Stephen King and Robert Stine. It is a story about children who have to face a disturbing horror. Only this time action does not take place in cozy suburban America but at cellars, basements and yards of provincial 90’s Russia. The post-soviet russian setting gives the game a unique atmosphere like no other. It creates a space where no one can hear your scream. A number of challenges awaits the children who are about to discover the deepest darkest secrets hidden away in a human soul. A homicidal maniac is on the loose, while the street gangs thrive under the police protection. A cult with a TV psychic medium leader grows in popularity among the people. However, most importantly, at the heart of an abandoned research institute, which the town was originally built around, a somewhat chthonic power is about to awaken. WARNING: DOM RUSALOK contains imagery that may be harmful to players with photosensitive epilepsy or similar condition",
