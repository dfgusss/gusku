    "Name": "Drizzlepath: Deja Vu",
    "Release date": "May 25, 2018",
    "About the game": "“Memory is an oddly circuitous thing, often dancing in its own circles. A snake perpetually eating its own tail. We can sometimes swear we’ve seen something before, in another life. Echoes of another existence, so familiar and yet…we’ve never been here before, have we?” A man embarks on a journey toward the top of a mountain, to discover the truth of his existence. Along the way, he ponders the nature of life itself. Drizzlepath: Deja Vu is a spiritual revisitation of Tonguç Bodur's very first game, Drizzlepath. Not so much a remake as a re-envisioning, as well as a celebration of the many games he has made since. A relaxing “walking simulator”, in which events are triggered not through interaction with objects, but through exploring Tonguç Bodur’s tenth game on Steam, and a homage to his very first game from 2015 Neither a sequel nor a remake, but a standalone experience with bonus in-references for those familiar with his earlier games Professional voice narration, atmospheric sound design, and a dynamic music score A playtime of thirty to sixty minutes, with a thorough playthrough required to discover all of the game’s secrets A single sprawling level, broken up into several save points A rich and thought-provoking narrative, co-written by Bottle: Pilgrim and Nephise: Ascension author Michael Bowser Save progression: The game saves your progression at each checkpoint location automatically. When it is saved, an icon appears at the top corner of the screen. PS: The core aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is recommended for those who mostly seek to experience the mood.",
