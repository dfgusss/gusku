    "About the game": "EGG FLY is a vertical platformer based on physics. All you need is a mouse, control the distance between the mouse and the character and lead the character all the way up to the top by clicking at a reasonable pace. Game play The movement and jump of the character is based on physics, so you need to have good control of the position and rhythm of the click to control the movement and jump of the character. Level design We carefully designed different types of levels, from the easy to the deep, step by step the challenge of high difficulty. The background music We carefully selected a variety of background music, to help you relax, more happy to play the game. Subsequent progress We will continue to update new chapters with new themes and new challenges. If you want to change the mouse, but do not have a good excuse, please start the game as soon as possible. If you want to test your patience and don't have a testing tool, start playing as soon as possible. If you want to learn about physics, err.......... Go to school, please.",
