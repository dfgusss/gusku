    "About the game": "End it, please ... is a casual and challenging platformer game. You have crashed on an unknown planet and you will pass through enemies, environments to find your ship and escape. Your journey will not be easy, very few will reach the end and discover their new crews members. Play with either keyboard or controller Run and jump your way through a (very) long map Pass enemies, activate buttons and use pick-ups items to go further than your last game Unlock 4 additional skins for your character Chose between 2 different voices for your character Beat the game in normal mode if you can, but don't worry, there is also an easier mode Feel new shades of frustration that you didn't know existed Be careful, some things are hidden in plain sight while others seem real but are nothing more than illusions. Will you give up ? Will you beat the game and save your crew ?",
