    "About the game": "Firekeep is a minimalist, relaxing strategy game about building a tiny, sustainable city in the cold void of space. Build, combine and upgrade dozens of unique buildings to overcome procedurally-generated islands and keep your fire burning. Enjoy a relaxing yet strategically deep experience where a single run can be completed quickly, but new islands and new building combinations will keep you starting new runs over and over again! Check out what's in store next: Firekeep is all about making the most of your limited space. Each tile can support one building, and each building produces and requires different resources. Once a building has access to all the resources it needs, it upgrades into a new building that produces new, additional resources. The catch? Buildings can only send and receive resources to and from the tiles right next to them. Firekeep contains over 50 unique buildings for players to discover on their quest to build the central beacon, plus special projects that will change the very fabric of your island. That said, the game is currently in a very early state, so feel free to send bugs to us on Twitter, or follow for news and updates!",
