We are shipwrecked on an unknown land! Several members of the crew are dead. The ship was driven onto land. The sailors managed to take it apart and put up a camp. We are very far from our homeland... I'm afraid we are stuck here for long. We haven't got much food. We should send someone to check out the surroundings and gather some food. The crew is counting on you! Our fate depends on your decisions!",
