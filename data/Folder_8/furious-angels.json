    "About the game": "FEATURES Fight against waves of increasing difficulty, randomized on each day. Airborne upgrades, transform into a flying tank! Compete on the daily leaderboards to become the most furious. Rank up on each new day and unlock specific achievements. Simple controls, you can play with one hand. Hard to master. Modular destruction of the bigger ships gives you the tactical edge. Ram the enemy! HOW DOES IT PLAY? The recommended way to play Furious Angels is with the mouse: aim, fire with the left button, thrust with the right button and hold your fire to repair . Thats it. You can also use a more familiar twin-stick control scheme with your Gamepad OR Mouse + WASD. LEADERBOARDS? Absolutely, but there's a catch: everything will reset the next day with a rank upgrade and new waves , a fresh start. WHAT ABOUT THE UPGRADES? As you shred the enemy to pieces your ship will transform and upgrade automatically. There are four upgrade stages, each with its own unique weapon. Upgrades can level up and be obtained multiple times but each time they will be harder to get. How furious will you become?",
