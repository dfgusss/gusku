    "About the game": "After the update, this game has been upgraded to a tower defense confrontation game with the concept of 'face' games as the core. The 8-player melee mode is currently open, I hope everyone likes it. Game introduction 'Summon &amp; Fusion' is a turn-based game. Each round you will get spar based on the enemies defeated in the previous round, and consume the spar to summon the Valkyries to appear on the stage, regardless of whether they defeat the invading enemy. Summon Valkyrie Through the summon button, you can consume the spar to summon the Valkyrie. The summoner will select a random Valkyrie from the team to be summoned and appear in a random position. The cost of the summoning will increase by 10 points after each use. Upgrade Valkyrie If you summon two of the same Valkyrie, you can drag them to form a stronger two-star Valkyrie. A Valkyrie can synthesize up to seven stars at most. Random cards After successfully defending the enemy's invasion each round, the store will randomly refresh three cards that can be used to strengthen the current hero. Choose the card you want to use, and it will be strengthened to the corresponding Valkyrie. Fight for the spoils Defeating an enemy has a probability of dropping black loot, and picking it up will randomly get usable loot items. Use props to activate prop effects and influence the trend of the battle. Props Each player has up to three unused items, and each item will take effect at the beginning of the next round, and the item will disappear after it is used.",
