    "About the game": "Ghost Platoon is a fast-paced, easy-to-pick-up, PvP First Person Shooter with stunning visuals. Built with Unreal Engine 4, this game places emphisis on gunplay and map design. Read the environment and take down your enemy before they get the chance to get you! Thought-out, handcrafted maps Village: A small town in peace, it would be a shame if someone would ruin it. Storm: Can you hear the thunder? Along streets and back alleys or tight indoor parts, learn to master the transition from close quarter combat to long-range shooting. Crosspoint: Set around a central crosspoint with a crashed helicopter, tanks and destroyed buildings, this truly a war-torn town. Depot: What is stored in this depot far out in the desert? Garage: Water is dripping from the ceiling, trash in every corner. This parking garage has seen better days. Temple: An ancient temple with tight corridors and a large central courtyard. Sunset: Welcome to paradise! A large tropical island with bamboo huts, suspension bridges, thick vegetation and sandy beaches. Container: The obvious map required in each shooter. Ideal for a hot brawl. Trainyard: This large industrial train yard offers large spaces and several accessible buildings. Treehouse: Snipe your opponent from a treehouse high above the ground. Backalley: Fight between two apartments on each side of a parking lot. Diverse weaponry Master a variety of modern-combat weaponry like Pistols, SMGs, Shotguns and Assault Rifles.
