    "About the game": "Mr. Fisk has been taken! Finding himself in a completely unknown location, Mr. Fisk must make his way up a mountain to get back home to his lake, but climbing is a challenge for a salmon not used to moving on dry land. Go Home, Mr. Fisk! is a challenging (im)precision platformer, where a single mistake may bring you all the way back to the beginning. Mr. Fisk is a clumsy and poorly maneuverable fish out of water, faced with the task of finding his way up a surreal mountain inhabited by other sea life. There are a number of equally valid routes up, the way you climb is up to you! Explore the mountain for secrets and routes leading forward. Features: Simple yet challenging platforming mechanics. A dynamic soundtrack that changes alongside your progress. Hats and other similar accessories to find and equip on Mr. Fisk. Secrets, references, and dumb jokes to discover and enjoy. Two proper endings, as well as another poorly hidden one to find. Steam Achievements. An unbeatable price of no cost! The entire game is available for free, the optional support DLC simply adds one more visual accessory to the game and earns our undying gratitude.",
