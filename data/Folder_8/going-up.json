    "About the game": "Going Up? is the first of it's kind, Indie tower-climber RPG. Head up a floor to fight, or go back down to regroup and item up. The choice is yours, but you must decide wisely. One item could mean riches gained, while another will only lead to death! Godfreyluck Game's debut: Going Up?, contains all the traditional elements of an RPG with a new twist. The intricate item typing system forces a player to choose their items carefully, giving this game a bit of a puzzler twist. We've also included upgrades for armor and skills, as well as a store. Now out of Early Access!",
