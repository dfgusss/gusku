The game was made by students at SMU Guildhall who are graduating in May, 2020 during the height of the Covid-19 outbreak. This is a difficult time for everyone. We decided to make Goofballs and our other recent releases free for two reasons: 1) With a challenging job market, we wanted to show off the students' hard work to as wide an audience as possible. 2) Everyone stuck at home could use some fun, free entertainment. If you are one of the gamers who supported our students and purchased the game, we thank you . Proceeds go directly to the students to help offset some of the extra development costs of making and publishing the game.",
