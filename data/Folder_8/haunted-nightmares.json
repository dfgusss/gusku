    "About the game": "“You learned to run from what you feel, and that's why you have nightmares. To deny is to invite madness. To accept is to control.” (Megan Chance) Haunted Nightmares is a top down game that puts you into nightmares in which you are hunted by „ Shadows “. These nightmares are your personal labyrinth. You have to know them to escape them and wake up in a 'Fresh Bed' - if you can find it ... But to find this bed (in this labyrinth with locked doors, hidden keys and all the shadows behind you ...) is not enough: You can only wake up there, if you find the ' Three Orbs of Beautiful Memories ', hidden in these nightmares. If a 'shadow' spots you, it will hunt you - it will not give up ! And no matter how many chase you, you have to find a way out of your nightmare. Once discovered - no way to hide … So you have to run… And you will be discovered - as it always is in nightmares. The question is how well do you know your nightmares - your personal nightly labyrinth. If you get to know your dreams, you will find a place to awaken peacefully. Despite all the doors, hidden keys, wrong ways and sticky soil. Maybe it won't always be easy. But a mastered nightmare will never haunt you again. KEY ELEMENTS Find the hidden 'Three Orbs of Beautiful Memories' Find the right keys for the right doors - don't open the wrong ones And try desperately to get out of this nightmare - despite the ongoing haunting  Keep an eye on your stamina - you can't run forever Keep an eye on your vitality - the 'shadows' will try to steal it from you",
