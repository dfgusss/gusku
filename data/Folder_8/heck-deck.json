Heck Deck main features: 5 different levels with their own music A cute hand-drawn art style One unique setting for each level Dozens of attacks and spells for the player Over 30 enemies and bosses A card purchase system via the shop The strategy created by the use of cards mixed with the dexterity required during the bullet hell phases makes Heck Deck truly unique!
