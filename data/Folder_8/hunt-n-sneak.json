    "About the game": "LIGHT IS BOTH FRIEND AND FOE Light is both friend and foe in Hunt ‘n Sneak – a manic party game set in a world where mystical creatures dwell. Threatened by the fearsome Gobblers, the Pixies’ struggle for survival has begun. Will you use your wit to sneak past the Gobblers, or use your cunning to hunt the elusive Pixies? Players controlling the Pixies must use spatial memory to navigate the maps; all the while anticipating the enemies moves to avoid the clutches of the Gobbler! Fortunately, Pixies are able to emit a Ping, which briefly reveals them by illuminating their surroundings. But be careful, you never know who might be watching, and a Gobbler may soon be hot on your trail! Players controlling the Gobbler must hunt down the Pixies, capturing them all to successfully absorb their power. Thrilling chases will soon have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Questions will fill the gap between friends. Where am I? Is the Gobbler nearby? Am I safe? Am I walking continually into a wall? Am I even alive?? FEATURES: Online and local multiplayer supporting 2 to 4 players. Travelling across the Pixie kingdoms you will: - Traverse the depths of the Glittering Caverns - Become enchanted within an Amethyst Forest - Roam the House of Horrors - Explore the Citadel of Shadows - Sneak through the Infernal Wastes Game modes: Ping - Pixies must survive long enough so that the Gobbler exhausts its power. Stockpile - Gather up all the Moon Drop essence before the Gobbler has a chance to pounce! Cursed - The Gobbler curse is passed from Pixie-to-Pixie. Spend the least amount of time under its evil influence to win! Each character possesses a unique ability, these include: wormhole teleportation, autonomous familiars, disguise and many more. Play with whatever is comfortable; controller or keyboard.",
