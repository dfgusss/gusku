    "About the game": "Tune yourself to the voices lurking in the head of John Blake - the tormented man dwelling in a trap… that only you can guide him out of. You start your adventure by waking up in an unknown place, not remembering what happened and how you got there. Your only companion is a mystery voice that guides you through a previously unknown world and what’s more, is the only main factor that can reveal your past. Inner Voices is an adventure game with a non-linear plot, procedurally generated user path and (more than) a pinch of the atmosphere of your favorite horrors. To find out more about John Blake’s past, you will need to solve various logic puzzles and the only way to regain the memories is to follow the unknown voice in your head. You will be constantly searching for a way to escape the randomised maze of rooms, you will be haunted by new voices and you will be the one deciding… who dies. WHAT IS SO UNIQUE ABOUT INNER VOICES? Non-linear storyline full of plot twists and choices, that may lead you to 5 different endings . Intriguing, disquieting gameplay due to the ever-changing randomized maze . Unique, dark atmosphere inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft, E. A. Poe and S. King. A climatic experience thanks to the moody soundtrack and audio design. Engaging puzzles with different levels of complexity.",
