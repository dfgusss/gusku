    "About the game": "***PAUSE THE EXPERIENCE TO CHANGE GRAPHICS SETTINGS AND REDUCE GRAIN*** EPISODE ONE: THE CHAMPION Half music video. Half blurry nightmare. The first episode of Kingdom City Drowning is an experiment in soaking in atmosphere and just 'being there.' Where narrative takes a back seat to the aggressive soundtrack, brutal visuals and oppressive tone. Follow James' escape from the confines of a deep underground prison mining complex to meet up with his only two kin, but an escape is not without cost. In order to attain freedom, James must first strike a deal with the devil. KINGDOM CITY - the last standing mega-metropolis in a world choked by a toxic haze, forcing man to endlessly create towering structures that reach into the heavens, grasping for pure air. KINGDOM CITY DROWNING begins in the deepest, most depraved depths of Kingdom City, nearest the haze and desperation. Embody the camera as you follow three delinquents - James, Maika, and Brooks - bound by violence, trauma, love, and the desire to forge their way to the top by any means necessary. CREATED BY: William Gerardi and Barrett Phillips STARRING: Kentucker Audley, Sofia Banzhaf and Amin Joseph",
