    "About the game": "Race against the clock in time trials, beat that ultimate high score in freestyle or go BIG with massive jumps in freeride mode. From wakestyle to oldschool to kiteloops to wave riding - in Kiteboarding Pro the sky isn't the limit. ABOUT THIS GAME Kiteboarding Pro is a semi-realistic kitesurfing game with procedural animations that allow for a variety of tricks - from simple grabs and board-offs to complex unhooked maneuvers. Wind and weather The wind range can be changed in the game. The lightest breeze corresponds to approximately 8 knots, and the strongest wind reach up to 50 knots. The size of the kite changes according to the wind's strength. Furthermore, small kites are a lot more hectic than big ones. Maps Explore your environment in one of the three main maps with different themes: Caribbean-style, lake and an icy world. To bring more variety to the visual appeal of the maps, you can kite from morning until sundown with clear sky or overcast weather. Competition For the more competitive players there are two main modes: Freestyle and Time trials. In either of those modes you can beat the high score and compare yourself to the world's best ranking players. After completing certain goals you will be rewarded with bonus kites and boards. Due to the nature of kiteboarding you will need to master not only the board controls but also the kite, too. In the beginning, for new players, it can be tricky to control the kite and navigate the board at the same time. Just like in real life, the sport is hard to pick up but once you get going, you will be hooked immediately!",
