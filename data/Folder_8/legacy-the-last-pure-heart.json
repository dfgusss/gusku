    "About the game": "People have been at war throughout their history. And every time they start a war, they forget about the consequences of the previous war. People do not notice this, but the animals whose houses were destroyed by people during the war suffer the most. You will learn how animals lived before humanity interrupted their tranquility. Immerse yourself in the animal kingdom. You have to both become a predator and hunt others, and become a victim to escape from predators. Sleep outdoors, enjoying the starry skies, or in a safe burrow away from danger. Become a bird and soar above the clouds. Or by becoming a bear, take care of your cub. Enjoy the beautiful world before the start of the war and find out what the consequences of the war will be. And execute a righteous judgment on the world, knowing all the circumstances.",
