    "About the game": "Molecule Make Lab is a puzzle game about chemistry, you need to place the atoms in the right places by rotating the hexagons clockwise and counterclockwise until the molecule is formed. Minimalist and elegant There are 100 puzzle levels carefully chosen. Knowledge in chemical is not required *** THIS GAME IT'S NOT AN APPRENTICESHIP WAY *** To molecule representation we chose the model 'Simplified structural form' , in this format the hydrogen can be hidden or grouping in H2 or H3, not being necessary to inform that a connection with a single hydrogen occurs. We selected molecules to be represented in Hexagon form and because of this shape some molecules were adapted to game mechanisms, making it difficult to read the simplified structural form. MiniMap Used the map to navigate between the puzzles Puzzle Organized the atoms in the correct position Challenge Find molecules with huge atom quantity and complex structure",
