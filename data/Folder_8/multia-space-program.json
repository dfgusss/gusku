    "Release date": "Sep 1, 2021",
    "About the game": "The game world is based in a small town in Finland called Multia but for game design reasons it's not 100% accurate. This is a really simple game but it makes up for it with at least a kind of interesting story. Explore the world and find parts for your rocket and launch it into space! The game gives you instructions for what part you should find next but you have to figure out what part you can use. The game has a hidden story that isn't told to you directly but which you can figure out by exploring the world and finding details. In the beginning, there's a soundtrack that starts the story but I'll add a cutscene video that goes along with the soundtrack at some point too. 3 different rockets 3 different endings Most of the endings have comedic aspects and there are some throughout the game. This game is complete but will receive some small updates like new rockets, new parts, new endings, and of course bug fixes, maybe additions to the story. Multia Space Program is one of the side projects that I'll release during the development of my early access game Project Ultra, I'll make small games like this while I'm figuring out what I'll do next for Project Ultra.",
