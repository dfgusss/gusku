    "About the game": "From composer Edwin Montgomery comes a new musical work for the COVID-19 era. In Neon Cyborg Cat Club, life as we know it no longer exists - but left in our wake are robotic cats, originally manufactured for companionship by a doomed humankind, now roaming an apocalyptic cityscape. ​Enter a vivid 3D digital environment and transport yourself from the comfort of your own home to this dystopian feline future. There, you can visit one of the last areas populated by the cyborg cats, for an immersive and voyeuristic experience as the curious and wistful creatures create unique musical soundscapes with their individual movements. Audiences can choose which cats to spend time with, from a number of viewpoints, and enjoy private performances that are unique every time. Choose from 4 different music modes, each with their own mood, time of day, and weather Choose up to 6 cats to create the performance for you (and discover their backstories) View the room from multiple camera angles, or follow a cat as it wanders Listen to the soundtrack be performed in real time - never the same way twice A new music work for people who like cats, sci-fi, and listening to rain... Supported by the City of Melbourne COVID-19 Arts Grants. --- 'Late in the 21st Century, shortly after mankind eradicated all natural animal and plant life on earth, they succeeded in destroying their own species - homo sapiens . As the last humans die of starvation in the world's great cities, the mechanical cats they built for comfort continue to roam in the towers of glass and steel high above, in rooms called CAT SANCTUARIES. One by one, over many years, the batteries in the cats shut down. One of the last remaining active rooms was known as the NEON CYBORG CAT CLUB.'",
