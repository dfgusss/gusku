    "About the game": "A wonderful review from Handheld Gaming Community: -terra/ NEW TERRA is a multi-directional gravity based space shooter and more specifically, it's a physics strategy game set in outer space, on asteroids, under alien oceans, within mineshafts on distant planets and so on. You control the ships rotation and forward/reverse thrust, with every thrust use costing you fuel. The ship is constantly pulled downward by gravity, which you can use to your advantage if you strategize properly, or it will work against you. Each level has limited fuel and limited power ups, so if you make inefficient decisions, you will often run out of fuel and crash (and die). You have weapons but you have to sometimes strategize the use of them, especially around rock, as it will cause rock to fall and land on you or enemies. You can't touch anything with your ship or you quickly take damage. Obviously, if you take too much damage you will crash (and die). Some missions require you to tow heavy objects which makes your fuel burn twice as fast for a quarter of the speed of travel, so physics and decision making come very much into play. There are 18 unique missions all set on different planets, asteroids or interstellar locations and there is also a 'pitch black mode' where it turns the lights out on every single level so you have only your headlamp to rely on for visibility, this ultimately brings 36 unique experiences to you as a player. It's an extremely challenging but fun game. As a player, you start out with 30 lives. Hidden in each level is an extra life you can claim once. Keyboard Now Supported! As requested by a reviewer -- We have added keyboard support. Note: The game does not have a keyboard layout shown in game because the keyboard needs to be localized into 20 languages. ESC = menu/back/cancel Q = activate watts = thrust A = left S = reverse D = right Z = Select ability on the left X = choose the right ability E = throw object R = headlight Enter = Accept",
