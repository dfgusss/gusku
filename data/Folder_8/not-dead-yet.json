    "About the game": "Not Deat Yet is a 1-4 player co-op, fast-paced, rogue-lite FPS, with elements of deck-building and strategy that will test your skills in creating your own build while having to manage your resources and survive restless waves of zombies. After some yet unknown global events, Earth has become hostile and packed with not-so-dead 'people' - and you're amongst the survivors who try to escape to a better place. Is there a better place? Fast-paced, non-stop zombie carnage. One of our goals is that you won't ever have a second to yawn. Enemies are always lurking around and bring different challenges. RPG Elements. Crafting, scrapping, repairing, perks, and a little dose of RNG - yep, all included! Every match is unique. New experiences at each new game. Designed with deck-building gameplay in mind, you'll be able to experiment with different roles, perks, and weapons - all that resulting in surprisingly fun and distinct playstyles. Every enemy is unique. If you want to succeed, only a weapon is not enough - you gotta learn and master your foes because each and every enemy is distinct from the other. Lots of weapons. Pistols, shotguns, rifles, SMGs - play with your favorite weapon type! Difficult yet rewarding gameplay. Every time you succeed, you really feel like so. 4 players Online Cooperative. Want to play with friends? We've got you covered. Steam Achievements. Who doesn't like a good achievement, right? We have plenty - and are always adding more. Not Dead Yet is in early development. Meaning placeholder content, occasional bugs, not-perfect performance, unbalanced gameplay. Just buy it if you don't mind having to deal with these things. Also, you're welcome and encouraged on helping us shaping the future of the game!",
