The ever oppressing Faction wants everyone to follow and obey. They will stop at nothing. People are scared. Demoralized. The few who fight back are painfully outnumbered. They need hope. Someone to show them the way. Will you stand up for humanity and fight for its future? Get inside this VR Shooter to lead the Resistance to victory over the evil Faction forces and their brutal killing machines. &gt; WEAPONS, UPGRADES, AND IMPROVEMENTS Arm yourself with a massive arsenal of fully-customizable guns, ranging from classic shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles and machine guns to super-powered futuristic firearms. Feel the experience of changing scopes at every situation, for close combat, mid range, or sniping &gt; 4 AREAS TO EXPLORE &amp; 22 LEVELS TO FIGHT THE FACTION Fight against the Faction through a huge territory under their control. Get into its alleys, slums and industry districts until you arrive at the core, where their headquarters are. Shoot your way out using cover like cars, houses, and destroyed machinery. Every area where you can avoid being shot is a good place to face the Faction with all your arsenal. &gt; CHOOSE YOUR OWN WAY You won’t be standing still at any point during the game, just waiting until your enemies come to you. Every time you move forward, you will select which path you want to play. It’s easy, choose the red one to increase the difficulty. Want to play the next levels as a professional sniper? Choose long distance weapons. Want to be a badass in the frontline? Take flashbang, air strikes and a big shotgun. &gt; EPIC BOSS BATTLES &amp; ENEMIES GROWING UP You will increase your power, as you get a better arsenal, but the faction won’t just watch you in silence. The deeper you go into their territory, the bigger the robots will be that confront you, with more powerful weapons that hit really hard.
