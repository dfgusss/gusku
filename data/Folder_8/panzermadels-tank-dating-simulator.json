But when he arrives, Erwin realizes it's not Tank School, but 'Tank School' for World War II Tanks. Who happen to look just like Japanese School Girls...! Instead of studying military history and doctrine, he's in 'Basic Artillery Computations for Fire Support 101', and 'Radio Operations 214'. Will he win the heart of the tank-girls, or end up as cannon fodder? Only you can decide in, 'Panzermadels: Tank Dating Simulator'. DETAILS Panzermadels is made by 'DEVGRU-P' a small team of American developers in the style of a traditional Japanese Visual Novel.

See the World Darkest Depths of Your Frail Existence. Meet Fun and Interesting People Tanks. Date Them. Also There's a Beach Episode.",
