RawTools Pixeluvo contains a full high precision raw image processing pipeline. Import raw files from all camera manufacturers Have precise control over exposure, color, and tone values Raw files are placed in their own layer type (indicated by a letter ‘R’ in the layer preview), and all settings remain fully editable. Add other layers to your project, use adjustment layers and masks, and all the while keep coming back to fine tune the settings for raw conversion. When you are totally happy with the settings you can convert the layer to an ordinary bitmap layer in order to paint directly onto it, or apply destructive filters to it.

With the various selection tools you can quickly isolate regions for further editing.
