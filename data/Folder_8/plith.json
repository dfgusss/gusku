    "About the game": "Plith is an indie puzzle game for Windows and OS X. It puts gamers in a spatial setting, where they have to manage several puzzle elements (mostly gears) and must make quick decisions which can simplify or complicate their path to victory. Plith is a fast paced game which contains a lot of levels – more than 100 – to be solved. The player moves some gears and can place them on the level; some gears rotate, and transmit their rotation to the adjacent ones: the objective of each level is to activate the target gears. These levels constitute five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections. Each section introduces new gameplay elements; for example, several kinds of gears and obstacles come out along the game. The game is presented using mostly 3D graphics, with a few handmade drawings as well. Key Features: Five different worlds, which are subdivided into fourteen sections More than 100 levels Fast paced Several gameplay elements (e.g. several kinds of gears and obstacles)",
