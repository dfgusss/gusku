Hitting the beats will have the spectators joining the parade, missing the beats will cause them to leave. Keep the parade going until the end before taking on those that question LGBTQ+ rights in an epic dance battles and conquer hate with love! Play Hard The “Play Hard” game mode adds a unique RTS twist to the game, delivering all the entertaining over the top gameplay from the ‘Vanilla’ mode but with a unique tactical element. Customise your parade, pick your leaders from the various groups and use their abilities to amplify your message of love and inclusivity or shield the parade from those who want to rain on your parade. Move the groups around in real time to ensure your abilities and leaders are where you need them. Both game modes can be played as single player or local co-op, as well as featuring 3 difficulty modes (Virgin, Vicious &amp; Queen). You will find unique events and characters that reflects every city of the parade. Pride Run features: Rhythm Action based gameplay - encourage the audience to join in with the parade as you hit every beat.
