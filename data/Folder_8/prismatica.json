    "About the game": "Prismatica is a puzzle game with a brand new twist , inspired by Rubik’s Cubes, Sudoku, Dodecahedrons and way, way too much caffeine. The goal is to unscramble a series of puzzle boards by rotating multicolored pieces to match a logical pattern. It’s easy to learn and simple to play but surprisingly deep and difficult to master at later levels, presenting even the most veteran of puzzle enthusiasts with brain-tickling challenge. Prismatica's aesthetic design and feel is intended to be calm and essentialist, presenting the player with a pure puzzle to focus on solving in a flowing natural way. A hauntingly beautiful soundtrack from award winning indie folk musician Svavar Knutur reinforces the stoic atmosphere of contemplation and mental challenge presented by the deceptively simple looking puzzles. Features Brand new &amp; innovative puzzle type Old-school rotational chromatic combination mechanism Clean essentialistic style and design aesthetics Breathtakingly beautiful music by award winning indie folk musician Svavar Knutur Simple gameplay that's easy to learn Challenging puzzles that can be difficult to master Intuitive and straightforward controls Calmly tackle 48 lovingly hand crafted puzzles in your own time or test your wit and speed in the new Challenge Mode Now includes color blind mode for added accessibility",
