    "About the game": "Dive into the strange world of quantum mechanics in the game of Quantum Chess, the game you saw in Caltech IQIM's 'Anyone Can Quantum' where Paul Rudd beat Stephen Hawking. With the addition of the Quantum Move players can position a single piece in multiple locations on the board at once! This puts a whole new spin on standard chess strategy, and allows everyone to get hands on with quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement. Play against the computer, or pit your new found mastery against your friends in an Online match.",
