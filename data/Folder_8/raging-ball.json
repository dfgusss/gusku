    "About the game": "RAGING BALL You're a ball and all you have to do is to finish the run. The controls are easy but the levels can seem difficult. Sometimes... Well, sometimes you gonna rage. There are 30 levels dispatch on 3 chapters. ADVICES All level can be finished ; You can train with the training mode (in the chapters selections) ; If you loose to much, take a good breath ; Some level are still difficult to me ; Every 'S' notes had already been acheived by myself (so it's possible!) ; Send me your best score. NOTES During the game, you gonna have some notes : Levels notes depend on the time spent ; Chapters notes depend on the levels notes (not on the time spent). HISTORY This is my first game. I learned code and Unity with RagingBall. If you like this I will make other runs... But to be fair, you gonna hate this game.",
