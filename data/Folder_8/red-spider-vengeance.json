    "Release date": "Nov 25, 2016",
    "About the game": "We're an indie game developer studio from Japan. We're big fans of Hong Kong films and want to present the fascination of them. Red Spider: Vengeance is a Hong Kong noir style visual novel inspired by many hong kong movies, especially Infernal Affairs series and Johnnie To's films. There are 6 story routes with the different characters(approximately 105,000 words in total). Synopysis Yvet grew up as an orphan on the Mainland. She was taken in by a crime syndicate when she was young and trained as an assassin. She killed many people, but she had her reasons for breaking out of that group. She escaped and married Francis, the leader of the Red Flower Society, an underworld mob that operated in Kowloon, Hong Kong. One day, Francis was shot in a nightclub, and a doctor said that it was highly unlikely he would regain consciousness. Yvet takes over his responsibilities and tries to find the person who was behind the shooting, with her bodyguards and a private detective she knew.",
