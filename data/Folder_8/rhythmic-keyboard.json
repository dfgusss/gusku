    "About the game": "Rhythmic Keyboard is a music-based typing game with integration of a talent system that allows for the player to increase their overall effectiveness. Early Access For the Early Access release, Rhythmic Keyboard offers 20 songs and one level to progress through as well as numerous talents to assist the player on their way to achieving mastery. Progression is score-based, so players will need to increase their scores to unlock new songs. Each song has three modes of difficulty: easy, medium, and hard, that should provide players of all skill levels with a challenge and the ability to earn points for the purchase of talents; more points are awarded as the difficulty increases. Forget about memorization: Rhythmic Keyboard uses procedurally generated key letters/timing, so each experience is unique, making the player rely more on reaction speed as well as hand/eye coordination. If the included songs become unappealing/repetitive, but you would like to continue typing using most (no points earned during custom song gameplay) of Rhythmic Keyboard's features, then you can select music ( MP3 , WAV , and OGG Vorbis supported) from your personal collection, to be used during gameplay.",
