    "About the game": "Rift is a third person arcade-style shooter with elements of stealth, melee combat and tactical gameplay driven by a cinematic story bursting with twists and turns. In RiFT, you must protect Max, a child with special abilities, and figure out ways to escape from Axion; a heavily guarded science research facility. However, Max becomes weaker whenever he uses his psychokinetic ability as a weapon. And in order to use Max’s ability, the player must have amassed a certain number of kill points. Your primary objective is to escape from the research facility unscathed with Max, so you’ll have to use his abilities only when necessary. The gameplay takes inspiration from the classic “capture the flag” mode but steps it up with intense and thrilling arcade action. Think of the anime AKIRA meets action movie THE RAID. Your mission is - do whatever it takes to keep Max alive in each reality in order to bring balance to the universe. If you fail - Max dies. If Max dies, the universe will shatter into chaos.",
