    "About the game": "The human race explores the stars, but a keen focus on the future has left a trail of desolation in the past. You are Alex Pieterson, commander of the salvage ship Thaddeus and its team of hardened agents. You are a remnant of that past, fighting for survival in a huge new galaxy. Salvaged is a strategy game designed to be played in both virtual reality and with regular 2D screens. The game’s first-person command view is a unique take on the genre, allowing the player to see the world of Salvaged literally through the eyes of Commander Pieterson. Story-focused campaign - Salvaged features an original story-focused campaign mode penned by Daniel Hunter-Dowsing, a twisting narrative that integrates seamlessly with the game’s crew and combat systems. Command your agents - Take command with unique real-time combat mechanics that force you to think on your feet. Plus, view the action through each of your agent’s head-cams in classic Hollywood style. Upgrade and customise - Your team of Salvagers will become a personal squad of expert alien hunters. Make them your own with customisable skills, weapons and armour. Adapt your team to fit your strategy. A deep new universe to explore - Salvaged takes place in a universe torn apart by warfare, pestilence and greed. The human race explores the stars, but a keen focus on the future has left a trail of desolation in the past. Designed for both VR and regular play - Salvaged has been developed with virtual reality at the fore, designed to immerse you in your role as the commander of the salvage ship Thaddeus. However, the game can also be enjoyed without a VR headset, allowing anyone to experience the tactical gameplay and story-driven campaign.",
