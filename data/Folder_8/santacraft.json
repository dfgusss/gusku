    "About the game": "A massive blizzard has struck the North Pole and wiped out Santa's Village. His reindeer and sleigh are being held by the Abdominal (not a typo!) Snowman. Dig your way through snow, cut down gingerbread trees, and mine candy canes as you try to rescue your missing reindeer, rebuild Santa's Village, and save Christmas! MINING AND CRAFTING Dig your way through snow, cut down trees with your gingerbread axe, and mine chocolate rocks with your candy cane hammer. Go fishing for saltwater taffy. Use the resources you find to craft items and buildings to decorate Santa's Village! BUILD SANTA'S VILLAGE Rebuild Santa's Village with gingerbread houses, toy stores, Christmas trees, balloons, and more! COMPLETE QUESTS Complete quests to rescue Santa's reindeer from the Abominable, Abdominal, and Adorable Snowmen (among others). Collect birds, teach puffins to sing, bake cookies, race the tortoise, play the bagpipes, and so much more! TRAINS Build train stations and tracks to connect different parts of your island. Hop on a train and ride the rails! LOTS OF PUNS We don't have a gif to go with this one, we just really like puns! We made this game to celebrate the joy and silliness of the Christmas stories we love. So grab a mug of hot cocoa, relax, and join us for a little taste of Christmas. We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it! Owen &amp; Matt (aka Milkbag Games) Wishlist our next game, Potion Pipeline! /",
