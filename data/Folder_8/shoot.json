    "About the game": "What is 'Shoot!'? Have you ever thought about being a superhero? We have! And that's why we created 'Shoot!'. In this game, you have to destroy the targets that appear in front of you. But it's not that simple. You can only kill bad guys, but the good ones like to appear in front of them, so you have to be careful, but quick. Gadgets When you complete each level, you will receive a device (shield watches, night vision helmet, etc.), that will be useful in the next level. Special bullets In the shop, you can buy special bullets. These bullets can help you defeat your enemies and gain more points. Level differences In some levels, not only you shoot against the bad guys, but the bad guys can shoot back at you, so you have to be careful. What to expect? You will use your gadgets, special bullets, and most importantly your brain. You can challenge your friends and find out who is the best superhero. Conclusion Yeah, I know you don't want to read anymore, you want to fly into space with a jetpack, shoot aliens and rescue astronauts, or go rescue the police in a dark city. Don't wait and try it now! Planned features Multiplayer (COOP, VS, Duels) More guns and gun modification More levels (Chapter 2 - Space) More gadgets Every month we will ask our followers on IG, what they want to be added next. So make sure you are following us.",
