    "About the game": "The world of stickman was devoured by the darkness, our pitiful stickman losed himself in the night. There is only one way to save this world---collecting seven colorful balls to call the rainbow in the dark world. The stickman is small , weak and helpless, but he is good at running! This game will take you about 1 hour, of course you can use less time if you were a super player! In this game you need to control a stickman to collect seven light balls, they are distributed on the top of the giant tree, the floating island, or , in the sky. Please be careful, stickman would not dead by falling down, but that will give you a bad experience, you will face to the obstacle one more time. Press A and D to move, hold A or D will accelerate your speed but be careful of falling. Press W to jump, the longer you hold, the higher you jump. Press S to stop. Press Q or E to change the direction of stickman(or some cool action lick somersault) Press R to back to the checkpoint. In this game, we will save your position in the thunder, that is your checkpoint, you can take a time jumping and back to the last checkpoint by press R. It's quit important, remember that. Press the right mouse button to slow down the time speed. PS: In fact this game is more like a parkour, you control the stickman to go though the dangerous treetop and floating stone. Stickman is small but powerful, you can jump on the vertical wall or shuttle jumping like a shinobi, you can konw more by watching our video. Try to use these action and pay attention to all things you see-for example, the upward branch in the first stage- the game will be esay for you. ************************************** 19/4/22 Press the right mouse button to slow down the time speed.",
