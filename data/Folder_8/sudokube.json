    "About the game": "SudoKube is the first Sudoku game set on 3D cubes. Each level is formed by 6 sudoku puzzles that share the solution in the cube edges. Something unique and unprecedented! All sudoku rules are applied and the whole cube also has only one solution, so it's really intuitive for a regular sudoku player; Practice every day and keep your brain sharp; Infinite 2x2 puzzles if you just want to warm up your brain before work; Infinite easy 3x3 puzzles if you want to challenge yourself before your next meeting; Infinite hard 3x3 puzzles if you are a experienced Sudoku player and have enough time available; A single souls-like 4x4 puzzle if you feel fearless and think that nothing can harm your brain! Do not try to start this level if you are not willing to spend hours facing a single puzzle. Risk of brain melting and severe damage to your self-esteem. You declare that you take full responsibility for your choice. Note: Generating this 4x4 puzzle is quite expensive for us. If 100 people complete this puzzle, they will enter a permanent in-game hall of fame, and we pledge to update the game with 5 more 4x4 puzzles when that happens.",
