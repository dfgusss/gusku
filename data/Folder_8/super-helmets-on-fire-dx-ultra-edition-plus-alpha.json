    "About the game": "A simple construction worker with a simple objective… save the world. Sounds quite simple, huh? This might be a little difficult to achieve though. Super Helmets on Fire DX is a crazy side scrolling action platformer game, with lots of nods to old school games, mixed with hardcore runner gameplay and a pinch of RPG lite elements. You take control of The Worker, a simple guy that works at a building site in a bustling megalopolis. But one day, while mining some rocks, he discovered a secret that would have better been hidden forever! The Ancient Evil God, a huge sphinx with the power to destroy the world, wakes up from his eternal slumber and sends our hero into an adventure through time and space, where he will try to save all his companion workers and the world! Key features: Classic side scrolling running gameplay. High difficulty using fast reflex based gameplay. You will need to conquer the jump and crouch buttons if you want to survive. Story mode with escalating difficulty and bosses. 5 worlds to visit, including The City, Egypt, The Future... Procedurally generated levels that will learn from your gameplay behaviour. RPG-lite stat based challenge mode where you can modify your favourite character. Various skills that will help you during runs to get better records. More than 10 characters to unlock and play with, parodying popular characters! Endless running Classic mode, with no character abilities. Only your skills and proficiency will help you in this mode. Awesome chiptune soundtrack created by Carlos Viola. STEAM online leaderboards and achievements. Show your friends who is the best! Trading cards and badges. For Windows, Mac and Linux. Supports controller and keyboard. Although we recommend using a controller.",
