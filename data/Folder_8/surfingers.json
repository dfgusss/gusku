After a spectacular success of the Timberman game (over 30 million downloads worldwide) , Digital Melody Games' new arcade game is ready. It's all about surfing this time. Surfingers is a arcade game with controls based on up-and-down movement. The player must change the height of the wave in a dizzying pace, bypassing many obstacles (ships, balloons, rocks, trees, bones, pyramids etc) and try to get as long as possible without touching anything. The game offers surfing through various worlds, including: ocean, snow, desert or hell. There are over 20 characters available to choose from, which can eventually be unlocked for the achievements or gained stars. 'The graphic design of the game was inspired by 1970s California, colorful posters and the Surf Rock music genre. In addition, we used a variety of colors to make the game more enjoyable' 'That was close, we would never have released Surfingers. You need to prepare many prototypes of the game to find the perfect gameplay. I remember that we have reached the milestone in that single moment we introduced the diagonal waves and changing worlds. Thanks to these changes the game got incredible playability.” Game features: Over 20 characters to unlock Surfing music and graphic Worlds full of dangers Innovative gameplay GABEN surfing at 100 bill! What could be more cool then that!!! Come on!!!",
