    "About the game": "Sweet Tooth 2 - is a physical puzzle game with a side view. In the second part, there are more new items to pass, the game has become more difficult! The player needs to help the green jelly-like creature, pass the levels and collect candy using physical laws. The character can take 2 forms square and circle, this is actively used in solving puzzles. The game has 30 levels that become more complex as you progress, adding new items to pass, complicating and diversifying the gameplay. I bet only 25% of people will pass all the levels and only 1% will collect all 3 candies in each level. So if you are looking for challenging puzzles, then welcome!",
