    "About the game": "Tengutana is a virtual reality puzzle game. The player needs to have a sharp eye and good aim as he will have to swing with katana and throw shurikens to solve the tasks at hand. Your training will be assisted by a supernatural being that will guide you through the whole process. The goal of the game is to gather souls of fallen warriors by solving puzzles.  Puzzles are made up by cuttable and non-cuttable objects, moving platforms, explosive barrels, portals and more. The game contains 50 levels to beat, bonus rounds and boss fights. In following months, free DLC is planned with additional levels to beat.",
