The game features a wide range of fantasy settings, ranging from forests to ruined cities and castles, the underworld and a demon's palace, even the realm of the celestials, as you pursue your quest. The game also features a diverse cast that includes monsters, humans, celestials, and demons. You will fight human cultists and monsters, make deals with demon lords and angels, and along the way learn more about your past and earn a chance to redeem yourself. The game also features a 2D, turn-based combat, puzzles, different endings, and sexual content with multiple women. Note: the game is sexually explicit with full scale nudity, so player discretion is advised.",
