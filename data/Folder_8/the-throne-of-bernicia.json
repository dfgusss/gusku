    "About the game": "Trouble is brewing in the kingdom of Bernicia, a peaceful realm ruled over by the newly-ascended Queen Amelia. Answer her call for heroes and help beat back the forces of evil that threaten the land in this fantasy RPG, inspired by the classics of the genre. Featuring More than a half-dozen different dungeons to explore! A band of stalwart companions for your adventuring party, each with their own backstory and quest to complete! A turn-based combat system with hundreds of enemies, skills, weapons, armor, and other features! A sprawling fantasy kingdom full of people to meet, from the lowly villagers of Port Polliver up to Queen Amelia herself! The incorrigible General Valda, fools! About the Author/Game This game's been my quarantine side-project since about June of 2020, where I decided to roll up my sleeves and actually finish a game idea of reasonable size and scope. The Throne of Bernicia is a fond homage to the RPGs of my youth, pretty much played straight and without any big twist on the formula. It was a whole lot of fun to work on, and hopefully you'll have fun playing it too! Credits &amp; Attribution This game was made using Kadokawa/Enterbrain's RPG Maker MV, mostly with the stock assets that came with the program. Additional assets and code came from hiddenone, Avery, Jack Saintsworth, Verdibona, Palxan, Victor Moura, and Yanfly, all of whom (to the best of my knowledge) released these assets for use in non-commercial works like this. All rights to these materials belong to their respective owners. If I have made any error in my attribution or any asset made its way into the final game whose owner was not credited here, please contact me ASAP so that I might make a correction. Special thanks to Dominique Corbett for the title art, logo, and extensive game testing!",
