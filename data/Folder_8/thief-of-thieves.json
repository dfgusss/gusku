    "About the game": "In Thief of Thieves , you play as a cat burglar using stealth, social engineering and team members to pull off some high profile heists across the world. Based on the award winning comic book series by Robert Kirkman, Thief of Thieves is a story of heists and the people behind them. It’s time for Celia, protege of master thief Redmond, to make the leap from apprentice to master. A botched job takes Celia to Europe, where she joins a new team of criminals for a crime spree. Get to know your team, choose your approach on the field, but be careful – the choices you make may have drastic consequences. A new continent and a new team - will you make the cut? Key Features The story is told via comic frames and gameplay, where Celia makes her way through scenes ranging from cocktail parties to construction yards by using her skills in social engineering and sneaking - never violence. Stunning Visuals – Unique visual style combining hand-drawn 2D comics and 3D environments into one seamlessly flowing story experience. Living, breathing characters brought to life by such voice actors like Fryda Wolff ( Mass Effect: Andromeda ), Stephen Stanton ( Rogue One ), Emily O’Brien ( Death Stranding ), Cissy Jones ( Firewatch, The Walking Dead: Season One ), Fred Tatasciore ( Kung Fu Panda 2 ), and Elias Toufexis ( Deus Ex: Human Revolution ) A tailor-made story – the choices you make shape the narrative and build the relationships with your team members. Thief of Thieves is based on the comic book series created by Robert Kirkman and published by Skybound Entertainment .",
