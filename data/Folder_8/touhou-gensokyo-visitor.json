    "About the game": "■About■ This is a short kinetic novel, about 2-4 hours long (depending on your reading speed). We tried to preserve the spirit of the Touhou universe. You will find a light humorous story about an ordinary guy whose life drastically changed one nice day when he accidentally got into Gensokyo. We have always wondered what a normal person would do if he found himself in such a situation. All characters in the game are animated. We tried to make it as lively as possible in order to convey their personality. ■Story■ Welcome to Gensokyo, a land of fantasy and strange creatures. All things, that are impossible, incredible, or unnecessary for our world, sooner or later will end up in Gensokyo. Amazing creatures live here: gods and demons, fairies and wizards, ghosts and yokai. The protagonist never dreamed of something incredible. He just lived just a normal life, went to work, until at some point he was in a strange forest. And he was very lucky that he met a girl dressed as a Shinto shrine maiden... The protagonist will spend an unforgettable day here and take part in a very important event of one of the heroines. ■Characters■ The protagonist will meet some interesting people as he travels around Gensokyo: Reimu is a shrine maiden of the Hakurei Shrine. Marisa is a sorceress with terrifying destructive magic. Cirno is an incredibly self-confident ice fairy. Sakuya is the chief maid of the Scarlet Devil Mansion and a servant of Remilia Scarlet. Yukari, a cunning youkai, one of the creators of Gensokyo. Tenshi is a bored celestial, always ready for fun. Also in one episode you can meet Remilia Scarlet, a powerful ancient vampire. We hope you enjoy our interpretation of these characters. ■ Game Information ■ ．Franchise: Touhou 東方 ．Language and Ratings: Japanese, English, Russian, Chinese ．Game Length: 2 to 4 hours ．All characters are animated. ■Other■ Touhou Project Creator: ZUN (Team Shanghai Alice) Developer: 69Gate This game follows guidelines with Touhou Project Steam publication regulations.",
