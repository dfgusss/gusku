    "About the game": "Trigon: Space Story is a roguelike single-player game that focuses heavily on strategy. Dive into a gripping story campaign that sees you commanding your own spaceship and deciding what sort of captain you want to be: a ruthless barbarian, an adventurous fortune hunter, or the hero the galaxy so desperately needs. In Trigon: Space Story, you’ll have a devastating arsenal of up to 100 different weapons at your disposal—including lasers, turrets, plasma cannons, space bombs and combat drones. You can pause the game at any time so you don’t lose sight of things in the heat of battle. But it’s on you to make the right tactical decisions and capitalize on your crew’s skills—because death is permanent! Only by experimenting with various strategies will you be able to master the challenging combat situations you must face as captain. Choose from a large selection of spaceships: Will you start your journey in a classic human spaceship, an energy-efficient Etari model, a bio-mechanical Rakkhi vessel or a high-tech Taertikon craft? As captain, you’re responsible for upgrading the weapons systems and board technology. You can use any resources you obtain to boost your ship’s weaponry. The crew remains the heart of your ship; skilfully deployed, they will give you the edge you need to win battles. Assign your crew important tasks and always keep their strengths and weaknesses in mind, so that everything runs like clockwork in your next encounter. Don’t hesitate over moral decisions—space doesn’t forgive mistakes! You’ll have the freedom to roam the galaxy on your conquest campaign: visit space stations, explore abandoned colonies and capture resources. Along the way, you’ll encounter four different races, each with their own characteristics, technologies and philosophies. Gain experience through quests, sudden events and tactical space battles and bring your newly acquired skills to bear against your enemies. The procedurally generated universe and dynamic events guarantee you a refreshingly different adventure every time. This, along with a sophisticated endless game mode, makes Trigon: Space Story highly replayable. Roguelike indie title with a sci-fi setting Action-packed tactical space battles Thrilling single-player story campaign High replayability with procedurally generated universe Endless decision-making possibilities",
