    "About the game": "Ultrawings is the first aerial-themed, open-world game where you'll pilot multiple aircraft to complete a variety of missions across an island-themed world. The game features full support for gamepad, HOTAS*, rudder pedals, and HTC Vive Wands, Oculus Touch, and Windows MR tracked motion controllers which allows you to use your hands to virtually interact with each aircraft's flight instruments for a truly unparalleled flight experience! The following HOTAS joysticks are officially supported: Saitek X52 Saitek X55 Saitek X56 Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog Thrustmaster HOTASX Thrustmaster HOTAS4 Thrustmaster T16000M If you don't have one of the officially supported joysticks your stick will not work with the game. Due to the way we detect HMDs and joysticks the game does not support virtual desktop. Key Features - Pilot 4 distinct aircraft using your virtual hands (or HOTAS and gamepad) for an unparalleled VR flight experience! - Soar around 4 unique, beautifully stylized islands! - Earn money to buy new airports (which unlock new mission types) and new aircraft! Ultrawings is a VR game with progression and gameplay! - Lots of gameplay variety! Pop balloons, snap photos, race, perform spot landings, fly through score rings, and more! This is a flight game reminiscent of the ones you remember on your favorite console(s) from the big N. - The world feels alive! Soar by flocks of seagulls, buzz other planes, and even fly by boats and cars! - Full English voice-overs guide you through the game! User Review Quotes: 'It's fun in a way no flight sim has been in a long time!' 'The flight model is a perfect combination of arcade and just enough realism to make it challenging.' 'Finally a sim that lets you hold the stick and operate the controls by hand.' 'It brings back memories of pilot wings 64.' Available for Arcades on SpringboardVR",
