    "About the game": "DESCRIPTION: Studios Sant Marc welcomes you to Watch Your Back, our first PC game for Steam. You are some small-time journalists, exploited by your boss. When an abandoned Cold War-era shelter is discovered, your boss sends you there to do the story of a lifetime. Only you two will know what awaits you in there... FEATURES: Explore! Discover the secrets of the shelter, investigate what happened inside there by finding refugee logs and find out how to get out of there alive! Survive! Survive in this labyrinthic shelter full of noises, obstacles and... monsters! Find a way to get around them before they hunt you down! Cooperate! You will have to decide who is exposed to the dangers of the shelter and who sacrifices himself and stays behind to watch the cameras and guide the other player to the exit. But beware, you will have to communicate with each other constantly, because only the watcher has the necessary information to escape from the shelter! Graphics! Unreal Engine 5's next-generation graphics and lighting engine brings Watch Your Back's shelter to life. All rooms are full of details.",
