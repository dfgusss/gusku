Make combinations of 3 or more balls of the same color, aim and shoot. Sometimes you will need to mentally select the desired angle so that the ball bounces off the edge of the screen and hits the place you intended. Also, in the Water Ball, you can change the color of the ball and there are several boosters that simplify the task. Good luck on your underwater adventure, get ready, aim and shoot the balls!",
