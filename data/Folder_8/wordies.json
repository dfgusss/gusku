    "About the game": "WORDIES The premise of wordies is simple, you're randomly assigned the task of guessing a commonly used American word. But with only 5 tries, Wordies is harder than it looks. Wordies also features a Daily Word &amp; a global highstreak leaderboard where you can compete with not only your friends but the rest of the world to be the best! When guessing you're given 3 different clues in the form of colors to help you along your way! Dark Gray - Indicates the letter you've chosen does not appear in the word. Orange - Indicates the letter you've entered is in the word, but appears in a different place. Green - Indicates the letter is in the correct place, but there is still the possibility of it appearing twice! Build up winstreaks, fustrate yourself, &amp; challenge friends all in an hour of wordies!",
