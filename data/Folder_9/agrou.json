Each game, a group of villagers gather around the fire and face a problem: werewolves hide and eat innocents among the players! Every day, they get together and have to debate who they think are guilty. The player gets sacrificed the next night. When the sun is down, the werewolves decide on their next victim. Among the villagers, some players have peculiar roles and powers: the seer, the thief, the hunter... Much needed help that has to be used wisely and strategically! If all of the werewolves are eliminated, the villagers win the game. On the opposite, the werewolves are victorious and the village gets torn appart.
