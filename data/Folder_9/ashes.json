    "Name": "Ashes",
    "Release date": "Oct 26, 2018",
    "About the game": "Ashes is first person adventure with a heavy focus on narrative and atmosphere. We mixed a few game genres to try to achieve something new. The game draws from walking simulators, first person medieval adventures and horror games. It's not exactly a horror game nor it is an adventure rpg, it is something in the middle to be enjoyed in one sitting, like a short interactive bed time story for casual players. You play as a man that wakes up with memory loss in a dungeon, as you progress through the dungeon you get your memories back unraveling the mystery behind your situation. With puzzles, first person combat, weapon management, platforming and story telling, we hope to give a new kind of adventure to the everyday gamer. Features Engaging story First person combat First person platforming Puzzles Destructible objects for stress relief",
