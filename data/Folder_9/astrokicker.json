Key Features: Story: Astrokicker features a full story, playing out without forcing the player to sit through cut scenes Modern mode: In modern mode, you fly in any direction, ships are rendered in 3D with a detailed UI Retro Mode: While in Retro mode, ships are limited to 8 directions and the graphics will bring back that hot 80s arcade action feel Visuals: Beautiful parallax scrolling backgrounds in modern mode - we created 100 unique backgrounds for mouthwatering visuals Powerups: The action can get intense, so selecting and using the various powerups can make the difference between victory and defeat Control: Astrokicker makes full use of your gamepad, with quick selection of your powerups at your figertips",
