Check out a view of the majestic Mt. Fuji on the way... Learn about the backstory of Kaze no Denwa “the Wind Phone” - a true story about loss and love We created Beyond Tokyo because: - We love travel. Traveling gives us new perspectives and lenses, and helps us gain understanding and empathy - something that is all the more important today. - We love Japan - who doesn’t?:) Not only the popular and the obvious - the food, the fashion, the energy, but also “beyond” that. We want to show you how locals live, transport you to off-the-beaten-path places that mean something to the people. And we want to reimagine the amazing stories about the very essence of the culture - such as the one about Hachiko, on loyalty, honor, and love, the Japanese way. - We love VR. We love watching 360 videos of places around the world and “going places”. And we want more - to freely explore a new place immersively, and also see in reality how people live, and what’s unique about the culture. With Beyond Tokyo, we’re excited to share all this with you, in virtual reality, so you could be as excited as we are in exploring Tokyo, and eventually travel there in real life as well. It is a family-friendly experience for all ages and for anyone interested in traveling to Japan or learning more about Japanese culture.",
