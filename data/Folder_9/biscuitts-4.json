    "About the game": "Biscuitts 4 is a Beat Em Up Game based on the 80s Cartoon. If you remembered watching the 80's cartoon series and had fond childhood memories of it, you’re going to appreciate this side-scrolling Beat Em Up game. You can love how the visuals or animations remain true to the old cartoon series, cheesy, but goooood, just the way its meant to be The Filmation cartoons, because of their constant use of animation, kind of looked like a videogame in many occasions. So we was thinking of how cool it would be to see a game with old cartoon graphics. The gameplay is clear and simple. You control a character where you can walk and use punches to combat with enemies over the levels. When you kill all enemies you go to the next level. Features and Content One Character to choose and play Levels with different themes and enemies",
