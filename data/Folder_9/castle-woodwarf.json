    "About the game": "JOIN US ON DISCORD CASTLE WOODWARF Castle Woodwarf is a fun strategy and base building game in which you must build a thriving dwarf community and gather resources, food and materials. You have a simple camp and you must collect lumber, food and gold so you can purchase new upgrades. Hire a Fisher dwarf who will automatically travel to water and fish for food, or hire a Lumberdwarf who will chop down trees for wood. You can also collect these materials and food with a gather dwarf. Food is the most important resource and all your workers constantly eat fish so you must provide a steady supply. Underneath your settlement in the caves below your dwarves guard a precious dragon egg. This egg helps defend your settlers from invading monsters and you must protect it at all costs. As you progress you can upgrade your workers and other aspects of your settlement to improve your resource collection etc. Try and manage your resources carefully and build a strong community!
