    "About the game": "Chico's Family-Friendy Circus is a Point &amp; Click with elements of horror and comedy. You take the position of Mank in his 2:00 - 4:00 A.M. shift and must manage to finish your job without consuming all the energy...Well, at least that's what's supposed to be. Main features: - Some different endings; - Short gameplay per shift (~12 minutes); - 4 different cameras to check and spy; - Lights on/off and sound on/off; - At least 3 clowns, I think. *Warning: This game contains scenes with sudden bright/distorted images and changes in volume. Content may not be suitable for all audiences.",
