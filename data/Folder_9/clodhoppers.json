    "About the game": "Clodhoppers is a 1-8 player online and local single/multiplayer brawler designed around quick games and big laughs, a cross between Worms and Smash Bros. The artwork is created using clay models and stop motion animation to give a unique aesthetic. It's led by the creator of Platypus, Anthony Flack and is the spiritual successor to Cletus Clay MELEE FISTICUFFS Clodhoppers love a bit of hand to hand, axe to foot or crate to head combat. All the good stuff they used to do with Grandpa when they were kids - good clean fun. RANGED WEAPONRY When the pressure is on, it’s great to have a good old fire-in-a-general-direction shotgun by your side. If accuracy is your thing, don’t rely on old fashioned Clodhopper tech, grab an Alien blaster and aim between the eyes. ALIEN MENACE A new pestilence has plagued the Clodhoppers’ farm land. Aliens messing with crops ‘n’ cows just won’t do, send them home or to oblivion and let's get back to fighting each other. UP TO 8 PLAYERS Clodhoppers is a game about friends, drop kicking friends, and smashing a crate on their head. It never gets old, I tell you, the times I’ve been knocked off a cliff… Ah, warm memories. SHARPEN YOUR SKILLS Clodhoppers love to train in the little-known martial art of ‘dirty scrapping’. While your friends are nursing their pride, sharpen your dropkicks and uppercuts in the score attack modes. Game Features: Online/Local Multiplayer brawling for up to 8 players Stop-motion animated clay characters Pickup'n'play controls Hicks (and soon... cows... and then... thieving alien scum) Multiple controller support",
