    "About the game": "Few have not heard the legend of the Knight of Torn. Using a magic sword containing a powerful angel, Sir Tomas Weryn the Torn defeated many evils during his lifetime. He led his life dedicated to protecting his kingdom from evil. But his day did come eventually. He fell during the Battle of Blackshield. He died fighting beside the great King Blackshield himself. Fighting against the Dark Remnant's undead army. After the battle, his body was returned to his home kingdom. It was laid to rest in a grand mausoleum with his powerful sword. But this was not to be the end of the story for his sword. Rumors have begun to be spread as of late. Sir Weryn's magic sword has been said to have returned from the grave. But it is no longer the righteous blade it once was. It is now said to be cursed with evil. Death eventually comes to anyone that attempts to use it. Several evil factions are seeking the blade. And unfortunately for you, this cursed sword seems to have fallen into your possession. Inspired by old-school rogue-like and RPGs, DarkDIRE uses simple graphics/animation to build a living world. Explore endless procedurally generated kingdoms and dungeons. Gain loot by raiding enemy kingdoms. Sell it to become rich and powerful. Maybe even powerful enough to rule your own kingdom.
