    "About the game": "This arcade shoot 'em up has no shooting and you can only turn right. Avoid waves of enemies and get points as they crash into each other. Pick up power-ups, such as a large laser or a force field to destroy the enemies. Die, get a score and repeat to get a higher score the next run. Avoid and outsmart enemies by figuring out their moving patterns and make them crash into walls or each other. The game is controlled with a single button because you move forward with no option to brake and you can only turn right. Pick up power-ups to make it easier to destroy enemies. Kill enough enemies with a power-up to trigger a combo and be rewarded with an additional power-up. Features ✅ Endless gameplay ✅ Infinite Ramping difficulty ✅ Power-ups (Missiles, Giant Laser, Shield) ✅ Enemies with unique moving patterns ✅ Steam achievements ✅ Steam leaderboards ✅ Keyboard, mouse or gamepad controls",
