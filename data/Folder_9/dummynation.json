    "About the game": "You are given unlimited power over a country, with a single promise to fulfill: world domination. How you manage to achieve it is up to you. Expand your territory by military occupation to gain more power, but do not spread too thin too fast or your empire will crumble even faster. Analyze and manipulate diplomatic relations to invade countries while avoiding creating too many powerful enemies. Use your country's resources to sustain your research and military campaigns, but if you spend too much your land will be impoverished and you will fall behind your rivals in the balance of power. Determine your country's economic policy and reach a high economic growth, which might allow you to outpace your rivals in the power race even without using military force. Annexations over time In Dummynation, resources are not tied to entire regions, but are inherent to each place, and when a conquest occurs, these places and their resources are progressively annexed over time. Meanwhile, resistance forces can automatically arise, holding off the conquest and wearing down the attacker. Replaying games Relive your favorite games and watch the rise of your empire, or learn from your defeats by studying how it all went wrong. Multiplayer* Compete online against up to a hundred** players in a battle royale for world domination, as each player works to defend their interests and gain points to climb the leaderboard. *Multiplayer games will depend on server status and may not always be available. **Number of players will depend on the flow of users joining the game at that time, in order to reduce waiting times as much as possible.",
