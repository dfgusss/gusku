    "About the game": "Take the role as a liquidator descending down the sewers and beyond to destroy an old abandoned nuclear core. The core is a relic from an old, failed experiment where the goal was to mutate creatures and use them as weapons. But... the mutants wouldn't be controlled and the government abandoned the project, sealing off every entrance. They deny any involvement. However, the mutants are still down there, gradually making their way up... Unless, you can destroy the core?! Dungeon Core is a challenging roguelite top-down shooter that has an 'all-hope-is-lost'-vibe, but is it? Features Permanent upgrades to help you on your journey A dozen of weapons that can be upgraded with stats Lots of items &amp; upgrades Unique dungeons each time you play Multiple themes Play with mouse/keyboard or a controller",
