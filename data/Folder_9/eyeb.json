    "About the game": "THE GAME Eyeb is a tower defense-like by indie dev Giant Gourami. The game goes beyond traditional action rogue-like games and focuses on exploration, foraging and building on the natural instinct to resource guard. As you explore the map you can build turrets to defend it and ultimately overwhelm the boss when it arrives. The game's development took place over four years until it's original theory matched the gameplay. THE SETTING Eyeb is set in a universe where super intelligent nano-bot clouds take the form of humanities worst nightmares. One young hero, Abe Hall, has uploaded his mind into his eyeball, and rammed his ship into the asteroid cluster that houses the evil Nano-Lord. A suicide mission to be sure, but it is the only way he can infiltrate, explore, steal nano-bot tech, and build like a nano-bot to face off the nemesis of mankind. THE FEATURES Procedurally generated levels 8 playable characers 11 bosses 11 usable spells (one for each boss) 11 turret types (one for each boss) Soooo many unique and game altering power ups A positive and negative stat power up system Destroyable levels Many unique and semi-generated enemies",
