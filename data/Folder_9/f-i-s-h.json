    "About the game": "Welcome, new intern, to the Department of F.I.S.H. ! We've assigned you to the city of [CLASSIFIED] in which major [CLASSIFIED] is being done and requires all fish be redirected away from any area deemed [CLASSIFIED] . The fish that frequent these roads are averse to reading our very clearly labelled safety signs, which is where YOU [insert name] come in! Your job is to use our STOP signs at just the right moment when a fish attempts to swim past you. Different fish have different timings and frequent different roads, so you'll have to rely on your sense of rhythm to ensure that [CLASSIFIED] stays safe! Awaiting you are 15 levels each with their own awesome music. At the end of each level, you'll be judged by three of our most skilled agents out of 10 for a total score out of 30. Score a 15/30 or higher, and you'll be granted access to the next level. Score anything below that, and you'll have to try it again before you can advance. And we'll also be very disappointed in you. No pressure! In your training, you'll learn how to deal with 5 different types of fish: Tuna, Salmon, Barracuda, Sailfish, and Swordfish. Each fish has a unique rhythmic timing that you must remember if you want to meet our standards. You can use either the left/right mouse button, the Space key, or the A key to input a STOP sign. As you progress, the levels will get trickier. Fish will get faster. Time signatures will change. Your sense of rhythm will be put to the ultimate test. Are you up for the task? - [CLASSIFIED] , Director of F.I.S.H.",
