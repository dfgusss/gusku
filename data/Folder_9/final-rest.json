    "About the game": "Have you ever faced your fears? Now you can in Final Rest. This is an experience that tests your fears, while you are undergoing surgery and you wake up in a nightmare. You will experience the story of the butcher, who used to roam the halls of the asylum, now turned hospital and experience what he has done to his victims first hand. Final Rest is a short non-interactive horror experience (approximately 4 minutes) that is intended to be given at a party using props. It allows a party host to scare the guest, while they are facing some of the many phobias people have like: rats, spiders, fierce dogs, hypodermic needles, blood, claustrophobia and even death itself. This experience was created with the idea of using props like a feather duster, can of compressed air, spray bottle of water and other items to give the guest an unexpected surprise while they are taken to their Final Rest. To win prizes upload your videos of your victims being frightened on social media using hashtag #FinalRestVR or reply to the trailer on Youtube and we will be choosing the winners bi-weekly and promoting your video on our social media sites.",
