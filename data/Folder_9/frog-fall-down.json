    "About the game": "~ Frog Fall Down is a game about a frog who falls down, a lot. ~ Oh No! Frog has fallen into a sinkhole, and only YOU can help him out of the pit and return him to the meadow from which he came. ~ Gameplay ~ Frog Fall Down is many things. A precision platformer, tailor designed to be imprecise. A philosophical wonder, making the player ask what the whole point of the pain was, and why a sane human would make such a game. A comedy, with the joke being you, the player. But most of all it's a psychological horror, for you to get so far, only to lose it all to one mistake. In theory your marble sized brain is responsible for two things: jumping and steering. Hold the jump button to charge Frog's legs, release it to jump, and use of the left and right buttons while airborne to steer Frog. Don't hit walls too hard. Don't fall too far. Simple. Do this repeatedly to pinball Frog out of these 5 layers of the skinhole: The Sump The Glacier The Mesa The Dustbowl The Meadow ~ Features ~ Enjoy an infuriating, and ultimately endless purgatory of frustrating features including but certainly not limited to: Janky Indie physics Nonsensical mechanics Environmental hazards Imprecise hitboxes Inaccurate depiction of frogs Many hate this game for being unfair. I mean... I'm not saying you're wrong... I'm saying you're bad...",
