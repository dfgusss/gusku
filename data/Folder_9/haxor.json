    "About the game": "FEATURES: Classic platformer based on hits of the 80s Original, pixel art style graphics Dynamic, demanding action (yes, we have rocket jumping!) A wide array of richly animated enemies and bosses A hero with a variety of special abilities DESCRIPTION: Haxor is an old-school action platformer inspired by the greatest hits of the 80s and 90s. Take the role of Kla, a member of a research expedition, and the only survivor of their vessel’s encounter with a black hole. Face hostile beasts and rediscover your true identity! Just like cult classics of the eight-bit era, the true essence of Haxor is its gameplay. Travel through four mysterious environments, searching for hidden secrets and collecting special items. Face a robust gallery of dangerous enemies, then test your mettle against terrifying bosses. Overcome these obstacles using Kla’s special abilities, which you will discover and develop throughout the game. Just like old times! An ancient race faces a lethal energy crisis. To counter this threat, a research expedition is sent straight into a black hole. The mission ends in failure… or does it? The sole survivor is Kla, who is rediscovering her true identity. The memories of the temperamental protagonist will transport you to regions unknown until you face her greatest curse... The audio-visual style of Haxor is based on that of the late 80s and early 90s games. Visit picturesque locations, created with classic pixel-art, enriched by the robust animations of enemies (including the biggest bosses) and our main character. Carefully composed, atmospheric chiptune music will enhance your experience throughout the adventure.",
