    "About the game": "Game Info The game that i am currently writing about is a slow/fast paced Roguelite game that revolves around killing enemies and picking up items/spells to kill more enemies. Game Features Every game is somewhat different from the last. Combine several spells with multiple different items to create mildly unique builds. Fight a diverse enemy pool of 10+ enemies based on the same re skin. SEVERAL Spells. MANY Items. ADEQUATE Diversity. COMPLICATED Ui. KNIFELIKE Melee mechanics. AFFORDABLE Graphics. SOME not annoying sound effects. SEMI Interesting Game play. Gameplay This game has extremely engaging gameplay where the player casts ability's in order to defeat enemies, after defeating the enemies the player may pick up a new item, spell or both in order to grow in power and have the opportunity to defeat even more enemies and pick up even more items and or spells, and then finally when having picked up enough items and or spells the player can fight a boss in order to get more items and or spells. Pick from more than 2 starting weapons. Combine spells in order to cast the same spells you combined but now combined. Fight your way through multiple levels containing some events. Discover additional random events that spawn between events. Kill various bosses after completing some events. Story/Lore PepeLaugh",
