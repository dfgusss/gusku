    "About the game": "There's nothing scarier than waking up in the middle of the forest alone... or so it seems. Taking control of Rachel in this exploration game, you must find out where you are, why you're there, and most importantly, how to get out. What will you uncover when you delve into the unknown? Into The Unknown was created by middle school students Conner Rush (Programming) and Rachel Bennett (Art). The first game ever created by FYRE Games, this is a short, suspensful, story based game. It's only about 20 - 25 minutes long, but our beta testers have all unanimously decided that it's well worth your time. All donations made to this game will go toward funding our future projects, so we highly encourage you donate! If you have any external reviews ( i.e. videos, articles, etc. ) we ask that you leave a link in the comments because you don't know how much we appreciate the feedback! NOTE: THIS IS NOT A SURVIVAL GAME! This is a story driven game with time to take in and explore your environment. There's no need to hunt for food or craft supplies. Just enjoy the story and enjoy the visuals. Thanks for playing!",
