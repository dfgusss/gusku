    "About the game": "Inverse Evolver is a side-scrolling roguelite with truly unlimited item combos. The over-reliance on transformation technology finally triggered a crisis. As the last survivor, will you fight against the cyborgs with flesh and blood, or will you gradually lose yourself while accepting transformation to gain transcendent power? TRULY UNLIMITED ITEM COMBOS The effects of hundreds of items will be used by you. Don't know which item to use? I want them all! All the properties of the items you get will be retained! This game will combine all the items in the way of The Binding of Isaac . The more the items, the more monstrous you will be! RANDOM DUNGEONS Each run will randomly generate completely different dungeons. Follow the plot and explore the endings of different branches. Nine characters, each with its own value and ability. Use the item combos you assembled to beat the bosses!",
