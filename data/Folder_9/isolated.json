    "About the game": "Our solar system has been invaded by strangers. For the purpose of a possible negotiation, a team of astronauts is sent to the moon. Alas, they are shot before even arriving on the scene. Only one astronaut survives the crash and his only goal will be to go home... GAMEPLAY Shoot enemy ships to avoid being invaded. Be precise in your movements, because it's better to lose a bit of life at the top than to lose it all at the bottom. Take out your drill to destroy the stones in your path. Validate your identity to cross the different laboratories. Reach the flag before losing your three lives. And all that... at the same time! Will you be able to go home? If the answer is yes, how long will it take? Enjoy 15 levels of complete action to escape yourself into the world of science fiction.",
