If Jetlad gets hit by an enemy or runs out of fuel he will lose a life. - Three checkpoints in each level Each level contains three checkpoints. A checkpoint becomes active when Jetad comes in contact with it. When you lose a life, you will spawn at the latest active checkpoint.

The green gem is usually hidden in tricky locations. - Play with a controller You can play with your favorite controller! * Steam Controller Settings must be turned off. * Controller must be connected before running the game",
