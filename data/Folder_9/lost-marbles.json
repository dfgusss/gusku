    "About the game": "Oh look, it's just another 'marble' game. What is this, 1984? Wait...I can control three marbles at once? Well that's completely different and kind of cool. I get to use my marbles together to solve puzzles, all with tight controls and awesome physics? Tell me more! Well thank you for asking. Each marble has a different material and special power: Rubber can jump, Paper can shrink, and Metal can boost. They interact with the world as you might expect: Rubber floats on water, Paper burns in fire, Metal uses its sheer mass to destroy things. Combine the strengths of each marble to overcome a multitude of hazards as you race to the end of each level in search of the fastest time! Welcome to Lost Marbles. We hope you enjoy your stay. *** You can download a demo for Windows or Mac from our site *** Key Features Challenging platforming mixed with puzzle solving Colorful visuals and charming music create a dazzling world Now with 40 levels! Hardcore Mode + unlockable skins Online leaderboards to challenge your friends Xbox 360 controller support 100% Indie and made by two guys. Is that really a feature?",
