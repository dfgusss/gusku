    "About the game": "M.U.S.T. (Memory Usage Set To) Repeat is a logical puzzle game in which tiny robot Q.T. is evaluated for its cognitive abilities by solving the puzzles in the scientific testing facility. If all the tests are completed successfully, it may even improve the future of the planet. Q.T. uses the unique Repeat mechanic to navigate the rooms and defeat enemies. The higher the Repeat is, the more difficult it is to navigate through the room, but you have to increase your Repeat in order to defeat the higher level Guard Bots. The test rooms are the only location in the game, but as the game progresses, you pass through the four different areas represented by new tilesets. The areas introduce new mechanics with which Q.T. must repeat the process of level completion in challenging and interesting ways while still using its core unique mechanic. Through repeating trial and error you can achieve the goal.",
