    "About the game": "PLEASE NOTE: This is intentionally a quick play -- by design, you can beat this game in about an hour . If you have some extra time, after you beat the game you can: unlock achievements, search for all the items, easily mod in your own items, try the new game+ mode, go outside, feed the baby, water the plants, realize you don't have a baby, water the plants again, oh god whose baby is this, eat some chili, eat the plants, etc, etc. Step 1: Craft weapons Create products by combining the natural resources of our glorious country. Refine those products to make weapons! How about... vodka + exercise machine = Vladimir Putin's gym shorts? Its manly odor is both powerful and deadly. Step 2: Automate your factory Now that you've figured out how to build one weapon, can you make hundreds of them? Build out your factory for mass production with conveyor belts, barriers, pushers, black holes... wait... why did you put a black hole in the factory?! Nooooo Step 3: EXTREME CAPITALISM! Now that we're mass producing weapons, we can sell those off and upgrade the factory to build more profitable (and complex) weapons. Discover new technology phases like Sand Age, Copper Age, Iron Age, and the most advanced technology: Potato Age. Features Craft weapons &amp; create huge factories New Game+ mode Cross-device cloud saving Create your own resources &amp; weapons in the Blueprint DB -- plus share your mods easily with the world via cloud mod sync Full game included, no microtransactions",
