    "About the game": "Emo, a lonely teenager, has decided to run away from home and walk Misery Street in pursuit of meaning. But the street brings out the worst within ones-self. Emo will have to overcome a world of delusional foes as well as the demons from his past. GAMEPLAY FEATURES Playtime of about 20+ hours with a unique NewGame+. The game will offer a linear path that can be completely ignored. A lot of optional text for those who wish to immerse themselves in the lore-rich world and characters. Very little mandatory text for those who just want to experience the gameplay and story. Balanced battles will force you to make critical decisions that should challenge even veteran players, but do not require deep RPG knowledge so they can be beaten by newcomers as well. A wide variety of weapons, skills, and armor that each has wildly different effects. A classic turn-based RPG experience with modern mechanics featuring autosaving, no grinding, visible overworld monsters, and more. A shy companion to talk to and bond with. Your relationship may affect the events to come. If you experience a lot of lag, please try the Lag Free Beta branch.",
