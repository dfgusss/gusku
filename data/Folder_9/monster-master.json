    "Name": "Monster Master",
    "Release date": "Apr 8, 2022",
    "About the game": "The game is currently early alpha quality. FPS heroes versus RTS horde. An asymmetric multiplayer where 1 player spawns the different monsters, and 3 class-based fps heroes try to survive it. The game is set in to the small town of Kingsfield, where an energy research facility has given birth to a cosmic horror entity called the monster master. Players can choose to control and mutate the monster horde or survive as a group of class based heroes with unique powers. The hero perspective is a thrilling unscripted experience where the monsters feel very intelligent. It suddenly is very quiet and you know 'It' is planning something. For the Monster master it feels like toying with other players. Dance puppets, dance! Before purchasing please be aware, that this game is in early alpha development and it is being actively updated. The core game is understandable and fun in a group of 4, but this is not a highly polished nearly launch quality early access game. We'd love to hear your honest feedback and that is why it’s in open development/ early access. Were most active in the monster master discord group.",
