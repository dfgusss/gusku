    "About the game": "This is a fun shooting game without actual violence. You play as a Chibi Good guy or Girl, in single or co-op mode, to save the 12 worlds then protect your castle. The game is a shooting action set in a fantasy world. Your general wants you to fight the bad guys. They call themselves The 'BAD GUYS'. Standard control with keyboard and mouse or a gamepad. Play to get as high score as possible. You get 1 point per kill but you lose 5 points every time you die. There's also a touch of puzzle to spice the game up and give you a little break from chibi action. Enough said. NOW, Go get them Chibi!!!",
