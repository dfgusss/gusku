    "About the game": "In the beginning there was a dot, levitating in white nothingness. Eons have passed and nothing has changed, but the power of creation was slowly stirring within the dot. And this is how the adventure begins! Qbik is a beautifully designed pixel-art puzzle game. Enter the world of Qbik and explore a square land full of brainteasers, puzzles, and riddles – traverse all 63 levels and discover the origin story of this square little fella! But that's not all, folks! Qbik gives you the ability to make your own cave in the Level Editor! Put your designs to the test on Steam Workshop and play on other players’ levels! Use every brain cell you have to help Qbik navigate the caves. Dodge deadly traps and use technology in your favor so you can eat every yellow block (hopefully they’re gluten free!) and move forward into the unknown! Features Pixel art graphic design Story to discover 63 levels to explore Level Editor",
