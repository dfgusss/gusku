    "About the game": "Racket: Nx is a new kind of game that challenges the limits of what you can do with a racket and ball in VR. The game is played inside a giant glass dome, the walls of which light up with targets you must destroy with the ball. But this is no ordinary ball! Hit it with force and it will slam into the wall, rolling across it and bulldozing everything in its path! Use your racket's tractor beam to pull it back, or simply to line up your next shot exactly where you want it. Be quick and plan your shots well. Learn to control the ball to perfection. Features: Two Single Player Modes - Play a campaign of hand crafted levels or an endless runner! Monthly Challenges - A new level, every month! Two Multiplayer Modes - Play competitive PvP matches or team up to play shoulder to shoulder Co-op games! Nx Spatial Audio - Racket: Nx is the only VR game to use Waves Audio's Nx technology. This tech is the best of its kind in simulating positional audio, increasing immersion and spatial awareness. Sick Original Soundtrack - We took some of the biggest names in Glitch, IDM and Psytrance, and put together a crazy OSD! Don't like that kind of music? Play your own playlist ingame! Streaming Cameras and MR Support - The game offers extensive MR support (including LIV), and to make things more fun, you can turn on our automatic action cameras for your spectators to enjoy.",
