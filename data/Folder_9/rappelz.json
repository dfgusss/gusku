    "About the game": "Do you want to play a game in a classic medieval setting where any monster can be tamed? Then you are welcome! Even if you're not a summoner, you're still a summoner! In the world of Rappelz, there are several hundred different monsters with their own unique skills that you can not only kill, but also tame, making them your allies! Pets develop with you, they can carry weapons and armor and help you in battle - some with a kind healing word, some with useful effects, and some with the good old “chopping the enemy into cabbage”. Free PvP at every turn! When leaving the city, do not forget to look around - the enemy can be anywhere, so you'd better get to the level where he will have to look back as soon as possible! The good news is that everyone you don't like can be attacked here and now, and you won't get punished for it. Pacifist's Choice: PvE and Quests If you are not yet ready for a head-on collision with other players, do not rush to give up the game. You can always hide from the villains in a cozy dungeon and quietly swing there. And starting from level 50, you will have access to an exciting chain of quests that will allow you to quickly level up and catch up with the “folders” of the game. Not a day without movement You will have a busy schedule: three days a week - the attack of the Destroyers, on weekends during the day - the battle for the Citadel, and in the evening - dungeon sieges, and the daily Bloody Battle. And also all sorts of events, endless rates and regular server buffs that will help you become stronger every day. The supply of gifts does not run out When you first enter the game, you will immediately receive ... No, not with a sword in the nose, but a gift! Each newbie gets a set of delicious consumables that will allow you to comfortably fly up to level 150 and above. And every week you can get valuable sets of gifts in the “Gifts” section of the game store. Runs even in the microwave... mostly Rappelz is a game from those classic times when even your grandfather's device was considered a decent computer. And although it has evolved a lot since then, its system requirements have not increased much, and it will work perfectly even on weak PCs.",
