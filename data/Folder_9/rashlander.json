    "About the game": "RASHLANDER is a lunar lander roguelike that feels like spinning across an icy road and nailing a perfect parallel park. Combining the of Arcade Classics like Asteroids and Lunar Lander with design from games like Downwell and Spelunky, RASHLANDER merges the simplicity of the arcade with the magic of a modern roguelike. The procedurally generated levels encourage players to build ability instead of memorizing patterns, creating real challenge and truly triumphant wins. Discover a dense network of game-changing upgrade systems and life-giving fuel stations—all while attempting to achieve the highest score in this skill-based, physics-stuffed tribute to the golden era of arcades. Skillfully slingshot around levels—dodging interstellar debris, scraping past gravity-heavy asteroids, and avoiding GovCorp drones—to successfully crash-land onto the goal-marked warp pads. You’ll want to land your ship feet-first, though; unless you’re a fan of incinerating your entire crew in super-explodey collisions. FEATURES Lunar Lander Roguelike : A modern arcade experience with a strong pick-up-and-play appeal for players who like a challenge. Was originally made for physical arcade cabinets. Upgrade System : Discover a network of upgrades and tradeoffs on each run. Heroically rewire the engine or let the intern press the Big Red Button. Your choice (doom?). Secrets : Contemplate 'Eggplant Run', 'Time Travel', etc. Impactful Visuals : Stylized art design featuring a love for chunky pixels, vibrant color schemes, and dynamic shadow effects. Heart Thumping Soundtrack : Synthesized, beat-heavy bops by Fat Bard, whose prior compositions appear in work for Disney, WB Games, and Butterscotch Shenanigans. Twitch Integration : When activated, Streamers participate in viewer driven events, chat meta games, and chat members appearing as helpers or enemies in-game. Enables Streamers to interact with and engage their communities as they play. Daily Runs : Compete or nose dive on online high score tables while discovering a new, game altering theme every week. Designed for the speedrunner and high-score-chaser in us all.",
