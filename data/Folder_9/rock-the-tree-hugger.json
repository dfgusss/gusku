    "About the game": "'Rock, the Tree Hugger' is a casual arcade-style game where you must 'save' humans and 'hug' trees all while rushing against an impending forest fire in increasingly harder levels. The goal of 'Rock, the Tree Hugger' is to 'save' a certain number of humans and 'hugging' a certain amount of tree score. You are a rock rolling around colored forests with one goal: avoid the fire; and 'save' humans, AND 'hug' trees! You control the rock by holding down left-mouse button and moving the mouse around. Green trees give you normal score. Red trees speed you up, like taking Methamphetamine. Blue trees slow you down, like after taking Methamphetamine. Yellow trees give you double score. Orange trees reduce your size, like working out. Purple trees increases your size, like eating donuts. Humans increase your 'save humans' score. Save has apostrophes for a reason... Fire will kill you. Don't touch fire. Can you hug all the trees, and save all the humans?",
