    "About the game": "This is an adventure and platforming game where you play as a Roly Poly. You know, one of those bugs you sometimes see outside, often when lifting up a rock? They might be regional or found all over the world? Basically they're these insects that roll into a ball, it's literally all they're known for. Game Features: Roll into a ball. Explore a forest from a tiny perspective. Climb on sticks and leaves. Talk with other rollies, some might even offer you a quest! Eat different foods. Discover the multiple mind-blowing endings, from maneuvering down Ribbit's Water Slide, to mastering the Bouncy Mushroom Forest, to enduring the terrible cave which houses unspeakable evil or maybe even collecting the rare gems to become the chosen one of the great Roly Poly prophecy that will bring you to a new plane of existence as told by the ancients. Push around small rocks. You will also learn interesting facts about these lovable lil guys. DID YOU KNOW that they eat heavy metals, removing them from damaging the environment? ..But they just release the metals back into the environment after some time... They temporarily help so that's good? Give the environment a little breather? Birds and stuff eat them so they're a food supply but it's not like there's other bugs that can't be eaten.. They also damage crops which isn't a good thing... But seriously you'd think that these bugs would have some kind of unique history or lore. There isn't a ton of information about them. Compare them to ladybugs who have several sections and cool facts about their history with Norse mythology and nursery rhymes. Imagine being a roly poly finding out you're only known for rolling into balls and people can't even agree what to call you, roly polies, pillbugs, potato bugs? And you wonder why they roll into those balls, they're probably depressed.",
