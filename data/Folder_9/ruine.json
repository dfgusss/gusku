    "About the game": "Ruine is a 2D dungeon crawler that scratches the classic fantasy RPG itch. Fight creatures to level up. Delve into the darkest corners of derelict ruins in search of treasure and gear. But to keep what you find, you must first make it out 'alive.' Using the term loosely. Story The rules of nature have become rather twisted, you see. Long ago, the kingdom entered an age of darkness and decay. Fog covered the land as unrecognizable things crawled from the crypts, and once tamed beasts turned feral with little regard for their owners. Now not a soul is left alive, nor are they allowed to die, mere husks doomed to seek fleeting joy in the forgotten kingdom of Ruine for eternity.",
