    "About the game": "Snow Ash Land is a multiplayer post-apocalyptic top-down shooter game with rpg mechanics and survival in semi-open world. It simulates a dying society in a post-apocalyptic world. Guided by factions with very different ideologies, the player can choose to help rebuild civilization or destroy humanity. There's a lot of interractions between players in multiplayer mode : Guilds , pvp territory wars , resources and informations exchanges, language, politics, economy, building... Each player can be a piece of a huge whole, choose a profession with its importance in the workings of the political and economic system of the game, whose effectiveness and utility will depend on the professions of the other players. You will need each other to do your job effectively and succeed in creating some semblance of economic and social stability or you can be part of those who want the end of old societies. The game will have a strong dominant roleplay ,but without frustrating players who would simply like to fight and play competitively ,they will be able to choose a faction in which they can compete against each other without suffering any malus or bonus. As for players who wanted to play more in the atmosphere of the game,they can choose a simple citizen job so they will be protected by bonuses that will make others think twice before shoot them. The player will have to explore the world to understand the past, how the world became what it is today. Some characters are the keys to history, they will give the player a lot of information to understand. With these elements it will then be possible to make choices, to decide which faction defends the path that you think is best.....",
