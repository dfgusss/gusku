    "About the game": "Welcome to the STEELPAW tournament, where the world's fiercest warriors gather to compete for glory, financial independence, and high fives all around. Gather your friends, customize your character, and prepare to have a wild time with SIZZLING HOT online 4-player matches. As a cape-bearing, jet-equipped animal, use your hip-mounted jets to dash circles around your opponents and knock them out of the ring with your powerful blade! The STEELPAW tournament spans many arenas, each with their own attributes to master. Here are the are places you can expect to do battle so far, with more to come! Watermelon Island This island is a great place to learn the ropes! See those boulders that pepper the island? If you dash into them you can get a little extra air. Enough to gain a slight advantage. After knocking your opponent into the ruby sea below, take a moment to soak in the peaceful ambiance. The Moon Not content to keep the festivities of battle contained to their own planet, the STEELPAW tournament rages on the surface of the moon. Dash off of the edges of a crater, and the low gravity here will let you float high into the sky. Is it still called the sky if you're on the moon? The extraterrestrials who call this arena their home don't take kindly to trespassers. Watch out for their flying saucers-- if they catch you in your blind spot you'll be in a world of hurt! Tinfil City Gear Factory Fighting on these spinning gears can be tricky! This factory's responsible for manufacturing all sorts of things, such as the hip-mounted dash thrusters that are so popular among STEELPAW's fighters. Dragontear Island This would-be quiet island is inhabited by a family of fire-breathing dragons! If you hit them enough with your charged attack you might able to knock them out, but careful-- a single taste of their fiery breath can be lethal! Last Location This arena is an unrelenting cylinder, strutting high into the sky. If you get knocked off it will be a challenge to make it back to safety. Do you have the determination to combine your wall jumps and air dashes to recover? Well? Can you feel the heat? Customize your character and battle with other players online, or against the CPU across 5 stages in strategic 1v1 duels or chaotic 4-player free-for-all matches!",
