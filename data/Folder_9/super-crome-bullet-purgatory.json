    "About the game": "The year is 40XX. Since the establishment of the Galactic Consul peace has reigned, but as of late a cold unease has settled into the barren soil of the colonies. It began at first with the odd distress signal — a company freighter lost in the dormant starfields, an occasional satellite having seemingly vanished from a backwater planet. Now, entire solar systems have slipped into the encroaching ink sweeping across the outskirts, and maddened whispers speak of a force beyond the void — Purgatory. As mankind’s only hope for survival, Crome must eliminate dozens of waves of cosmic beasts and ships to escape the dark abyss. Thankfully, his sleek ship comes equipped with devastating weapons and a precise dashing ability; a perfect combination for slaying alien scum. Take control of Crome as he hunts down hordes of galactic monstrosities and bring back peace in this retro-inspired bullet hell. Fire your way through fast-paced dynamic combat scenarios and dash through overwhelming bullet patterns Face off against 20+ beasts, ships, and astral fiends Challenge colossal bosses Harness an arsenal of destructive weapons and abilities Challenge friends on a competitive leaderboard and secure your spot as the Galactic Consul’s most skilled pilot Annihilate enemies to level up Crome’s ship and upgrade its firing speed",
