    "About the game": "Choose the mode that fits your mood. Go it alone in solo mode, battle with a partner in duos, or field a four-person team in squads. Loot, loot everywhere. Famous firearms, melee weapons, throwables, medical items, armor, scopes, and backpacks to hold it all. Raid an air drop to get the rarest loot! Tired of looting the same set of static locations every game? surviv.io features something no other Battle Royale offers: a completely new map in each game. Every rock, tree, building, bunker, and river spawns in a randomly chosen place using our intelligent map generation tech. The surviv.io dev team is dedicated to keeping the game fresh and exciting. We believe in frequent updates and open communication with the community. Join us on Discord and say hello! Every feature and every update completely in-sync between PC, desktop, and mobile. Play with your friends, regardless of their device.",
