Features: 5 Bot Classes: Customize your own team to fit your favorite play style &gt; TracerBot: The sharpshot.

He has dreams of becoming a rhino, but alas, his head bears no horn, despite his huge metal frame. &gt; AcidBot: The potionsmaster. Insists that the world would be better off drenched in acid. &gt; PullBot: The professional hugger. He'll pull you close, even from a distance, and get you right where he wants you. &gt; CreatorBot: The lonely mad scientist.
