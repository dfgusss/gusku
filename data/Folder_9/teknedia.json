    "About the game": "A Pulse-Pounding Platformer in a Neon Fueled Dreamscape. Teknedia is a fast paced, first person platforming game where you dodge mines, leap over lasers, and race your way to finish! Jump your way through dozens of vibrant, neon-infused levels, and unlock the mysteries behind this alien world. With a built in leaderboard, compete against your friends and players around the world to see who's the fastest ! And with VR Support, get ready to shoot this neon directly into your eyeballs. Features 4 Vibrant worlds to bound through Leaderboards VR Support A lengthy puzzle that has a dubious reward at the end... Our Story We started this game back when we were in college, and (while it admittedly took us a bit longer to make this than it 'should') we're really happy it to show the world. It all started as a loose collection of what we as a team liked: simple yet hard platforming, lasers, electronic music, puzzles with many layers, and the Quake 3's map editor (ya, that's a weird one...). From there, it went from student project to startup project to a way to stay connected. So, thanks for stopping by, and we hope you enjoy our odd, little game &lt;3",
