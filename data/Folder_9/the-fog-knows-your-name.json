    "About the game": "Step into the fog to confront your terror: the evil that hides within. The Fog Knows Your Name is a 300,000 word interactive teen horror novel by Clio Yun-su Davis, where your choices control the story. It's entirely text-based, without graphics or sound effects, and fueled by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination. It's senior year of high school. Your classmate Rex Keller was found dead six months ago, and you were the last person to see him alive. Half the town thinks you murdered him, including his sister, Ennis. The other half believes it was the fog. In your town, ever since anyone can remember, people die when the fog rolls in. No one knows exactly how or why. Some say the land didn't want the colonizers, so it sends the fog as an agent of vengeance. Some say the Devil himself lurks in the fog, collecting souls. Others believe the fog simply drives people mad, causing them to enact violence onto each other and onto themselves. There is one element of the tale that remains the same in every telling: those who perish in the fog are guilty of wronging another without confessing to it. Those who admit to causing harm can walk in the fog untouched. The liars die. Their ghosts haunt the town. They're haunting you, they're haunting Ennis Keller, and they're haunting your friends at school. If you and your friends can't unravel the fog's mysteries in time, those ghosts are going to kill you, one way or another. Play as female, male, or non-binary; gay, straight, bi, ace, aromantic, or poly. Stop the thing in the fog and exorcise the ghosts who haunt your town. Enter the fog and die. Solve murders. The clues are just waiting in the fog. Entangle yourself in romances with your friends and enemies. Protect the town that despises you or take vengeance against them.",
