    "About the game": "The Tension is a stealth-based puzzle horror game. It's a game where the player can see the character from the top camera view and control it. The main mentality of the game taken from Alien Isolation. While there are still few things to do, most of the game complete. You will be controlling a kid who got kidnapped by aliens. You will be trying to escape from their mother ship. You will have tense moments while looking for your ship and escape from the alien mothership and solve puzzles on the way. All levels have some kind of puzzles inside. Some have enemies that you will need to avoid. There are different kind of puzzles in this game. I tried to balance the puzzle difficulty depending of the level. You will need to solve each and every one of them in order to proceed to next level. Once you complete a level you can either go to next level or you can repeat the same level to get the higher score. The score is determined by the time you spend in a level. The time stops when you pause the game which happens in few different ways. The game currently in English and Turkish languages. There will be multiple languages (which already translated but not implemented yet) . What this game can provide: Multiple levels that are unlockable Story based single player mode Different puzzle systems Tense environment Amazing musics Who am I? My name is Yigit and this is my first game which is almost complete. I'm writing this game since 2016 November and working mostly by myself. Im the developer. There are few friends who added important things to the game like scenario, music etc. You can all see their names in credits scene. Since this is my first game to publish Im sure there will be things that needs improvement. Please dont hesitate to contact me for any suggestions or feedback Things to improve/add: Enemy AI system. - Rewritten Xbox controller support - Added Mac version - Added End Scene animations - Added More languages for the scenario and UI(Turkish,Russian,Chinese,German etc) Star system for each level need organising - Done Cloud saving system Achievements need to be implemented to different levels - Done Different language options for achievements Few different ideas for improving the game",
