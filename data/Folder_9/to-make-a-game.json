    "About the game": "Inspired by Nikita Kryukov's 'Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk' To Make a Game is a meta visual novel retelling my experience as a developer making this very game. While this game can be a form of entertainment it is also a deeply personal experience I had. (Although dramatized and peppered with some alternative endings). I wish it to be experienced as a form of art before a game. Features Short gameplay (13-24 minutes) Atmospheric audio Pixelated graphics",
