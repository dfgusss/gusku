    "About the game": "TrainerVR is a unique physics-based VR train construction game. In TrainerVR you can create from simple tracks to an elaborate rail network, just like the wooden piece game, but to the infinity and beyond, and drive the trains inside your creations! Have you ever feel the despair of running out of tracks just when the fun was sparkling? Have you ever dreamed about a huge train network connecting towns, going up and down, intersecting and looping? If you liked building with your own bare hands, you’ll feel the same in our limitless VR world and see your dreams come true. But this is not only about the destination; it's also about the journey. Enjoy building your structures, growing more complex, while fighting against Newton’s laws. Once the job is done you can place as many trains as you want and ensure everyone’s safety avoiding crashes acting like a proffesional train traffic controller. Once you go track you can't go back. Come aboard! Some models by Google Poly licensed under CC BY license",
