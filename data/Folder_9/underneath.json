    "About the game": "The Citadel attracts many, but only a few reach the bottom, where in the depths of the floors lies the hope for those who are ready to lose everything, just to get a chance ... for a miracle? I see, you are just one of those. What are you longing for? Wealth? Power? Maybe immortality? Or maybe it cannot be described in simple words? But do not make so far, maybe you will just perish on the first floors *loud evil laughter*. Underneath is a two-dimensional beat ‘em up with rouge-like elements. The player accompanies his hero to the bottom of the Citadel, where many enemies and traps are waiting for him, and with the help of new artifacts and abilities, he tries to break his way down to the cherished goal – the Wish. Key Features - Randomly generated floors, opponents, artifacts and bosses. The Citadel never remains the same and with each passage offers new emotions and adventures. - Three biomes, at the end of which a unique boss blocks the passage further. To pass them, you have to try pretty hard. - New characters, artifacts, abilities and biomes will be constantly added to the game. The Citadel is filled with riddles and secrets that attract more and more adventurers. - Various endings. - A variety of walkthroughs due to the player's choice of ways to upgrade his abilities and through selection of different artifacts. - Additional game modes.",
