    "About the game": "Universal Enemies is a depth-scrolling action shooting game that supports a variety of play styles: alone, with the CPU, or with friends. Each stage can be played in a short period of time, so you can conquer it little by little in your free time. Once a stage has been cleared, you can play it again and again by selecting the stage. There are also stages with bosses and mini-games. Please enjoy the story with the cute monsters. Main features Deep scrolling: Move forward to the back of the screen and defeat the monsters coming at you from the front! Story: The story of the heroes' organization and the hostile organization that uses the monsters. Diverse stages: A variety of locations on land, sea, and in the air, and a variety of monsters await you. Short play time: Each stage is short, so you can play a little at a time in your spare time. Cooperative play: You can play locally with up to four players, or team up with the CPU by yourself. Mini-games: Shoot, infiltrate, and race your way through the game! Local multiplayer support. Split screen: The infiltration and racing mini-games are split-screen and each can be moved as desired. Retro style: Switch the screen to retro style.",
