This will be one of the best supports you will give us as it will contribute to the acceleration of game development. Your thoughts are valuable to us. Tech Of The Game The development of Unsolved Stories started with Unreal Engine 3 three years ago. We made good work with special lighting and other systems we developed on Unreal engine 3 but it was not enough for us. Unreal Engine 4 'Open World has impressed us with the development of new and impressive systems for projects. And with an extra 4 months of work we transferred the chicago map and systems back to the UE4. Thanks to UE4, Unsolved Stories has begun to produce much more impressive images and increase performance. We will start sharing the latest version of the project with new videos soon. We think to share the details with you in the future. Map Details We have three different map based on real world locations instead of a virtual space. For us this is the biggest factor that makes Unsolved Stories the original. The contents we prepare are very close to real world references and we did not avoid any expense to catch a very realistic city atmosphere. Finally, every object has been designed for Unsolved Stories by our graphic team for many days. If you want to review the development steps, you can reach the latest pictures from the oldest pictures from our Artwork and twitter page. You might want to see hundreds of development images, in high resolution. All images are taken from old and new game engine. Finally We worked very hard for three years to prepare the Chicago map for the first part of this project. The map of the first episode is almost done and we will then concentrate on working on playing. It is our first goal to prepare the Gameplay Systems of Unsolved Stories as soon as possible. Finally, Unsolved Stories will continue to improve in every condition without slowing down.
