    "About the game": "Warhammer Underworlds: Online is a digital adaptation of the explosive, high-stakes, turn-based strategy tabletop game from Games Workshop that pits mighty warbands from the Age of Sigmar universe against one another in an eternal player versus player battle for Glory. Choose a warband, build your decks and carve a path to victory using dice-and-card mechanics that offer boundless strategic depth. ASSEMBLE YOUR WARBAND Trapped within the towering spires of the Mirrored City of Shadespire , two warbands battle it out for survival - each with unique abilities and a distinct combat style. Choose to play as the valiant Stormcast Eternals armed with heaven-forged weaponry, or the merciless Blood Warriors of Khorne , tearing apart their enemies with the aid of their loyal Flesh Hound. With more warbands entering the city as DLC in regular updates, who knows who you’ll be fighting in the winding streets of Shadespire? CRAFT YOUR DECK Your success is measured in Glory points - awarded for achieving objectives and vanquishing your foes. Deckbuilding is the strategic heart of Warhammer Underworlds: Online . Your 20-card power deck is filled with clever gambits and powerful upgrades you’ll need to inflict maximum damage. Your 12-card objective deck will shape your tactical approach to a match, allowing you to score Glory by fulfilling specific conditions. In Warhammer Underworlds: Online cards are split into warband-specific cards and Universal cards. Unlike the physical game ALL FUTURE UNIVERSAL CARDS WILL BE FREE , and will be added to the game in regular release packs. Diversify your decks with new cards, and dive back into competitive ranked play ! CLAIM THE SPOILS OF SHADESPIRE As you play casual or ranked matches with each unique warband, advance through a rewarding progression system. Earn cosmetic content including warband skins, deck portraits, and player titles! Only those who have proven themselves in the unforgiving streets of Shadespire will be able to claim these rewards.",
