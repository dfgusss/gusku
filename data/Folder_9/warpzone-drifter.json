    "About the game": "Breakless drifter retro-hardcore arcade game, made by the same creator of the UBERMOSH series. Your job is to drift to specific nodes to stabilize areas of the Warpzone (an unstable parallel dimension used for transportation). Moving tentacles, limited time, procedural levels and the inability to break are elements of the challenge. Controls and Gameplay You can move left or right, using any of the analog gamepad sticks or keyboard's Arrows (or A-D, Q-D, Z-X...). The accessible controls have to team up with player´s fast reflexes, quick navigation, and piloting skill with physics elements. Beat your personal best scores while dealing with experimental gameplay, randomized levels, kinda-smart tentacles, eggs and vintage nodes for extra scores. No breaks.",
