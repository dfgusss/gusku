    "Name": "Wigmund",
    "Release date": "Mar 28, 2022",
    "About the game": "Two twin brothers. A fellowship of warriors. And only one true King. We present an RPG set up in a medieval fantasy world inspired by those cultures - Anglo-Saxon and Celtic - who were explored by J.R.R. Tolkien as well. Play as Wigmund, a young warrior tasked with the disinterring of the New Regime's dark secrets. Travel an open-world, rich with outlaw camps, ruined castles, dangerous caverns and forgotten ruins to explore. As in any respectable fantasy story, the dragons will have a special place in the quests. To understand and follow the narrative of the game is crucial for solving these quests. KEY FEATURES: Unique gameplay Control Wigmund's sword with gestures, your mouse becoming an extension of his weapon. It is really different from anything else that you've played and it might take practice before you can master it. That is not all, getting out of trouble with dodges and rolls is also required! No boss fight can be a simple stand-still hack &amp; slash but an opportunity to prove your sword mastery. Tapping a single key or your mouse will not get you very far. Intuitive controls : Move with WASD, attack once with a left click. Swipe the mouse to your left and your hero will slash to the left, swipe the mouse to your right and your hero will slash to the right. Story : Discover a complex and intricate story about the unexpected adventures of the hidden knights. Allies : The task is too great for you to handle alone. Build your elite guerilla team of three and venture forth through unfathomable danger. Detailed equipment : In addition to standard equipment items various other character equipment pieces were added, like tomes, knee-guards and arm-guards. Invest the reagents and rewards you collect along the journey in equipment. Special attacks : Crush your foes with devastating special attacks that will give you the upper hand in a battle. Preternatural skills : Unleash various up-gradable preternatural abilities that will aid you in battle, either defensively or offensively. Specializations : You are not limited by classes. Develop your character in favor of speed, health, damage or preternatural abilities.",
