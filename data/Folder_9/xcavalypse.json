    "About the game": "Months after a zombie apocalypse, a displaced group of survivors have come to the task to take back the city in an unconventional way, not with machetes and shotguns, but with a fleet of excavators! Early Access Features Original and fun Multiplayer gameplay Destructible Environments Great graphics Low cost Message from the developer XCavalypse is being developed entirely by myself trying to make a living out my passion. As a gamer myself i find a disconnection between big publishers that only want to milk you and me with 'hollywood recipies' kind of games without any new concept or idea behind it. XCavalypse is just a game i would like to play myself.",
