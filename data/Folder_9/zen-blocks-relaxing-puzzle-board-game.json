The use of hand-eye coordination with the Dual Stick Controller to complete the required screen actions in either timed or level mode will prove a challenge to most. Stack a color block next to other blocks of the same color. Combine 4+ color blocks to remove a group and gain extra moves / time (5+ blocks). Connect blocks in a line or diagonally as long as they touch. Blocks groups of the same color also need to be 'activated' by a direct hit. This allows for strategic hoarding of blocks to increase score and gain extra move turns. * Some Playing Tips * Activations can be made by any color block. e.g. A blue block can hit and activate a group of orange blocks A block going from left to right across the board will attach to other blocks in its path providing there is a space for it Placing blocks next to each other in a large group without activating will allow you to group up 5+ blocks Blocks can be grouped if they touch side by side or diagonally RELEASING BLOCKS Clicking the activators around the board perimeter releases a block. Hold down the mouse to see the direction line of the block. The block displayed below the board area is the current block that will be released. Clear the screen to advance to the next level. The game plays with relaxing music to create a calming and enjoyable gaming experience and also comes with a Learning mode . There are 3 modes of play currently... 1. LEVEL MODE : Level progression, where player must advance through puzzle levels that increase in difficulty, using a limited amount of moves and your brain. Players can take their time choosing their next move. 2. TIMER MODE : The second play mode is one that produces procedural levels that increase in difficultly along with a countdown timer. Win extra time by activating 5+ blocks together. This requires fast thinking to advance to the next level. You need to keep a clear head and remain calm to advance far on the timer play mode. This mode is not relaxing unless you get into the zone and feel as one with the blocks. :) 3. ARCADE MODE : Starts slowly, but as time passes more blocks emerge on the board to clear away. The blocks are released from the heavens by the spirits that float around your screen.
