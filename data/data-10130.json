    "poster": "https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/pUL8RNha6Ew0weQXtCcly3craH0.jpg",
    "director": "Michael Drumm",
    "movie_id": "21578",
    "release_date": "2005-07-30",
    "runtime": "99",
    "overview": "Political comedy about the Government (domestic and foreign policies), the president, the public's own ignorance and faults, and so forth. He also makes some hilarious detours in his own renditions of rap lyrics read out in proper, coherent (non-Ebonic) language. There are also some very poignant pieces on Bush, religion, drugs (notably marijuana), which then link to homeland security. Unlike a comedian like George Carlin who may go from topics in the 'big world' in his act to things in the 'little world' like spotting the random things in life, Maher is very much a comedian of the times, on the attack but clear about his political allegiances."
