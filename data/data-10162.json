    "overview": "Carl Barron’s topics jump from one to the other and back again, until you find yourself helpless with laughter. What a show this was; a mixture of stand up, musical attempts and crazy facial expressions. Barron captured his audience from the word “go”. People were laughing so hard they were either crying or nearly falling out of their chairs."
