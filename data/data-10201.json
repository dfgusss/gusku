Victim of three violent hold-ups in a year, which left no survivors, the company is on the verge of bankruptcy and its employees are extremely worried. Some even suggest a complicity between the robbers and the firm.  It is in this difficult context that a man, Alexandre Demarre, one morning presents himself to start his first day of work at Vigilante."
