During the recent book promotion tour he meets a sister of a former patient he committed to a mental institution in Spain. She asks if he will visit her sister, as her current carers have given up on helping her. His return to the city that once he had lived and worked reawakens subconscious memories of the hidden history ... he begins to remember."
