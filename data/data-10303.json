    "overview": "Soichi Negishi moved to Tokyo to chase his dream of becoming a musician playing stylish, Swedish-style pop. Instead, he finds himself leading the death metal band Detroit Metal City, or DMC, as the costumed and grotesquely made-up \"demon emperor\" Johannes Krauser II. Although he hates the role and the things he has to do as a member of the band, he has a definite talent for it."
