    "overview": "The President of the United States, in the midst of negative public opinion, is kidnapped while attending a charity function. However, this is all part of a plan to boost his ratings, the 'kidnappers' being a CIA black ops team. It seems like a great idea until the leader of the black ops decides he can make it away with the ransom money himself, but one of his team has other ideas."
