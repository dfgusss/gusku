    "overview": "The film is a parody of Disney's Fantasia, though possibly more of a challenge to Fantasia than parody status would imply. In the context of this film, \"Allegro non Troppo\" means Not So Fast!, an interjection meaning \"slow down\" or \"think before you act\" and refers to the film's pessimistic view of Western progress (as opposed to the optimism of Disney's original)."
