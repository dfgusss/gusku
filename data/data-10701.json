However, no one is aware of Angel's involvement in a secret medical beauty enhancement program headed by Dr. Lindstrom. Desperate to win, Angel overdoses on Lindstrom's formula, with disastrous results. Soon she has grown to monstrous but shapely proportions, causing all sorts of complications, the most dangerous being Betty's jealousy of Angel's new-found attention. Betty discovers Angel's secret and takes the formula herself, causing her to grow into an equally gorgeous giant. As the girls battle it out on Hollywood Blvd., Dr. Lindstrom races to find an antidote."
