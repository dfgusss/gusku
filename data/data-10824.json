    "overview": "Esmeralda is a teenager with an unusual obsession: she collects lost, forgotten or discarded objects from people she doesn't know and keeps them in a box beneath her bed. This is the tale of three objects in the box and the people behind them, all in some way incapable of relating to the person they love most. It is also a tale of the box itself, and of how Esmeralda learns to open it, to feel and to hoard the most valuable thing of all: human relations."
