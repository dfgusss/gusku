Ellis decides it's time for a change and enrolls in a course called \"How to Marry a Millionaire.\" Together with her fellow students, she goes hunting for rich bachelors. While the other students make shameless attempts to catch a millionaire, Ellis turns out to be a heartbreaker for the lonely millionaire! Everyone tries to impress her in their own way... But who will win Ellis' heart? Will she choose wealth, stability, or passion?"
