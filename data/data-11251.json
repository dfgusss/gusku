    "overview": "When four college students trek to the Everglades to conduct extra-credit research for their biology professor, they become prey to a huge man-eating eel with nasty incisors that’s been terrorizing a nearby Florida community, based on a true story concerning an exotic species of eels that are released in the southeast from Asia. They breathe air and can survive on land."
