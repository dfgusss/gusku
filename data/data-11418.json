    "overview": "Matilde is a nun convinced that faith moves mountains. She secretly begins a mystic fasting to end what she considers to be the second great flood. Elena is a thin and fashion-conscious woman ashamed of her daughter's chubbiness. She's willing to do the impossible to make her daughter Linda thin so Linda will look like a little princess on the day she receives her first communion. At the same time Elena's husband Gustavo - a professor of architecture - cannot cope with his wife's bones poking him during intimate moments so he turns his attention to a buxom female student with a hearty appetite."
