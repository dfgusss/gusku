    "overview": "When George Carlin is asked which HBO concert is his favorite, his answer is always, \"Jammin’ In New York.\" The show, taped at the Paramount Theater in Madison Square Garden and winner of the 1992 CableACE Award, is a perfect blend of biting social commentary and more gently-observed observational pieces."
