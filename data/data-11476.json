    "overview": "ZERO: An Investigation into 9/11 has one central thesis: that the official version of the events surrounding the attacks on 9/11 cannot be true. This feature documentary explores the latest scientific evidence and reveals dramatic new witness testimony, which directly conflicts with the U.S. government's account."
