    "overview": "After losing his restaurant, chef CLAY MAGUIRE must start his career all over--at the bottom. Pushing forty with no \"corporate skill-set\", Clay enters the strange world of the Unemployable Interviewees of America. Clay and his fellow job-seekers strive for dignity, success, or at least a job taking customer service calls from prison inmates for minimum wage. A hilarious, insightful look at job interviews, finding the courage to start all over, and life at the ENTRY LEVEL."
