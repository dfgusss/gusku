Morgan, Handleman and Van Dorn, he fights to deliver adequate care to needy veterans in the face of funding cuts and a corrupt administration. To succeed, the staff may have to bend the rules and circumvent the villainous \"Article 99,\" a bureaucratic loophole that prevents veterans from receiving the benefits they deserve."
