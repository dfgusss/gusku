So, who better to lead The Wiggles on an animal adventure than the Crocodile Hunter himself?! That's right, Steve Irwin, together with his wife Terri and daughter Bindi, have teamed up with The Wiggles for a wiggly, giggly good time at Australia Zoo. Come along on a song-and-dance-filled adventure with the dingos, emus, kookaburras and more. But don't forget, on this safari, crocs rule! Crikey, get ready t0 wiggle!"
