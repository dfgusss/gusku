Reigning over everything from television sitcoms to feature films, this comedienne extraordinaire has returned in her second solo HBO comedy special, I’MA BE ME. Live from Washington, D.C. and edgier than ever, Wanda holds nothing back as she riffs on the perks of having a Black president, coming out, getting married, motherhood, aging, and twenty-first century pirates.
