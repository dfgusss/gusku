    "overview": "Three friends from the neighborhood – Adi, Pele and Chemist – are often referred to as freeloaders, morons, losers. This is a gross simplification! In fact they are underestimated by the world. It hasn't appreciated them YET. Life presents them with challenges and difficulties, like bad luck at work or mentally ill neighbor's dog or a grandmother who steals their hashish. But they do not give up!"
