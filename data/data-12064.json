    "overview": "Eva Dandridge has been in charge of her younger sisters ever since their parents died many years ago. She is a very uptight young woman who constantly meddles in the affairs of her sisters and their significant others. Her brothers-in-law, who are tired of Eva interfering in their lives, decide to set her up with someone so she can leave them alone. They end up paying Ray, the local \"playboy,\" $5,000 to date her. The plan goes by smoothly, but trouble comes when Ray actually falls in love with Eva."
