    "overview": "In 2009, a group of military enthusiasts led by the commander France (Gojmir Lešnjak - Gojc) decides to occupy Trieste. The group that stages battles performs it at a completely fictional location. However, this hobby is not to the liking of France's wife Marija (Silva Čušin) and his daughter Mateja (Anja Drnovšek). The daughter as a representative of the young generation has no understanding of her father's enthusiasm for partisans, battles and Tito. France is also confronted by the Slovenian police led by the commander Brane (Dario Varga) as Brane forbids France to stage any more battles ... Will the young generation accept our history and will Trieste be ours?"
