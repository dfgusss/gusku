    "overview": "This documentary from Albert and David Maysles follows the bitter rivalry of four door-to-door salesmen working for the Mid-American Bible Company: Paul \"The Badger\" Brennan, Charles \"The Gipper\" McDevitt, James \"The Rabbit\" Baker and Raymond \"The Bull\" Martos. Times are tough for this hard-living quartet, who spend their days traveling through small-town America, trying their best to peddle gold-leaf Bibles to an apathetic crowd of lower-middle-class housewives and elderly couples."
