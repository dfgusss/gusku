    "overview": "A grisly murder occurs on the small remote island known as Paradise. After a night of gambling, two of the players are found mutilated. Deok-Su, the missing third player, quickly becomes the suspect. As the 17 residents of Paradise Island try to stay calm, suspicion grows that perhaps there was someone else involved in the grisly murders."
