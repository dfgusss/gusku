    "overview": "Egyptians Radu and Ma milk British tourists out of their money by offering phony tours of a mummy's tomb-- Radu has the girl lend her eyes to the \"mummy\" from inside an empty sarcophagus. When adventurer Wendland comes to visit the tomb, Ma is rescued and falls in love with him, leaving Radu in the dust. Needless to say, her former employer / captor follows them abroad in order to exact his revenge."
