    "overview": "Too much celebrating after scoring the year's biggest story leads to 24 missing hours in the life of photojournalist Aaron Doherty. Awakening in a wheat field with no memory of the previous day, Aaron struggles to account for the gap. Sent back in time when the phenomenon recurs, the progressively disoriented Aaron is left to untangle the vast political conspiracy that's behind it all."
