    "overview": "Professor Malcolm Evans leads his archaeological expedition into the Valley of Temples in southeast Sicily.  His companion and former student, Liza Harris, is looking forward to her very first dig.  But Liza feels a strange sympathy with the valley and her recurring nightmares seem strongly tied to the nearby ruins.  She is drawn to the remains of a 16th Century convent and its grisly legend of crucifixion.  The local villagers rise to protect the entombed secrets of their ancestors, as Liza's obsession with uncovering the truth takes her deeper into the forbidden ruins and further from sanity!"
