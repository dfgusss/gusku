    "overview": "In 1911-12, the Romanian movie director Grigore Brezianu and the financial tycoon Leon Popescu made together the 2 hours long movie \"Romania's Independence\" - an as faithful as possible screen adaptation of the real Independence War that had been fought in 1877. Now, \"Restul e tacere\" tells us, in a loose and half-fictionalized way, the story of this movie making."
