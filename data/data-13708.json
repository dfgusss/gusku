    "overview": "Mother Fitch (Julie Strain) and her girls have an insatiable taste for men; their flesh that is. The Delta Delta Pi sorority girls are not only the most popular and wealthy on campus, but also the most deadly. Now, as they prepare for their 20th anniversary homecoming, a meddlesome student has enlisted the help of DDP charter member Rhonda Cooper (Brinke). Together they attempt to end the sorority's reign of culinary terror that grips the California campus."
