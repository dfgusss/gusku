    "overview": "When smokeshow space teens Xena, Sola, and Luna steal Xena's dad's spaceship for an illicit joyride, they run out of gas and come crashing to Earth. There, they meet Dave and Jerry, two equally horny Earth dudes who are good to go and endless scenes of hot, silly, and sultry sex ensue. But when Dave's easy going Uncle Bud is targeted for eviction from his ramshackle beach house, the hormonal honeys must put their libidos aside and enter a bikini contest, the prize money of which will save the day."
