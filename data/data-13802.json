    "overview": "Loren doesn't like her new neighbor, Jared, or his vicious dog. Along with her friend Steven, Loren spies on Jared and begins to suspect he's a werewolf, responsible for a rash of disappearances. But Jared is watching her just as closely because Loren reminds him of his dead wife. As a full-moon night nears, Loren enlists the help of TV star Redd Tucker, who knows how to hunt -- and who believes her werewolf theory."
