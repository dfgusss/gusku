    "overview": "Early Errol Morris documentary intersplices random chatter he captured on film of the genuinely eccentric residents of Vernon, Florida. A few examples? The preacher giving a sermon on the definition of the word \"Therefore,\" and the obsessive turkey hunter who speaks reverentially of the \"gobblers\" he likes to track down and kill."
