Unfortunately, almost everyone around him is happy to see him gone.  Everyone, that is, except for his daughter Rosy, who still feels affection for her father even though they have drifted apart.  With her medical student boyfriend, Johnathan, Rosy will try to get to the bottom of her father's death."
