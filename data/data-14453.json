    "overview": "Tony Washington is killed in a hit-and-run after saving the local bodega clerk from robbers. Molly Mokembe is a Haitian voodou practitioner who brings him back as a zombi from a debt owed by Tony's late dad in an act of sacrifice that saved her. Jimbo, the kid that iced Tony, is embracing some new sadistic feelings. What follows is a revenge that can only be sated once all of those who were with Jimbo that night have had their due."
