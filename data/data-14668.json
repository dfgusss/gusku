    "overview": "Go behind the stage with the gothic/metal band Type O Negative. See hilarious tounge-in-cheek humor from all 4 members (also has footage of Sal Abruscato). Also see a huge toilet paper fight with the crowd as Pantera plays on stage. You thought these guys were dark and mysterious? Think again."
