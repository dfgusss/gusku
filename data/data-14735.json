    "overview": "Featuring one of the last public appearances by Keith Moon, the 1977 Kilburn show is a long-sought holy grail for fans of The Who, performing before a select audience on December 15, 1977 at Kilburn. Also included is a much earlier never-before-seen rarity and one of the band's personal favorites, The Who's powerhouse London Coliseum gig from 1969."
