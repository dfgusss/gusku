    "overview": "Dr. Harvey Wallinger is one of Nixon's aides who rises through the ranks to become the \"real\" power behind the president. This short was produced as a television special for PBS in 1971 and was scheduled to air in February 1972, but it was pulled from the schedule shortly before its airdate as PBS officials reportedly feared it might adversely affect their government funding. The special never aired, but it can now be viewed in The Paley Center for Media and has been widely bootlegged online."
