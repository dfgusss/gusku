    "overview": "The year is 2003, and the Private Çamlıca High School, once home to the legendary “Hababam Class”, is still in operation. The school’s founder has passed away, and his son, nicknamed “Mad Bedri,” now runs the place. The time-honored Hababam traditions continue in full force, and every teacher is so exasperated by the endless pranks of that class that they’re constantly looking for a way out. Seeing his chance, Mad Bedri plans to sell the school to a developer in exchange for floor space rights, so that it can be torn down and replaced with a high-rise office complex. When the principal, Fatoş, learns of his scheme, she enlists the help of the original “Hababam” alumni to save the school by taking on its current troublemakers. Tensions rise once Bedri announces the sale, and a huge surprise awaits everyone."
