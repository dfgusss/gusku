    "overview": "Symphony for the Devil was recorded Sunday August 22, 1999, at the 12th Bizarre Festival, Cologne, Germany. This gig was originally recorded for a German live-in-concert program, 'WDR Rockpalast', and broadcast on German television. The band bought the live footage because it seemed to be the best one available to date regardless of the previous TV releases. 12 cameras were used."
