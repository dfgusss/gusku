    "overview": "At the Gästhaus \"Den Hvide Hest\" in the Austrian Alps, romantic entanglements are in full swing. Waiter Leopold is in love with landlady Josepha, who has her eye on charming manufacturer Sigismund, who in turn hits on all women almost as a matter of principle. Klara and Lene also join the battle for the popular manufacturer, while waiter apprentice Mickey would rather just have a goat."
