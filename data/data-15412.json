    "overview": "\"A Guide to Sexual Dissatisfaction\" is a somewhat different cinematic experience. Perhaps it shouldn't even be called a film in the traditional sense, because what happens here in the cinema demands more from the audience than passive consumption. For the \"guide\" to work and unfold its full effect, the audience must participate."
