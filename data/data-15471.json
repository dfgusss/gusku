    "overview": "The Wolves baseball team gets steamed when they find they've been inherited by one K.C. Higgins, a suspected \"fathead\" who intends to take an active interest in running the team. But K.C. turns outs to be a beautiful woman who really knows her baseball. Second baseman Dennis Ryan promptly falls in love. But his playboy roommate Eddie O'Brien has his own notions about how to treat the new lady owner and some unsavory gamblers have their own ideas about how to handle Eddie."
