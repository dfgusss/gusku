    "overview": "Saturday, 12 p.m. The countdown has begun for four men on the make for women. Massage studios, last minute shopping, bodybuilding; our men ardently throw themselves into the ritual of appearance. It is impossible to resist the ferociously burlesque and remarkably stereotypical behavior of these characters. We will meet Gérard known as The Bull, Patrice known as The Lion, Jean-Jacques known as The Peacock and Serge known as The Earthworm. All of this is set in the clubs and bars of late night Montréal."
