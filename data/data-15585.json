    "overview": "A crew of Martians overhears a radio broadcast of Orson Welles' \"War of the Worlds\" coming from Earth, and, thinking the Martian fleet is attacking Earth, they land their broken-down ship in a backwater mid-American town. As luck would have it, they land on Halloween and get mistaken for trick-or-treaters. Comedy ensues as the Martians try to get taken seriously."
