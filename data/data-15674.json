    "overview": "A decade ago, curler Chris Cutter disappeared suddenly on the verge of stardom, dropping his curling stones to the bottom of a lake and leaving his fiancée, Julie Foley, at the altar. But when his former coach dies, Cutter returns home for the funeral and attempts to fulfill the man's last wishes. The team is reunited under Cutter's estranged dad, Gordon — himself a former curling star — for a final attempt at glory."
