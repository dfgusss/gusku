There are knights within the kingdoms and these knights who control giant robots, Mortar Heads, are called Headliners. Bound to the knights are fatimas. Human in appearance and mind, the fatimas (mostly female) possess expanded physical capabilities and make it possible for a Headliner to control a Mortar Head. Fatimas cannot reproduce. All this is overseen by Emperor Amaterasu and his Mirage Knights."
