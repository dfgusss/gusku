    "overview": "More than just a stand-up, the lovable Queen Of Mean is at it again...and no one is immune as Lisa takes off the gloves and delivers an unrelenting barrage of political incorrectness and 'shoot from the lip' observations. Never shy about engaging in controversy, she deftly navigates the social taboos, stereotypes, and cultural differences that even the boldest of today's comedians would rarely broach."
