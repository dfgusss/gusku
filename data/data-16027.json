    "overview": "An irreverent and refreshing take on the queer world of sex, lust and unrequited love. Lanky, blue haired Jackson, record store employee and poet, is in love with most of the men in his life! A refreshing departure from the typical gay love story, LUSTER is a raw and darkly comic look at young punks in love."
