    "overview": "In the lawless heart of the Old West, notorious outlaw Sam Phoenix stands at the gallows, moments from justice—or so it seems. But when an unearthly terror descends on the town without warning, everything changes. As chaos erupts and survival becomes the only law, Phoenix finds himself facing a threat far deadlier than any posse. Something not of this world has arrived… and it’s just getting started."
