    "overview": "According to Winnie-the-Pooh himself, bears love honey very much. That's why it always runs out very quickly. And you can't do without honey, so Winnie, along with Piglet, sets off for a tall tree with a beehive hanging from it.  Winnie fearlessly climbs up to the beehive on a balloon, singing a song about a little cloud."
