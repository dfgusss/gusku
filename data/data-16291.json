    "overview": "Term-time ends at Acme Looniversity and the Tiny Toon characters look forward to a summer filled with fun. Buster and Babs Bunny turn a water fight into a white-water rafting trip through the dangerous Deep South; Plucky Duck and Hamton Pig share the most impossibly awful car journey imaginable on the way to HappyWorldLand; Fifi's blind date becomes a \"skunknophobic\" nightmare; and a safari park is turned upside-down by Elmyra's search for \"cute little kitties to hug and squeeze\"."
