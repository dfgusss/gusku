    "overview": "Laguna was once a great soccer player whose career was interrupted by an injury. He spent years climbing the ranks to become an international referee. He sees the prevailing arrangements, manipulations, and bribery around him. Now desperate, he decides to stage an extraordinary culmination of his career: he wants to create a so-called \"miracle Sunday\" by \"printing\" the final round of games - taking substantial bribes from the interested clubs and manipulating the matches so that the results align in the order he set up."
