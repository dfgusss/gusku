    "overview": "When you're the city attorney you don't need the kinds of problems that her father was giving her. After her mother died, her father began doing his \"Santa Schtick,\" as she called it, much more intensely... which meant that he turned his home into a kind of year-round Santa Claus castle where children of all ages could come to see the wonderful presents and no child ever left without a gift."
