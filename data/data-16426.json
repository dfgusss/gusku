    "overview": "Leopold Wallisch, nick-named \"Lemming\", was fired from the homicide department due to intrigues by his colleague Krotznig. Now he works for a small Viennese private detective agency and spies on potential adulterers. When the Latin teacher Grinzinger is murdered while under Lemming's observation, he gives himself a shove and decides to solve the case himself. \"Lemming's First Case\", an adaptation of the best-seller by the Austrian author Stefan Slupetzky, promises pure crime comedy."
