    "overview": "Australia's hottest children's band presents another full-length video that's bursting with great music, amusing antics, and a fanciful story. Two mischievous \"Wiggly Gremlins\" have singled out the Wiggles and their own \"Network Wiggles\" television studio for some serious mischief in Whoo Hoo! Wiggly Gremlins. When the big red car breaks down on the way to the studio, Jeff, Murray, Greg, and Anthony have to get out and push. Meanwhile, Captain Feathersword finds leading the preparations for broadcast at the television studio unduly difficult--and most perplexing. After a truly wacky day, the Gremlins are discovered and the Wiggles' world returns to \"normal.\" Ten catchy songs like \"Dressing Up\" and \"Lights, Camera, Action\" punctuate the events of the day, and there are lots of fun antics, colorful sets, crazy costumes, and even a glimpse into some of the magical tricks of television. This presentation offers a nice blend of story and song and is sure to captivate children ages 1 to 7."
