    "overview": "For the first time Karl Lagerfeld has agreed to let someone create an artwork on his every day life and to trust in the director.

After three years of work, and over three hundred hours of footage, Rodolphe Marconi discloses the daily life of the star through his personal lens as a filmmaker."
