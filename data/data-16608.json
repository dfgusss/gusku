    "overview": "Adventures of the \"How to Rip Whale Tooth\" (1977) heroes continue... The story takes place in the countryside, where little Vashko's dad takes him and his mother, and where another surprise awaits them: not only an excellent holiday in the setting of a rock town, but also the figure of a grandfather, understanding all the dangerous beliefs in the turbulent surface of the renewed relationship of the three closest people. Vasek's other wish comes true - his dad teaches him the secrets of rock climbing. This shared passion, however, causes further conflicts between the two parents - much to the chagrin of both Vasek and his grandfather."
