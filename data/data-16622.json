    "overview": "The Emperor's mismanagement of his country is provoking some in his court to plot to overthrow him.  He feels successful, at least, when he discovers the legendary Golem, which he believes can protect him and even cure his imaginary illnesses but, when he disappears while on a bender, his kindly baker, who looks just like him, is mistaken for him, and begins to put things in order.  However, the conspirators, not to be outdone, determine to bring the Golem back to life to do their bidding."
