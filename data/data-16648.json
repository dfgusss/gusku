    "overview": "Television's \"King of Queens\" reigns again in this Comedy Central special -- the network's first-ever hour-long show devoted entirely to one comic, taped live in July 2001 at New York City's Hudson Theatre. James riffs on life's many \"royal\" pains, including waiting in line with strangers, negotiating with the airport ticket counter clerk, underwear wedgies, boringly slow answering machine messages and more."
