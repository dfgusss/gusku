    "overview": "Koizumi Risa an unusually tall high school girl, meets the \"vertically challenged\" young man Otani Atsushi. They find common ground in height anxieties and interests. Risa, a tall Japanese girl, gets rejected by a boy because she is taller than him. Otani, a short Japanese guy, gets rejected by a girl because he is shorter than her. Obviously these two would make the oddest of couples and would never be a good match for each other right?"
