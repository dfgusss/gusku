    "overview": "Comedy Central Roast regular Greg Giraldo isn't shy about tearing into his fellow funnymen (and women) at the network's frequent specials, and he turns his wicked wit to a variety of topics in this live show. In Midlife Vices, Giraldo extols the virtues of drinking in your 40s, praises New York's Puerto Rican Day Parade, questions Barack Obama's smoking habit, and leaves no comic target unscathed."
