    "overview": "Although it sounds good in theory, the miracle of becoming the Son of the Sun doesn't in practice turn out the way Fikri Şemsigil expects. His whole life depends on this one \"big\" day, but the consequences of this miracle disappoint Fikri as his life is turned upside down. To rid himself of this so-called miracle, Fikri decides to explore its source but there's still the big problem with the woman in the building across the street!"
