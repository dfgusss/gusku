    "overview": "3,2,1..Blast off with The Wiggles® to outer space! The popular Aussies are more animated than usual when they discover what they look like in Jeff's dreams. It's an out-of-this-world experience when a spaceship with aliens lands nearby. Captain Feathersword launches The Wiggles light-years from home to Planet Rock Star, where they join King Mondo for some rockin and rollin and wigglin! Teeny Weeny Land is their next stop in the galaxy where they dance a jig with their tiny extraterrestrial friends. Next, their rocket zooms through space to Gloomy World, where their wiggly humor cheers up the Gloomies. Final destination? Home to Wiggle House of course!"
