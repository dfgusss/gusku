    "overview": "Trey is a young deliveryman who can't seem to catch a break. His whole life is a shambles - no money for college and no game to attract the ladies. After a failed attempt to get together with the girl of his dreams, Trey gets caught up by a seductive older woman who pays for his \"personal delivery services.\" He's having the time of his life - at first, but this deceptively ideal situation soon sends his life spinning out of control!"
