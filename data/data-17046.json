    "overview": "When a group of friends and colleagues tracks reclusive writer Samantha Ballard (Aleece Jones) to her remote desert house, their reluctant hostess informs them that they'll die if they try to escape. After her ex-husband disastrously tests Samantha's pledge, the remaining guests sink into horror. If they want to leave Fear House alive, this desperate group must act fast in writer-director Michael R. Morris's claustrophobic spook fest."
