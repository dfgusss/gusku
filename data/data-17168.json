So, he sets up an ad hoc gang with his close friends in order to rob a bank. The operation, however, is crowned by complete failure. Actually, Babis used Leonidas to create a diversion in order to rob a jeweler's shop. Leonidas flies into a rage and swears to take revenge on the \"teacher\". The scuffle that follows results in all of them ending up in hospital."
