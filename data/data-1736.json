    "overview": "It's 1957, and James Whale's heyday as the director of \"Frankenstein,\" \"Bride of Frankenstein\" and \"The Invisible Man\" is long behind him. Retired and a semi-recluse, he lives his days accompanied only by images from his past. When his dour housekeeper, Hannah, hires a handsome young gardener, the flamboyant director and simple yard man develop an unlikely friendship, which will change them forever."
