    "overview": "Late 19th century in Alexandria. Two traditionally rival Turkish families, \"Seferoglu\"s and \"Tellioglu\"s are competing for the \"Green Valley\". The winner will be determined by Daver Bey, who has a beautiful young daughter, Leyla. Both families try to arrange a marriage between a man from their family and Leyla, so that Daver Bey will be inclined to give the green valley to his \"relatives\". Tellioglus, who are behind in the race, desperately find a final solution: They will fake their idiotic butler, Saban, as the highest ranked Ottoman soldier in Egypt: Tosun Pasha."
