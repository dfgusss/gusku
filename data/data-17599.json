    "overview": "The first story-time segment is about a cheerful cockroach named Don, who scurries throughout his mansion home, walks beneath the floorboards and does unspeakable things in the darkness of the cupboard, before being splatted by somebody's foot. The second segment is about an ordinary man named Albert Einstein (\"the only Albert Einstein not to have discovered the Theory of Relativity\") whose hands have a life of their own, staying out late at night, misbehaving and committing adultery with feet. The third segment – hasn't much story to it at all, and instead concerns the inhabitants of the moving pictures on an over-sized Christmas card, who interact with each other in all sorts of bizarre ways."
