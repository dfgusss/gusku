Mrs. Kolęda is an energetic community leader, her husband, a gentle soul, takes care of raising ducks and cultivating flowers in \"tunnels\" at home. Their daughter, Dorota, is a pretty and unemployed young woman. The intrigue begins when the community leader finds out that she is going to become a grandmother. Fear of losing authority, scandal, and embarrassment inspires her to come up with a truly diabolical idea - they need to buy a fiancé for Dorota with a pre-arranged divorce."
