    "overview": "The teenage siblings know that no one will give them a life more interesting than vegetating in a gloomy hole. They take matters into their own hands and organize a bank robbery, because money is their ticket to a better world. Everything was supposed to go smoothly, but then that fatal bad luck struck... Cop 1 isn't so bad: he keeps his wife in line because he loves her, he drinks because he's lost, he takes bribes because he needs money for booze. Cop 2 isn't bad either, he just supports Cop 1, who's in trouble, spiritually. Soon, the paths of the cops and thieves will cross..."
