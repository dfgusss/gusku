    "overview": "A comic study of 20th century history, reconstructing the life of one Tulse Luper, a writer, project-maker and professional prisoner. He was born in 1911 in Newport, Wales and last heard of in 1989. The story of his life is here pieced together from the evidence found in 92 suitcases scattered around the world. In the second of three parts, we follow Tulse Luper as he works in a cinema, which gives him ample opportunity to cross paths with virtually every artistic device and dramatic character known to man."
