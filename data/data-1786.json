He was born in 1911 in Newport, Wales and last heard of in 1989. The story of his life is here pieced together from the evidence found in 92 suitcases scattered around the world. In the third of three parts, we follow Tulse Luper as he continues his adventures as a professional prisoner during the later years of the Second World War and the Cold War."
