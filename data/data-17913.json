    "overview": "McCord's gang robs the stage carrying money to pay Indians for their land, and the notorious outlaw \"The Oklahoma Kid\" Jim Kincaid takes the money from McCord. McCord stakes a \"sooner\" claim on land which is to be used for a new town; in exchange for giving it up, he gets control of gambling and saloons. When Kincaid's father runs for mayor, McCord incites a mob to lynch the old man whom McCord has already framed for murder."
