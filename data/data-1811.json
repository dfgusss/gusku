    "overview": "Young Victor Frankenstein, a cold, arrogant and womanizing genius, is angry when his father Alphonse forbids him to continue his anatomy experiments. He ruthlessly murders Alphonse by sabotaging his shotgun, consequently inheriting the title of Baron von Frankenstein and the family fortune. He uses the money to enter medical school in Vienna, but is forced to return home following an affair with the daughter of the schools Dean.  Returning to his own castle, Victor sets up a laboratory and starts a series of experiments involving the revival of the dead. He eventually builds a composite body from human parts, which he then brings to life. The creature goes on a homicidal rampage until it is accidentally destroyed when a little girl accidentally causes the vat in which it has been hidden to be flooded with acid, leaving behind only the creature's shoes floating on the surface."
