    "overview": "Happy couple Jason and Alexandra lose their sail yacht in a storm and are grateful to get picked up by Captain Jim Bigelow's commercial carrier. Suspicious about the ship's doctor and realizing the ship is improbably empty and the radio not broken as the crew claims, Jason starts snooping around.  Bodies on meat-hooks, genetic experimentation and giant spiders are what he finds."
