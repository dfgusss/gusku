    "overview": "The story of the making of this remarkable album is told here via exclusive interviews with band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett and Jason Newsted, archive footage and performance, and contributions from producer Bob Rock. We revisit the original multi-tracks of the album, as well as listen to previously unheard demo recordings. Featuring the five singles from the album, Enter Sandman, Sad But True, \"The Unforgiven\", \"Wherever I May Roam\" and \"Nothing Else Matters\", this is the compelling story of one of the biggest selling albums of all time, a true Classic Album."
