    "overview": "It is happening all across America-rural landowners wake up one day to find a lucrative offer from an energy company wanting to lease their property. Reason? The company hopes to tap into a reservoir dubbed the \"Saudi Arabia of natural gas.\" Halliburton developed a way to get the gas out of the ground-a hydraulic drilling process called \"fracking\"-and suddenly America finds itself on the precipice of becoming an energy superpower."
