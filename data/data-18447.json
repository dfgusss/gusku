    "overview": "Camp Sasquatch will be bought out and closed unless owner Coach Giddy wins the boxing competition scheduled for the end of the summer. Tough city punk Flash, who's performing his community service time at the camp, is the coach's best hope. Flash reluctantly offers to help and so must use his raw sparring talents to get a motley group of adolescent misfits into fighting shape, while also trying to win the heart of pretty Cheryl."
