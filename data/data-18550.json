    "overview": "Neil Young's \"musical novel\", telling the story of a family, the murder of a cop and the evolution of a young girl named Sun Green. This is not a concert film. Young himself shot actors on locations on his native Northern California home turf to create his Greendale, a rural town that is a microcosm of a world in crisis. There is lots of music featured by Young and Crazy Horse. Special bonus features include \"Making of\" with brand new interviews with Neil and the cast; also 3 live performances of \"Greendale\" songs, more."
