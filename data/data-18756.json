    "overview": "A team of Navy Seals are sent to destroy a disabled submarine so it will not fall into the \"wrong\" hands. They complete their mission, but are captured before they can return to their base. The U.S. Government will not mount a rescue mission to free the soldiers, so their teenage children take over. The kids find a way to venture into the foreign country and then must overcome many obstacles."
