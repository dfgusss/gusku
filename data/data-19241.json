    "overview": "This is the story loosely based on Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed, who introduced rock'n'roll to teenage American radio audiences in the 1950s. Freed was a source of great controversy: criticized by conservatives for corrupting youth with the \"devil's music\"; hated by racists for promoting African American music for white consumption; persecuted by law enforcement officials and finally brought down by the \"payola\" scandals."
