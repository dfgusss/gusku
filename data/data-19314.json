    "overview": "The Pope is disturbed by the fact that today's youth are not as spiritually inclined as they should be, and so he decides to set up a Vatican television station and entice them back into the religion of their ancestors. In order to particularly grab the wandering flock, a priest invites the comedians from \"The Other Sunday,\" an actual comedy program on Italian television, to perform on this new channel."
