    "overview": "Emile de Antonio's film decimates Richard Nixon and exposes him as a paranoid, power mad lunatic... de Antonio compiles (via video and film) what amounts to the \"best of\" one of the worst political figures of the 20th century. Nixon was a shameless self-promoter while trying desperately to convince everyone that he wasn't. Through Alger Hiss and the \"Checkers\" speech to the character assassination of Helen Gahagan Douglas (among others), there are few stones left unturned."
