    "overview": "Tenue De Soirée (1986) is a dark comedy by Bertrand Blier starring Gérard Depardieu, Michel Blanc, and Miou-Miou. Antoine and Monique, a poor couple living in a caravan, meet Bob, a charismatic burglar who leads them into a series of thefts and a troubled relationship. Bob expresses a desire for Antoine, disrupting the trio's romantic and power relationships. The film provocatively addresses themes of sexuality, cross-dressing, and power relations. A critical and popular success, it earned Michel Blanc the Best Actor Award at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival."
