    "overview": "The Skull [from a short story by Robert Bloch, author of Psycho] is a fearsome, finely acted and moody tale of Gothic horror. The 150 year old skull of the Marquis de Sade has been taken from its grave, bringing terror to those who own it. Demonologist Christopher Maitland [Peter Cushing] is eager to add the piece to his occult collection. Despite the warnings of a friend [Christopher Lee], he's got to have it. And does he ever get it."
