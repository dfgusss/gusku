    "overview": "Every Monday evening, at the arena, eleven men get together to lovingly put on the jersey of the Boys, the hockey team of a \"garage\" league to which they belong.  As Stan, their revered trainer, would affectionately say, they have the \"puck\" tattooed on their hearts. It doesn't matter if they are lawyers, policemen, mechanics or unemployed, as soon as they enter the locker room, everyone forgets their age, their work and their problems."
