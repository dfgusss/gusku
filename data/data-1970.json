    "overview": "Achim, a risk-taking young shipowner, and Willi, an inventive bon vivant, collide in the Swiss Alps. The accident alone reveals the rifts that lie between their worlds. Only Sven, the peace-loving bank employee from Sylt, who takes them both in at his vacation cabin, manages to broker a truce with cheese and wine. However, by an unfortunate coincidence, Sven dies at a happy moment. Now Achim and Willi have a problem: what to do with the body? Before his death, Sven told them all sorts of things: about his boss at the bank and fresh bread rolls, a lot of black money and the key to it. While Germany is in the grip of World Cup fever, Achim and Willi travel with Sven's body from the Swiss Alps to the North Sea. On Sylt, the dead man is supposed to wave to his boss one last time before being buried at his elbow as requested. But there's a catch: black money doesn't stink, but Sven does!"
