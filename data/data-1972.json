    "overview": "Not only must Blondie put on a brave face when her husband Dagwood is fired for the umpteenth time by Mr. Dithers, but she must also tolerate the attention paid to Dagwood by pretty WAC Mary Jane McDermott.  A whiz in business matters, Mary Jane sets up Dag in his own business, which replenishes the Bumstead coffers but which drives Blondie into a jealous frenzy."
