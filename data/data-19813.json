Tensions and passions spin out of control after two agents are left for dead and they must combine forces to survive. They have one chance laft to take out the General and destroy the \"Apocalypse in a can\" nerve agent, both speeding toward freedom on a runaway mountain train. Unexpected twists and terrifying turns along the way put everyone on a collision course for explosive action, pulse-pounding thrill and a devastating betrayal of trust."
