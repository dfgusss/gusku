Poor old Dagwood manages to gum things up when he falls for a confidence scam engineered by the duplicitous Toby Clifton.  He even finds himself in a compromising position that seriously endangers his future connubial happiness with his wife Blondie. Once again, it's up to Blondie to straighten out the mess."
