    "overview": "Confronted with the unfortunate news that their favorite Streetcar, no. 133, is going to be decommissioned, two Municipal Transit workers get drunk and decide to \"take 'er for one last spin,\" as it were. Unfortunately, the \"one last spin\" ends up being an all-night and all-day scramble to stay out of trouble, as they are confronted with situation after sometimes bizarre situation that prevents them from returning the \"borrowed\" Streetcar!"
