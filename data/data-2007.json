    "overview": "In 1662, ten years after the Fronde, King Louis XIV, then aged 24, was still feeling the insult. When the name of Baron de Fargues came to his ears, the king unleashed a blind vengeance against this amnestied former rebel. But Louise de La Vallière, Louis XIV's mistress, could jeopardize the plan."
