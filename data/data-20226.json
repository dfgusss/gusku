    "overview": "In 1970s Britain, 18-year old Dean feels hampered by his working-class background and his family. In order to make something of himself, he assumes another identity and manages to enter high society.  Uses a unique projection technique that displays three side-by-side frames of nearly simultaneous action, giving the impression of simultaneous events, rather than a multi-camera recording. This innovative \"three-camera\" or triple-image effect was an \"almost innovation\" for the time, offering a novel cinematic experience alongside the film's compelling story and strong direction."
