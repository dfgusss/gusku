    "overview": "Anthropologist Dr. Brockton unearths a primitive troglodyte -- an Ice Age \"missing link\": half-caveman, half-ape -- in a local cave. Through medical experimentation, she manages to communicate with him and domesticate him before he's let loose by an irate land developer and goes on a rampage, terrorizing the local citizenry."
