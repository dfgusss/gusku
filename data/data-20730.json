    "overview": "When the Chilean officials lift the ban on harvesting the shellfish \"el loco\" (which purportedly is an aphrodisiac) in the seaside village of Puerto Gala greed and lust take hold. Greed is embodied by Carlos Maldonato, \"El Canuto,\" who attempts to buy all of the shellfish for a Japanese company, and by a traveling band of prostitutes that accompany the influx of fishermen. El Canuto also wrangles to get into good stead with an old flame, Sonia, who is now the proprietor of \"La Pincoya,\" a local restaurant. But \"el loco\" proves more effective, and more damaging, than anyone could have guessed."
