    "overview": "Trouble seems to find Ray Perso, or maybe he just looks for it. First he's busted for hacking Manhattan's ATM banking system - sending twenties flying on every street corner. Then he's sprung from the Computer Rehab by a Russian gangster and smuggled to Moscow to work for an imprisoned \"businessman\". Maneuvering his way through the chaotic and violent Moscow Underworld, Ray finds love. But, his bliss is short-lived when he finds out someone has 40 million reasons to want him dead!"
