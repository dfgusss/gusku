    "overview": "Florence Denny is Tommy Nelson's girlfriend and secretary at a clothing manufacturer during the Great Depression. In order to boost sales they have been using professional female entertainers to keep their clients very happy, but the clients are getting bored of them. Tommy convinces management to replace the professionals with \"volunteers\" from the pool of stenographers. Inevitably some clients expectations are greater than their \"dates\", boyfriends become unhappy, and the \"voluntary\" duty becomes less so over time.  At first, Tommy prevents Florence from being a volunteer, but eventually the prospect of a bonus becomes too great and he encourages her to volunteer. Afterwards, Tommy considers Florence a loose woman."
