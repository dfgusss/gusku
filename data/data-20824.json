    "overview": "The Office of Scientific Investigations tracks down the source of increased magnetism and radioactivity in Los Angeles, and discovers that a man-made isotope is consuming available energy from nearby mass every few hours,  doubling its size in the process.  Although microscopic, it will soon become big enough to destroy Earth; and how to stop it is yet to be determined.  The film's Deltatron special effects footage is taken from the 1934 German sci-fi film GOLD."
