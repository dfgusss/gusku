    "overview": "Carolinian Blake Beckett (Pepper Sweeney), the son of a stock car racing legend, is a 4-time short track racing champion. Blake never made it to the speedways of the National Cup Racing circuit, but surely he could still have a shot? The daily life experiences of Blake's family and crew are exposed through unique characters that work and play through the weeks that culminate in 120 mph Saturday nights."
