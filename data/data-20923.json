    "overview": "In Paris, Ariane and Lena are sisters. Ariane writes photo novellas for the magazine \"Toi et Moi.\" She's emotional and her long-time boyfriend, Farid, has her in a state because he won't propose, won't ask her to live with him, and often is unavailable. Lena is a cellist, quiet and circumspect in life and in her playing. She lives without passion with her boyfriend François; they're talking about having a baby."
