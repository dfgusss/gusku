    "overview": "Part of a series of opera shorts by different directors. Herzog combines O Soave Fanciulla (\"Oh you vision of beauty\" from Puccini's La Boheme) with images of harsh life in Africa.  The varied body of work was produced to celebrate six years of Sky Arts' season sponsorship of ENO and both organisations' commitment to widening the appeal of opera. Set to recordings by ENO Orchestra conducted by ENO Music Director Edward Gardner, they feature singers Peter Auty, Geraint Dodd, Mary Plazas and Mark Stone."
