    "overview": "A satire on war and on the stupid things war inspires people to do. Four young men enter an abandoned fortress. Inside, they find military uniforms, which they immediately resolve to use to stage a bizarre war game. Their actions appear all the more senseless in relation to the peaceful everyday reality of the workers in the surrounding countryside."
