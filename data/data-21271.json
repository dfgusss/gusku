    "overview": "Things haven't been going well for Steve 'The Wog Boy' Karamitsis. His one true love—a '69 Valiant Pacer—and all his assets have just been seized by Federal Police because he trusted the shady Tony the Yugoslav, and Steve's best mate Frank has lost his touch with the ladies after a messy divorce. But fortune favours the 'Wog' when Steve discovers that he's inherited a beach on the Greek resort island of Mykonos from an uncle he never met—a beach worth millions."
