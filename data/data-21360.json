The natives are hostile, and take him prisoner until he begins to sing for them and a little boy named Pedro recognizes his voice. They release Basara, and almost as soon as they don, a strange wailing voice comes from the nearby mountains. Basara and Pedro head out in Basara's valkyrie to investigate the noise. Little do they know, an ambush is waiting for them."
