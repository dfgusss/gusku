    "overview": "Called \"the longest running con in FBI history,\" Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, the man that people knew as \"Clark Rockefeller\" had brilliantly impersonated numerous people, ranging from a talk show host to a Pentagon Advisor before ultimately claiming to be an heir to the famous Rockefeller family. Confident from the success of his prior scams, Clark quickly became well known and highly respected among Boston's elite and used his purported high society status to charm his way into the life of Sandra Boss, a millionaire with a Harvard MBA and a partner at the prestigious management consulting firm, McKinsey &amp; Company."
