However, the family’s experiments have now gone wrong, and the stocking-clad women have now become ravenous ZOMBIES! Now trapped, our ragtag group of visitors must unite in a desperate bid to stay alive… Sexy, gory and gut-munchingly hilarious – ZOMBIE WOMEN OF SATAN is THE most outrageous zombie comedy movie of the year!"
