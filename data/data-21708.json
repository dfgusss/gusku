    "overview": "Fiona is abandoned at six months of age, raised in foster and adoptive homes, abused, and, still a teen, hustles on the streets of New York.  We watch her use heroine, fall in love with other women, be pursued by men, engage in murderous violence, hide out in a crack house, and decide to leave the city.  We see her mother, also a streetwalker and drug user, occasionally talk about her lost daughter.  Fiona has a necklace she was clutching when a foundling. Will mother and daughter meet? Is there a silver lining?"
