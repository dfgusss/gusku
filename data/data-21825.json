    "overview": "The story begins at the end of the first Kako movie. The survivors meet up with a group of other barricaded survivors and must take care of the zombies as well as other random Greeks that have taken advantage of the chaos, while shooting random moving targets (zombie or not). Throughout we take small flashback visits into ancient Greece where the zombie apocalypse has also happened and we learn how they faced them."
