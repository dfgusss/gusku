Jack Crawford wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism.  Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out."
