    "overview": "Massimo Castaldi is a social climber married to Violante who comes from a rich family. His relationship with his mistress Laura is jeopardised when the family moves to their summer house on the Pugliese coast. Nevertheless, Massimo seems to find a solution. His raunchy daughter Sonia failed in Italian and he plans to present Laura as a nun who will give Sonia private lessons for her compensation exam. On the other hand, there are two dim-witted criminals, Terenzio and Fulgenzio, who are planning to abduct a Castaldi family member for good ransom money."
