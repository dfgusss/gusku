    "overview": "Edgar organizes a salon on the topic of sexuality and arranges to use the lavish estate of Faldo as a venue. In light of the overwhelming brilliance of the luminaries in attendance, Edgar secures two comely stenographers to transcribe their intellectual discussion. But, as the conversation unfolds, the stenographers find it increasingly difficult to remain casual observers."
