With no body to speak of, reported 'sightings' of Peter, and revelations Joanne had cheated on her boyfriend, the public and media in both Britain and Australia refused to accept Joanne's innocence on face value. This is the story of one young woman's courage in the face of one of the most mysterious crimes in Australian history."
