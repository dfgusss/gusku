Jack must attempt to find his way home from the other-dimensional world of Orpheus, where magic works and the trancers were the ruling class (before Trancers IV, that is). Unfortunately, Jack's quest to find the mystical Tiamond in the Castle of Unrelenting Terror may be thwarted by the return of Caliban, king of the trancers who was thought dead."
