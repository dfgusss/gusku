    "overview": "Margaret Fish is planning a surprise party for her dentist husband, Bob. Meanwhile, at the office, Bob is having a mid-life crisis while insects munch on what's left of his plants. When Bob returns home, Margaret has a terrible time getting him into the room where everyone's hidden until he's halfway through changing clothes and talking about how horrid all their nebbishy friends are (the same friends hidden all over the room)."
