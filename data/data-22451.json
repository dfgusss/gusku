    "overview": "Danny Foster doesn't have much: an apartment as small as his paychecks, no family, and a struggling music career. Yet for him, \"every day is a great day to be alive,\" an attitude he gained from his mother's unwavering optimism during her losing battle with cancer. It's love at first sight when Danny meets Ariana, a wealthy girl from Greenwich, CT who tragically cannot hear the music she inspires him to write. Ariana, hearing impaired since childhood, is torn between hanging onto the shelter her controlling mother provides and fighting for a love that, if given the chance, might just change her life"
