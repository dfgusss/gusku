    "overview": "Saturnin is a servant who becomes his master's master. A young man of good social standing and upbringing, somewhat conservative, acquires, through no fault of his own, a servant named Saturnin. Saturnin effectively becomes his employer's master and causes a series of surprising twists and situations in his previously peaceful life. Without Saturnin, these would be difficult to manage. If only because without him, they would probably never have happened."
