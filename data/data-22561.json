    "overview": "The wickedly funny story of three sisters' coming of age in a wildly dysfunctional family, set against the backdrop of the 60's, free love, the Cold War, LSD and the dawn of feminism. Affectionately dubbed \"Little Women on acid\", this is a story about the destructive effects of secrecy and the bonds of duty between parents and their children."
