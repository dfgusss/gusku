    "overview": "Cannibal is based on the true-crime story of Armin Meiwes, the \"Rotenburg Cannibal\" who posted an online ad searching for someone to volunteer to be mutilated and eaten. Unlikely as it may seem, someone actually replied. The film shows a fictional portrayal of the meeting between the cannibal and his victim/participant, their homosexual relationship, and the eventual mutilation and murder of said victim."
