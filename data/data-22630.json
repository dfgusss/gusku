    "overview": "Soula Sarimbuyuki is 30 years old, independent, and against marriage. She grew up with her three aunts, who are originally from the city and love spicy food. Today is her birthday and birthdays are a very dangerous day! Like New Year's! You have to make decisions. She has just received four marriage proposals and decides to get married! Her three aunts are impressed, her two best friends run to help and the four prospective grooms arrive on the island to choose the right one. The test begins and the situation becomes complicated. While the winner is ready to \"pay\" the bride, Soula decides that a wedding is not a game show."
