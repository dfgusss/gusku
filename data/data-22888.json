    "overview": "A tale set in a decaying Parisian porn theatre, where within its dark confines, male patrons -- soldiers, transvestites, married men -- regularly engage in anonymous sex acts. In the ticket booth of the theatre, a wise Italian woman serves as benevolent gatekeeper, observing -- but never judging -- the proceedings occurring under her watchful eyes. One day, one of her regulars engages her in a conversation that leads to an unusual friendship, as these two worldly souls share their common experiences."
