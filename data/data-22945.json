    "overview": "The Beach Babes are back... and better than ever! Attempting to return to their home planet, Xena, once again, crash lands the T-Bird ship - this time on a primitive island full of naughty nubile natives. Chased by rampaging dinosaurs and pursued by the evil megalomaniac, James T. Renford II, and his wise-cracking sidekick, Gund, the stranded space sirens have the island rockin'. In an effort to help out the hot heroines, one of the girl's pumped-up playmates rewires Renford's computers which accidentally sets off a chain reaction that will cause the island to explode in an ultimate cosmic climax!"
