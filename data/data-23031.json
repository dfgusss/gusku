He's got a permanent job as a teacher, and has calmed down his life, enjoying the domestic bliss with his new girlfriend Karin, but the idyll doesn't last long. Veum gets a brutal meeting with the past, when \"The Knife\" is released from prison, determined to take revenge on those who got him convicted for the murder of a teenage girl."
