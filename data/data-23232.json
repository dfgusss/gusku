If there's one thing Brittany Sears can't stand, it's going fast. When Hornero Martino and his thuggish son Rico begin preying on Brittany's friends, however, the girl who spent her whole life in the slow land finally finds the courage to put the peddle to the metal thanks to her fast-driving boyfriend Max Spears. With little time to lose before the Martinos pull out their secret weapon, Brittany, Max, and fearsome fighter Zendo all set out save the day and rescue their pals."
