    "overview": "Is The Fjord Witch superstition, or is it true that Satan's bride lives across Melkelva in the forest by Grytefjord? Does Tordenskjold find himself or someone else entirely? Who would win in a magic battle between Jesus and Harry Potter? These and other questions are answered in Kurt Josef Wagle's lost video footage."
