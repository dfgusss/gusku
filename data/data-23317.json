    "overview": "Greed, lust and fate bring together a motley collection of oddballs and lowlifes for some rather sticky situations in Hoch's twisted neo-noir debut. Three separate but interconnected stories, all set on a deceptively sunny day in California and centered around one million dollars in cash, inspire Hoch's quirky characters to commit acts both devious and depraved in an attempt to make the big score."
