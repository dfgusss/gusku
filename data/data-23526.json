    "overview": "In the cramped, cluttered confines of Shopsin’s, a legendary hole-in-the-wall diner in New York’s Greenwich Village, eccentric chef Kenny Shopsin holds court—serving up an absurdly massive menu alongside his razor-sharp wit and unfiltered philosophies on life, food, and human nature. As the family-run institution faces a forced relocation, this intimate documentary captures the controlled chaos of Kenny’s world, where every customer is a character and every meal is a performance. A love letter to stubborn individuality and the art of doing things your own way."
