His co-worker, Murph, a generation older than Paul, is dealing with his own issues, chiefly the the impending death of his very ill gay son. After the men have a run-in with local snob Frederickson, Murph's age and experience starts to temper Paul's fiery nature, as the younger man begins to embrace his new life."
