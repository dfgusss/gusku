    "overview": "Outwardly, Lam takes pride in his job teaching Chinese literature at an elite school and in his caring wife and two sons. But deep down, the forty-year-old wrestles with unfulfilled desires stoked by jealousy over his friends’ professional successes and the advances of a flirtatious student. The sudden return of his former mentor finally upsets this delicate balance, forcing Lam to unearth the long-hidden truth about who he is and gain a new perspective on how to live the rest of his life."
