    "overview": "Teenage groupie Dorothy is riding with a rock band when, suddenly, the van runs off the road, and she hits her head. She awakes in a fantasy world as gritty and realistic as her own and learns that her arrival killed a young thug. A gay clothier, Glyn the Good Fairy, gives her a pair of red heels as a reward to help her see the last concert of the Wizard, an androgynous glam rock star. As she's pursued and sexually threatened by the late thug's brother, she encounters and befriends a brainless surfer, a heartless mechanic, and a cowardly biker."
