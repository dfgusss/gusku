    "overview": "Robert works as a gamedev in Hamburg and, together with his team, which includes his best friend and flatmate Ole and his girlfriend Lorna, is on the verge of completing an innovative first-person shooter. Before the Chinese businessmen arrive, Robert goes to the nearby sausage stand with Ole and messes up his gray suit with ketchup. On the spur of the moment, he goes to a nearby dry cleaner and asks the ladies working there for quick help. Normally he would have to wait a day, but Monika promises to clean the suit within two hours. Robert's reaction seems a little strange, but no one can yet suspect that he has just fallen head over heels in love with the attractive woman in her mid-forties."
