    "overview": "Coke Ennyday, the scientific detective, divides his time into periods of \"Sleep\", \"Eat\", \"Dope\" and \"Drinks\". In fact, he overcomes every situation with drugs: consuming cocaine to increase his energy or injecting it in his opponents to incapacitate them. To help the police, he tracks down a contraband of opium (which he eagerly tastes) transported within \"leaping fishes\", saving a \"fish-blower\" girl from blackmail along the way."
