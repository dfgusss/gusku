    "overview": "Imdat is a poor, uneducated, working class window cleaner who has migrated to the big city. As he cleans the windows of the private TV channel Kanal I, the president of the channel, Berk, discovers that Imdat has an uncanny ability to sense what program will yield the best ratings and what is likely to be panned by audiences, thus Berk begins milking Imdat's unique ability to score ratings. Soon Imdat finds himself replacing the president and leading the TV channel. He goes on to produce some truly tasteless and exploitative programs that enjoy massive ratings, eventually becoming part of the dirty media games himself."
