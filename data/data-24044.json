    "overview": "Become an eyewitness to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. This stirring 2-hour film will bring the Founding Fathers to life as you witness the struggles and the miracles that produced the Constitution of the United States and the freest nation on earth. Filmed on location at Independence Hall; Williamsburg, Virginia; and other historical sites, it dramatically chronicles how America became a nation. It is exciting drama of the best kind-fact, rather than fiction. \"It brings the history books to life,\" writes one reviewer. \"Dramatically moving, and visually handsome,\" says another. Officially recognized by the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution, who cited the film as being \"of exceptional merit.\""
