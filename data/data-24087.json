    "overview": "Shooters is a drama documentary film, directed by Dan Reed for Suspect Device Films. The film is set in Liverpool and used local criminals as actors depicting the lives of local 'gangsters'. It is most notable for having been completely unscripted apart from a brief outline; each scene was improvised and ad-libbed by the actors themselves."
