    "overview": "Pete is very inconspicuous at school, unlike his extrovert mate Cleatis who's happy to don a chicken suit and be the school mascot, but unfortunately, Cleatis is allergic to the suit. When there's an uproar at the chicken's disappearance, Pete is forced into the limelight as the school's basketball reputation is at stake."
