    "overview": "The military anti-terrorist army takes control of \"Chuspi\", an unknown and faraway small village, isolated by the terrorist group \"Sendero Luminoso\" (Shining Path). A soldier called Vitin Luna, and other young soldiers face an invisible, perhaps superior force. Their unit is commanded by a brutal lieutenant who declares the entire village guilty of treason. In the face of this crisis, Vitin must choose between blind obedience and his own conscience."
