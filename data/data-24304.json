    "overview": "Hailed by one music reviewer as \"the grooviest, wildest, slickest hit ever to pound the screen,\" \"The T.A.M.I. Show\" is an unrelenting rock spectacular starring some of the greatest pop performers of the 60s. These top recording idols – representing the musical moods of London, Liverpool, Hollywood and Detroit – packed the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium with 2,600 screaming fans and virtually brought down the house. This is the cinematic record of that electrifying event."
