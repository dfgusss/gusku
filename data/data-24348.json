    "overview": "Former sailor Fikret is having trouble settling into his new life in Istanbul and has begun to make use of the local church's facilities. When priest Artin goes on a trip to Vatican, Fikret starts selling off the church's cellar of expensive wines and stays in the priest's room at night. Fikret spends most of his remaining time gambling on horse races and lecturing Asim, a naïve young boy working at the car wash located next door to the church who perceives him as a surrogate as a father figure. Fikret and Asim learn of a rich widowed businesswoman, Deniz, who thinks that her sister, Selen, has had a spell put upon her and is prepared to pay anything to have it lifted. Fikret decides to go to Deniz's house disguised as a priest but gets more than he bargained for."
