    "overview": "Claire feels threatened by illness, Leo takes everything lightly and even eats raw chicken. She writes endless text messages, he tells her what's going on in a nutshell, she's always in the mood for sex, he loves hiking in the mountains with his buddy, she repairs the bike herself, but he doesn't have the time. Nevertheless, the two are a couple, but very often ask themselves why, argue, make up and break up."
