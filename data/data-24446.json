    "overview": "A young couple, a king and queen termite, settle down and build a grand empire within a massive mound. When the mound suffers damage from rain, fire, and a falling branch, the scent from the termite colony is carried off by wind and catches the attention of a swarming driver ant colony led by their \"black queen.\" Now a war is waged as ant and termite fight a battle of minuscule proportions for the survival of their very colonies."
