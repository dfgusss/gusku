    "overview": "Andy Van Allen, former hero of the cult 80s futuristic TV show Children of Castor, is now working as a hotel porter. When Andy receives an unusual offer - the Children of Castor fan club-organised cruise around the Greek islands, with him as the principal celebrity - a combination of Andy's cynicism, his fans' adoration, a misguided sexual encounter and an unexpected reunion with his more famous co-star, Nick Lee, ensure the paradise cruise is far from plain sailing."
