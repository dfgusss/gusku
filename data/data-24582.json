    "overview": "When a freak accident strikes down a busload of nubile, competition bound cheerleaders, all hopes seem lost for the Fighting Beavers of Stinkwater High...until a backwoods Mortician, his opportunistic college-dropout nephew and a simpering night janitor discover that one of the girls is still alive despite her gruesome disfigurements. The three men soon find themselves pitted against each other in a winner takes all face off for control of the last of the Beavers, and the recipe for an astonishingly potent healing elixer!"
