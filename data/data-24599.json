    "overview": "Adam is a typical college-aged guy... which is to say he wants sex 24 hours a day. But when he meets - and falls for - Eve, a scorchingly hot coed who's still very attached to her virginity, the waiting game is on! While his college buddies score left and right, and campus hotties make tempting passes, Adam ponders an explosive question: Will Eve say \"It's the right time\"... before he completely goes out of his mind?"
