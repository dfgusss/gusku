    "overview": "In the pursuit of perfection, an alien civilization has evolved to become beings of pure light energy, unbound by the limitations of the mortal body. But they have lost something precious along the way: the ability to experience physical pleasure. They send a representative to Earth to record human sensory experiences. Taking the form of the perfect human female, \"Kara\" uses her powers to unlock the secrets of sensuality so long forgotten on her world."
