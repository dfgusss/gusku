    "overview": "Tracy Morgan’s first stand-up special on the channel, Black and Blue. Performing at New York City’s Apollo Theater, the 30 Rock star let his demented brand of humor loose on the crowd. His jokes hit on everything from politics and airport security to borderline inappropriate quips we can’t include here. Audience members doubled over in laughter. Yup, he was that funny."
