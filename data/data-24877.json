So he pleads his friend, Changwook a production designer, to go with him on a trip even though Changwook had already made plans with his girlfriend, Moonsook, a composer. Eventually Changwook brings his girlfriend along and they all go on a trip to the west coast to visit Shinduri Beach Resort, which is covered with cherry blossoms and a flowing mist. There, Joongrae makes advances on Changwook's girlfriend, Moonsook. Already a fan of his films, Moonsook doesn't hide her interest. So later, while avoiding Changwook's eyes, the two spend a heated night together. But the next day Joongrae's face is filled with anxiety as he proposes to go back to Seoul. He and Moonsook then part awkwardly."
