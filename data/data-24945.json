The hero: Dylan Hunt, a handsome, vigorous 20th-century scientist awakened from suspended animation - just the \"breeder\" a Confederacy dominatrix has been waiting for! Can Hunt defy the Confederacy and free his downtrodden fellow males, or is he doomed to slavery on Planet Earth? A sequel to Gene Roddenberry's Genesis II."
