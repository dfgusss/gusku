    "overview": "The red-haired Loulou, who suddenly appears in Guy and Alfred's car, doesn't exactly bring them luck. The heavily armed and rather tough dropout from the terrorist scene not only sets her ex-comrades on them, but also a vengeful cop. The two guys don't have time for cat-and-mouse games. They are traveling from Amsterdam to Barcelona on behalf of a drug ring with several bags full of ecstasy, while Alfred's wife Anna is being held hostage in Holland to secure the dealers. If the two don't answer a call at a set time every few hours in a specific phone booth, Anna will not fare well. Then Loulou literally falls from the sky and throws all their plans into disarray. And time is running out..."
