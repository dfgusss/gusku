    "overview": "The Lowrys are starting a new life, moving to the quiet Northern California town of Placerville. But when they are \"adopted\" by a clever yet lovable stray Golden Retriever, their lives change in ways they never imagined. It's not long before the Lowrys discover that Pilot is pregnant. But when it comes time to find new homes for the puppies, the Lowrys learn how hard it can be to say goodbye and how a determined Golden Retriever can show them a thing or two about the bonds of family. Pilot wants her puppies back! Can the Lowrys retrieve the Retrievers from the wacky cast of characters that adopted them? The Retrievers is a heartwarming story about how a stray Golden Retriever, along with her litter of pups, teaches the Lowrys some big lessons about life, love, family, and what's truly important."
