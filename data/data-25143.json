    "overview": "On the night he promised to take Daisy out, Donald Duck discovers he's broke. Desperate for spending money, he gets it in the last place he knows: his three nephews' piggy bank. After their night out, Daisy thanks the 'rich' big spender, which only makes Donald remember how penniless and remorseful he is. What ensues is Donald's guilt (and imagination) taking him on a nerve-wracking ride in the role of a wanted man."
