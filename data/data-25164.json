    "overview": "Donald is digging in his gold mine, mostly generic looking dark rocks, and being clumsy, to the great amusement of his burro, when he accidentally fills his cart with a load of pure gold. The burro takes off and dumps the cart, Donald and all, into a scary looking crusher. Donald barely makes it through the machinery."
