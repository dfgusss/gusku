While they are planning the heist of the century, robbing a bank's cash transport vehicle, the gang continues with their usual scams. They divert parking fines to the wrong account, one belonging to Inspector Koistinen, arrange a pre-arranged lottery line by bribing the authorities, and break into a political party's secret office to blow up the safe. Inspector Koistinen is in a tight spot. To make matters worse, he is assigned a new partner, Eevariita, who soon figures out that the same gang is behind all the scams."
