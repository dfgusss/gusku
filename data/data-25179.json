The people of this land are able to use quartz for whatever purpose they desire. Yet one person, Rygart Arrow, is not. He is an \"un-sorcerer,\" a person unable to use quartz. But this characteristic will enable him to pilot an ancient Golem, one strong enough to put up a fight against the invading army of Athens."
