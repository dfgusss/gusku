    "overview": "The greedy lord of the manor, von Wurstburg, lives lavishly on his estate, heavily taxing the local peasants, when the official heir to the estate, the noble Sir William, arrives. At the same time, the mysterious outlaw Robin Hood, who helps the poor, sets up camp in the nearby woods. When the estate threatens to fall into Sir William's hands and the peasants rise up against von Wurstburg's excesses in Robin Hood's footsteps, the lord finds himself in a double bind."
