    "overview": "Rescuing the Energy Minister who was kidnapped in Russia is a highly risky operation with no room for error. This requires the most experienced and talented spies trained in our country's special laboratory conditions. The President, Prime Minister, and Cabinet consult with Fahrettin Bey, the head of intelligence. Fahrettin Bey assigns this mission to agents SPP and PP7. The agents mistakenly land in Azerbaijan instead of Russia, where they meet Gülinaz and her niece Selma. Facing the agents are the Russian mafia, Mossad, the CIA, and Gagarin. The problem is larger than the state anticipated."
