    "overview": "Lost in a book of fairy tales, Dale imagines what it might be like to do battle with a vicious dragon---and thanks to Donald he'll soon get to find out. As Donald moves his hulking steam shovel into position, intent on clearing a path right through their tree for a new freeway, Chip and Dale ready themselves for battle just like the knights of old. With a tuna can for armor and a hat pin for a lance, Chip charges into battle atop his trusty steed, Dale. But with some quick thinking, Donald makes his phony dragon a fire breather. Who will prevail in the medieval battle for the junkyard?"
