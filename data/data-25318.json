    "overview": "Baron Wilhelm von Tandem, CEO of the Tandem Corporation, gets mixed up with a spitting image of himself, an innocent country boy Kalle. Both characters conveniently amnesiac, they start living each other's lives and dating each other's girlfriends, succeeding in their new roles better than in their original ones. Level-headed Kalle soon spots the bad guys who are after the Baron's money, and the Baron brings innovative ideas to the countryside."
