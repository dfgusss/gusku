    "overview": "Mike says, \"A few years ago my therapist suggested I keep a journal of all the crazy things that were going on in my life, so that I could keep things in perspective. Around the same time audiences were demanding more material, and I realized that other people might enjoy these stories-so I started sending them out to my mailing list. Now, my Secret Public Journal has become a Comedy Central special and DVD for all the world to see. Not sure this is what my therapist had in mind.\""
