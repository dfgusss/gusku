    "overview": "Great adventures can hatch from the smallest eggs. Fucsia wants to learn to do magic just like her father, and so is pleased as punch when she is allowed to go to witches' school. There, Fucsia learns to make wind and conjures with the clouds. But her magic often has unexpected results, however, as she is sometimes that little bit too ambitious."
