    "overview": "Called \"Comedy's Lovable Queen of Mean\" (New York Times) and \"Howard Stern on estrogen\" (Toronto Star), Lisa Lampanelli is the insult comic for a new generation. Now, with a onehour special airing on Comedy Central, she makes her major-label debut with that same outrageous, in-your-face performance on CD and DVD with Take It Like A Man, recorded live at The Improv in Hollywood, FL. Shocking and hilarious, no-holds-barred and politically incorrect, Lampanelli is Don Rickles with breasts and major PMS."
