    "overview": "A fanatical animal rights activist releases giant pythons into the Everglades, believing the wild animals should be set free. When they start decimating the native animal population, an over-zealous park ranger feeds experimental steroids to wild alligators so they can fight back. The giant pythons and gargantuan alligators go on a killing spree, and it is now left up to the two feuding women to put aside their differences to put a stop to the creatures and the destruction."
