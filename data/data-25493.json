    "overview": "Margaret Cho returns to the concert stage with a \"killer\" one-woman show that has taken audiences by storm. Filmed live at the Warner Theatre in Washington D.C., Assassin features a fresh dose of Margaret’s ground-breaking and controversial brand of humor. Taking aim at the Bush administration and the religious right, she pulls no punches in her assault on the \"ever devolving\" state of the union. The result is an unforgettable performance featuring Margaret at her raw, irreverent and hilarious best."
