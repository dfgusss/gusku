    "overview": "Sheik El Sahid has built a theme park at the underground holy City of the Dead in Egypt that an earthquake has revealed. Two American publicists are brought over to make it a success, to advertise its fantastic mechanised speaking mummies. The place soon appears to be cursed especially when the ancient mummies begin breaking free and wreaking havoc."
