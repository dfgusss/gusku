    "overview": "In one of her first film appearances Yukari plays an undercover Japanese criminal police officer investigating the gang led by Yamashita (Yasuaki Kurata). As in most of these Taiwanese films, slapstick comedy alternates with intense action. An absurd plot has something to do with missing bullion and a treasure map. Yamashita’s gang wants it, and so do an unlikely band of heroes, including an incompetent traffic cop, his cop wannabe girl friend, and a couple of card sharks who have teamed up with an infatuated gas station owner. Some of Taiwan’s best action actors provide excellent kung fu action."
