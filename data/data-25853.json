    "overview": "When their new TV-shop time machine mysteriously vanishes with Gaus and Roms aboard, it reappears a thousand years in the past, right where Oslo’s Tusenfryd now stands, dropping them into a brutal Viking-era feud between the Badejarls and the Granbarkebirkebeiners. Tasked with settling which clan will wield the cursed, all-powerful sword Tyrfing, they must broker peace (or chaos) while Brumund back home monitors the saga via their “Time-Phone.”"
