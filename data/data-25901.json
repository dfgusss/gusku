    "overview": "The daughter of a prominent medieval Norway landowner, Kristin grows up in total harmony with the ideals of the time: strong family ties, social pride and devout Christianity. As she accepts the fact that she has been arranged to marry the son of another landowner, Kristin's beauty, innocence and purity evokes violent emotions around her: envy, lust, murder, revenge. She seeks refuge in a convent, awaiting marriage. Here, the passion of her life strikes, the knight Erlend Nikulaussonn. However, their love cannot be private, and suddenly Kristin is the centre of a scandal."
