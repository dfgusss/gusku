    "overview": "Reveals an alternate history of the post-war world. This is a version of history where, in contrast to what we are all told, fascist ideology prevailed. The story of Klaus Barbie, Nazi torturer, American spy, tool of repressive right-wing regimes, is symbolic of the real relationship that the \"Western\" governments had with fascism and makes us see the world as it is today - and the politicians that inhabit it - in a different way."
