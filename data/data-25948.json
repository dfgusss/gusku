    "overview": "Donald is the baggagemaster at a remote railway station. Part of the latest cargo shipment is Hortense the Ostrich, who is a bit too friendly with Donald, and who eats everything in sight, whether it's food or not (mostly not): a concertina, an alarm clock, some balloons, all of which start reacting when Hortense gets the hiccups."
