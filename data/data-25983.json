    "overview": "Kasia and Pawel, having got married, live in the village of Brzozki, 10 kilometres from Grabow. Kasia wants to return to her pedagogical studies, so she does not want to have children yet. Pawel announces that he wants to break away from the traditional village farm and focus on specialised sheep breeding, which causes a family argument. Kasia's parents anxiously await the birth of their grandchildren. Things get even more complicated when the Wolanskis arrive in Grabow. They offer to help Kasia go back to university, but in return Kasia has to look after little Piotr as the docent is leaving for London where he has received a month-long study grant."
