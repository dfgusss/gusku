But when this duplicitous duo tries to dupe the wrong man, they are ensnared in a world more dangerous than they could ever have imagined. Seduced into working for him on dangerous jobs beyond their small-time capability, Paul and Georgia suddenly have everything they've ever wanted...and even more to lose."
