    "overview": "František Procházka was retired early because his soldiers sang a forbidden song about a c. and k. field marshal. Since he is a soldier in body and soul and his request for reactivation is rejected, he decides to visit his nephew Rudi. Upon arrival, he finds the uniform of the secretly expected field marshal in his nephew's room and, after putting it on and walking through the corridors of the garrison in it, he has no choice but to complete the entire play to the end. With his performance, he helps his nephew to get married, convicts the wanted spy and is eventually promoted to the real marshal and called back into service."
