    "overview": "My various experiences in the field of failure have allowed me to highlight specific areas in which it is crucial to get disorganized and to recognize the steps to be taken to end in ineffective management. This sentence is totally incomprehensible. It's normal. The longer the sentences, the less we understand them. It is the strategy of failure. To help us understand the failure and illustrate this video, we will need two men who we will call Luc for further misunderstanding. We will also need a woman whom we will call Sylvie for hygiene reasons."
