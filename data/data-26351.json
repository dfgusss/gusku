    "overview": "In The Beckoning Silence, Joe Simpson, whose amazing battle for survival featured in the multi-award winning \"Touching the Void\", travels to the treacherous North Face of the Eiger to tell the story of one of mountaineering's most epic tragedies. As a child, it was this story and that of one of the climbers in particular, that first captured Simpson's imagination and inspired him to take up mountaineering."
