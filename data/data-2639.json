    "overview": "Cafe owner Paul Perlacher is a real pig: not only are his daughter and sister Trude embarrassed constantly by his disgusting behavior, but his tenants are subjected to every legal trick under the Sun to get them to move out. Nevertheless, Amalie Hartning's a stubborn woman and can take care of herself well when it comes to her tyrannical landlord. If that weren't enough for Paul, his daughter's gone and fallen in love with the nephew of this pain in rear! And when Paul's ordered to jail by the courts, that really is the last straw."
