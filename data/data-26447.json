    "overview": "Massimo is forty-two years old, but has been attending eighth grade for thirty-two years, in short he is a teenager in all respects. In reality, Massimo has always refused, on an unconscious level, to grow up and become part of society. Amedeo and Lucia, Massimo's eighty-year-old parents, obviously worried, go to a doctor who explains to them that their son suffers from Peter Pan Syndrome. Only a big shock can bring him back to normal."
