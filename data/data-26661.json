    "overview": "Francesca and her husband, Martin, are dreamers. They live a carefree existence oblivious to the increasingly hostile world closing in on them. Their huge Parisian apartment is a refuge for an array of colorful characters in need of a roof over their heads and in particular for Adrien, a filmmaker who turns their home into his office, studio and love-nest. When their mean landlady tries to evict them all and Martin succumbs to the charms of a beautiful vamp, Francesca comes up with some original and entertaining solutions in the defense of her and everybody else's happiness."
