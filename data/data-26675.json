    "overview": "Fred Astaire-fan Clément invites comic-book artist Luc to Sunday dinner with Clément and his wife Violette. Luc's girlfriend Margot announces her pregnancy, prompting Luc to forget about the invitation, but Clément insists that Luc join him. After Luc arrives and sees that Violette is only a life-size plastic doll, he decides to leave but gets clobbered on the head. Awakening, he finds he's been handcuffed to the bathroom sink and gagged. Cruelties ensue, with crazed Clément getting visionary advice from both Astaire and Violette."
