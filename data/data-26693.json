    "overview": "Day or night, it's a hot and wild summer at Malibu Beach. When the sun is high, it's Dina's job to patrol the area. Being the hot new lifeguard on duty isn't as easy as you'd think -- there's the older, muscle-bound beach idiot Dugan continually lusting after her, while jerk kids fake drowning just to get her to save them. And who can forget that pesky bikini-stealing dog?!?"
