    "overview": "During the final days of WWII, chaos ruled. The German submarine U-461 went down along with its entire crew just off the coast of Denmark. U-461 however, was no ordinary submarine. 50 years after the war ended, two brothers go scuba diving for fun and discover that their every move is being watched and that some things should just be left alone."
