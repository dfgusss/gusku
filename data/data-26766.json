    "overview": "Alexandre Dumas, at the height of his career, takes Auguste Maquet, his chief literary collaborator or 'ghost writer' ten years his junior, to meet a young unknown admirer, Charlotte Desrives.  The two men are at the summit of their artistic collaboration for they have just published \"The Count of Monte Christo\", \"Queen Margot\" and \"The Three Musketeers\". If it's Maquet who writes the majority of the texts, both the honours and fame go to Dumas."
