    "overview": "A couple visits Mexico to scout a new location for their furniture manufacturing business, and hit a cop with their car on the way back stateside. Realizing that if they report it they could land in a Mexican jail (guilty until proven innocent), they clean up the car and return home. A few days later, an insistent man shows up wanting a job -- and insinuating that he saw something in Mexico that he would not want to report -- the couple must make a decision about how far they will allow themselves to be blackmailed."
