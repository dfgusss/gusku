    "overview": "Seven short films in which gay youths and young men negotiate society, sometimes successfully, sometimes not. In several, teen boys come out, perhaps first to a close friend - how will the friends react? For some youths, coming out risks violence. In two films, love is thwarted - by mother, in one, and by immigration, in another.  The collection includes \"Summer\" (Great Britain), \"Night Swimming\" (USA), \"Running Without Sound\" (USA), \"Out Now\" (Germany), \"Œdipe N+1\" (France), \"Hitchcocked\" (USA), and \"The Bridge\" (Australia)."
