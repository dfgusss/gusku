    "overview": "Casablanca, the year of the baccalaureate. The carefree life of Morocco's golden youth and all its excesses: car races, friendships, music, alcohol, but also first loves and the anxiety of transitioning to adulthood... Marock presents a side of Morocco that is often unknown, seen through the eyes of Rita, 17, who is determined to live life on her own terms."
