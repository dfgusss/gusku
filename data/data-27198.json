    "overview": "Years after his wife Kate died, Ned Stevens still cringes at the thought of dating other women. After all, why would he start dating again when he still has to look out for his daughter Liz? But when Liz comes home for a visit from college, she brings a surprise guest who will throw Ned for a loop. Can Ned ever accept that his little girl has fallen in love with David, a practically perfect know-it-all who drives Ned crazy?"
