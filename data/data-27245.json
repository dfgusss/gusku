    "overview": "The Olsen-Gang must carry out an entrusted task for the Prime Minister's Office itself: H.C. Andersen's original quill must be stolen from the Danish Export Museum, supposedly for the Kingdom's safety and good reputation. But Hallandsen has again taken Egon's ass. There is nothing less than the Danish national feeling, Egon's honor and 30 million at stake. But Egon has a plan - he needs a drill, a glass of honey, a bottle of organic prune juice and a good pile of dead rats. Christiansborg is put on the other end, the metro is delayed more than usual and the Queen's guards suddenly dance the cancan."
