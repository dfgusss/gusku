    "overview": "In Crazy About Ya, different characters meet. Sometimes their stories are closely interwoven, sometimes they just brush past each other. But sooner or later everyone runs into the hero of this story, Saint Jan. As a true sanctus ex machina he makes sure that in the end, they are all a bit crazier about each other again."
