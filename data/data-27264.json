    "overview": "Some Say No is a new Italian comedy with a very serious subject: the way the country's society is corroded by favoritism that pushes inferior people to the top in virtually every field. In Florence, three thirty-somethings band together to wage their own war on the system. Each of them is a person of talent who has been pushed out by \"favorites\" or raccomandati, people who have muscled in on the promotions they ought to have gotten by pulling strings."
