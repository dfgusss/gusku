Sandra Dee replaces Debbie Reynolds in this and the third Tammy movie. This film introduces both a new theme song, \"Tammy Tell Me True\", and the character of Mrs. Annie Call, played by veteran Beulah Bondi. Mrs. Call ultimately moves in with Tammy at the Ellen B. and would be the catalyst for the events in the following film, \"Tammy and The Doctor\"."
