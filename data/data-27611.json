Inspector Lomenzo investigates a series of bizarre murders, each linked by the fact that pages from the German children’s book \"Shock-Headed Peter\" have been left at the scene of the crime. As the bodies pile up, Lomenzo is guided by a model and a surveillance expert to a decadent club frequented by the rich and powerful."
