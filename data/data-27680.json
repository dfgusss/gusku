    "overview": "A single mother arrives at a Black Sea resort with her young son but can’t find a place to stay—landlords refuse to rent to women with children. Spotting a modest pediatrician vacationing alone, she convinces him to pretend to be her husband so they can secure a room. What begins as a practical arrangement quickly turns into a web of humorous deceptions, nosy neighbors, and emotional surprises, as the two strangers are forced to play the perfect couple under the curious eyes of everyone around them."
