However, the two men have different destinies: Rosario becomes a crime boss, while Michele, after being arrested for murder and released from prison, discovers the world of boxing thanks to his trainer Sabatino (Giorgio Colangeli). Seeking a definitive change of life and emancipation, Michele moves to Berlin, where he is introduced to the underground boxing circuit."
