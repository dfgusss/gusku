    "overview": "In 1970, a string band called \"The Possible\" was really popular and made a fever among young people. One day, the band received a microphone as the present from a mysterious fan. Miraculously, the microphone was a time-machine that accidentally took them to the future, in 2007, where the modern music rules and they're just an out-of-date item."
