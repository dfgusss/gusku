    "overview": "Caleb and Rachel team up to lead the Patrick Henry College team in the intense world of collegiate moot court competition. Caleb looks to date Rachel, but she's waiting for courtship. Meanwhile, Caleb becomes caught in a moral tug-of-war between his parents - a newly Christian father and a feminist attorney mother. Caleb's mom goes before the U.S. Supreme Court defending abortion, even as Caleb simultaneously takes on the opposing legal argument at the national moot court championship."
