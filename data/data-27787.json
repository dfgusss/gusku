    "overview": "With a prestigious job and a loving family, Emilio (José Coronado) has the kind of life someone would kill for. But beneath it all is a horrible lie. Emilio's wife, Ágata (Adriana Ozores), becomes suspicious when Emilio picks up a guest pass to enter the Bank of Spain -- where, ostensibly, he works as an economist. But the house of cards starts crashing down when Emilio meets a needy college student, Rosana (Marta Etura), and begins an affair that proves disastrous."
