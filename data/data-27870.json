    "overview": "Vita, an employee of a private spy agency, is handed a case of tapping into and listening to the mysterious life of a new \"client\". By day, her work on the case seems all the more routine; by night she's involved in a steamy and passionate affair. Sooner rather than later however, Vita realizes that the man with whom she is having an affair with, is the same man she's been spying on for the agency. From this point on nothing is what it seems, as Vita becomes entangled into a deadly game of cat and mouse."
