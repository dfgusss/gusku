    "overview": "When a man dies of a heart attack, a stage and radio mentalist believes he has willed him to die because he was angry with the man.  Riddled with guilt, the mentalist cancels further shows,  breaks off his engagement to his female partner, who can read minds while in a hypnotic trance, and takes refuge in the eerie wax-museum-cum-home of another woman friend."
