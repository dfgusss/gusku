    "overview": "In the same world two sisters live. One of which was largely unlucky at the very beginning of life: Ulyana is a \"gable child\" who, by the age of thirty, had preserved the outlook, behavior and reactions of a ten-year-old girl. The second - Lisa - was not even luckier. She is a healthy person whose life is completely dependent on a disabled sister who voluntarily or involuntarily destroys the plans of her ambitious sister actress."
