    "overview": "Winner of the prestigious Prix Louis Delluc in 1958, \"Moi, un noir\" marked Jean Rouch's break with traditional ethnography, and his embrace of the collaborative and improvisatory strategies he called \"shared ethnography\" and \"ethnofiction\". The film depicts an ordinary week in the lives of men and women from Niger who have migrated to Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire for work."
