    "overview": "This documentary dissects a slanderous aspect of cinematic history that has run virtually unchallenged form the earliest days of silent film to today's biggest Hollywood blockbusters. The film explores a long line of degrading images of Arabs--from Bedouin bandits and submissive maidens to sinister sheikhs and gun-wielding \"terrorists\"--along the way offering devastating insights into the origin of these stereotypic images, their development at key points in US history, and why they matter so much today."
