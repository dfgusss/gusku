    "overview": "During the general elections of 1994, Tunin, a mechanic with a firm belief in communism fears that his party is about to lose,  so he journeys to a northern village to stir up trouble. He isn't there long before he is arguing with a beautiful hairdresser. Their debate is fiery as is his growing and impossible-to-disguise passion for her. She too is intrigued with him, but their disparate ideologies threaten to keep them apart."
