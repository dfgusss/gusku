    "overview": "After killing the crooked mayor, a homicidal janitor named Abdullah goes to work for a butcher who has invented a new language for the town's planned futuristic theme park.  In the butcher shop is a septic tank where scraps of meat are dumped, which has produced \"balonium,\" a radioactive fuel source sought by space aliens. The aliens revive the mayor, whose body is hanging in the meat locker of the butcher shop, in an attempt to gain access to the balonium."
