    "overview": "The film follows Will Fletcher, a musician, and Eve Fisher, who works in a pub where he is performing, during one night in London. After Will has saved Eve from a drunken customer at closing time, they stay up all night together, meandering through the streets of London and forging a relationship. Next morning, Eve takes him to see her Alzheimer's-suffering grandmother.  The film is often compared to Richard Linklater's films \"Before Sunrise\" and \"Before Sunset\", as the style is very similar."
