    "overview": "It's the 1980's and a group of typical horror movie high school kids are getting together to hold a séance in a haunted house. Naturally, people start dying preposterously bloody deaths, girls are getting naked for no apparent reason and people walk into pitch black rooms and say things like \"Is someone in here?\" Will any of these poor, hapless kids survive? Or will their bodies fill the house with blood and...well, you know!"
