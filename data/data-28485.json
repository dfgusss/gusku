    "overview": "Rendy and Jáchym have enough of spending New Year's Eve with their parents plus they want to learn how to ride a snowboard. They have not yet stood on a real board, just a video game one.  They win a season pass at the Arcade and they arrange an accommodation at Jáchym's cousin Milan's mountain lodge. Jáchym has to take his annoying sister Marta with him. They are allowed to stay in exchange for doing housework. The lodge is also housing three hot girls who the boys fall in love with. Jáchym and Rendy have to walk the dog, clean the dishes, clean the lodge, get along with Marta and other things all while they learn how to snowboard and impress the girls."
