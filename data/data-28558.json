    "overview": "Everyone in the village of Bouzolles knows the Tuche family, who live by the philosophy \"Man is not made to work.\" Despite their lack of money, they strive to be happy... that is, until their hand-to-mouth existence is turned on its head. After winning the lottery, the Tuches get rich beyond their wildest dreams and move to Monaco. And while attempting to fit in in their swanky new homeland, they struggle to stay true to the same principles by which they've always lived."
