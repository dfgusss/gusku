    "overview": "Teacher Sara has always played by the rules and has never thought of herself as one who's attracted to the \"bad boy\" type. That all changes when tattoo artist Virgil takes part in a classroom show-and-tell session and Sara reluctantly finds herself attracted to the biker guy. Will straightlaced Sara allow herself to fall for a man who's completely different from her?"
