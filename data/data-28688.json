    "overview": "Renowned writer Shen Chiang had become so popular for his scripts that the studio let him direct as well. Here he continued his winning ways with this tale of the end of the Sung Dynasty and the survivors who band together to save their prime minister. Shen outdoes himself with this bold and stirring story of daring Sung avengers (led by Shaws' first international star, Lo Lieh), who must fight their way out of trap after trap."
