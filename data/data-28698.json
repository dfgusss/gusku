    "overview": "Asian fans of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon recognized that its director Ang Lee was actually inspired by director Chu Yuan and novelist Ku Lung's wonderful tales of a \"martial art world\" where all wushu warriors try to attain the \"Deer Sword\" and escape from the insidious maze-like \"Toy Land.\" Master kung-fu choreographer Tang Chia leads the king and queen of Shaw's swordplay, Ti Lung and Lily Li, in a fascinating and entertaining adventure of consummate swordmen and sorceresses."
