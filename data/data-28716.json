    "overview": "Mickey buys a boat kit, and enlists Goofy and Donald to help assemble it. The plans say, \"so simple a child could do it\", so of course, they have their share of troubles. But before long, they're ready to launch the Queen Minnie, with appropriate fanfare, at which time, all the collapsible parts collapse."
