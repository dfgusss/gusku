    "overview": "Veteran action actor and director Lu Chun-ku set his sights on a tale of Ching Dynasty royal intrigue as an excuse to hire his favorite action stars, gather three choreographers, and film one fight-filled conspiracy after another. Liu Hsueh-hua is the title character caught between battling princes. Then there's award-winning actor Ku Feng, \"Bastard Swordsman\" Hsu Shao-chiang, \"King of Shaw Brothers' Screen Villains\" Wang Lung-wei, \"Venom\" Sun Chien, and even the director shows up to get his kicks in this danger-fraught adventure."
