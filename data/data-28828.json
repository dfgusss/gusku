    "overview": "It's Pluto's birthday party, but Mickey's dozen or so nephews seem to be having all the fun. Their present is a wagon so Pluto can pull them; the \"Pin the Tail on Pluto\" game doesn't go quite right, and everything seems to prevent Pluto from having his birthday cake. But Mickey has planned ahead."
