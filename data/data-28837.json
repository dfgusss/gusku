    "overview": "Donald's nephews are always playing instead of doing their chores. Donald is going to punish them, but the \"voice of child psychology\" convinces him to play along instead. This works well when they chop the wood to burn him at the stake. Meanwhile, however, a trio of Pygmy cannibals that escaped from the circus are out to do the very same thing to Donald with a cauldron of water."
