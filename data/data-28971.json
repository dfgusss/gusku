    "overview": "Mickey courts Minnie in the Gay Nineties: they take in a vaudeville show and go for a drive in his horseless carriage, to the strains of \"While Strolling Through the Park\" and \"In the Good Old Summertime\". Goofy rides by on a penny-farthing bicycle, and the whole Duck family rides by on a bicycle built for five."
