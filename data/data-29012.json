    "overview": "The hard-luck life of Commander Steve Rogers takes a surprising turn for the better when his dilapidated spacecraft crashes in Puckerbush Gulch, a place populated only by gun-toting, hard-drinking cowgirls. What appears to be an ideal situation soon turns out to be slightly more complicated, as Commander Rogers learns the problems of being the only man in a town of sensual, lonely women."
