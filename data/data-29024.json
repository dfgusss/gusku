Flight leader Alex (Dirk Benedict) is debriefed but his inquiry is shelved. More jets mysteriously disappear in the sequestered area. Alex's covert investigation, with the assistance of the beautiful NATO researcher Isabella (Patsy Kensit) is officially subverted by a Committee of Inquiry. So on his own reconnaissance, the defiant Alex hazards a final desperate search for his missing friend, discovering the secrets shrouded on the forbidden mountain!"
