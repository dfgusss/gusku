In this show 'Antenor' made its first appearance, an advanced robot (for the time it was built - 1979) that weighed 80 kilos and was equipped with several motors that allowed it to move around the stage, turn its head, etc. The robot caught fire during the last performance of this play (Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico - 1980) in the middle of the stage and before the astonished gaze of all those who were there."
