    "overview": "Hitting the Nuts is the 'true' story of the 2009 Scott County, Indiana Poker Championship as told by those who were there. This mockumentary follows the town preacher, busty waitress, lovable redneck dad, portly returning champion and a simple Amish farmer as they do battle in the town's annual, illegal Texas Hold 'em Tournament."
