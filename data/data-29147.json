    "overview": "In a small and remote Latin American mountain village, all the men are recruited to fight in the country's civil war. Left to fend for themselves, the women of the town, led by Rosalba, slowly emerge from their supporting roles as wives and daughters to become unwitting founders of a remarkable new society: an all female utopia.  When the men, led by an American reporter, return to try to reclaim their power, a clash of sexes ensues with unsuspected consequences."
