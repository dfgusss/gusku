    "overview": "The film tells the story of Grace, who is still grappling with the disappearance of her daughter five years earlier, and her husband Lukas, who is trapped in his own helpless grief. He and Grace have long since stopped communicating. As Grace confronts a series of small absurdities in her apartment building, Lukas finds himself unable to complete even the simplest of daily tasks. When something truly heartbreaking happens in a family, the deepest response is often unspoken."
