Kei and Yuri have traced young Missinie to the forest of Nolandia, but their investigations have stalled thanks to the less than helpful Chief of Security. But Kei and Yuri never let a little bureaucracy stand in their way. It's the unicorns and UFOs, not to mention the rampaging killer robot, that are going to be the problem as the Dirty Pair tackle their toughest case yet."
