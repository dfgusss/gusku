When a series of mysterious attacks on mining operations has world leaders pointing fingers and pinning blame, 3WA naturally send in their top agents to investigate. But are the Lovely Angels up to the task of stopping a mad scientist bent on taking a long dormant alien race to its final evolutionary form? Throw in a thief after a bottle of WWII-vintage wine and it's a safe bet that nobody's safe. It's more chaos, more mayhem, and even more destruction than ever before as the Dirty Pair take on their wildest case yet!"
