    "overview": "A unique female specimen from the Pleistocene Age, a.k.a. the Ice Age, is kept in cryogenic stasis while being transported back to civilization in a military convoy. When the convoy is raided by mercenaries who move the specimen onto a plane, the \"Ice Queen\" awakens in an uncontrollably aggressive state and kills the pilot, causing the plane to crash into a resort. Having survived the crash, the Ice Queen embarks on a rampage throughout the resort, forcing the survivors into a desperate battle for survival."
