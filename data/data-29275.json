    "overview": "A jet-propelled white rabbit flies through the vulva of a supine woman into a wonderland where people and objects turn inside out, changing shapes and identities at warp speed. Events roughly follow Lewis Carroll's \"Alice in Wonderland.\" The caterpillar and the queen make appearances, as does Alice. Images and symbols are often sexual. At the end, Alice asks, \"Who has had such a curious dream?\""
