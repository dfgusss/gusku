    "overview": "The story of the life of Pope John Paul II, who played a role in the lives of billions of people, and was one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century. On display are never-before-seen archive images, historical reconstructions and important interviews with the pontifex's advisor, who was his confidant for 40 years. Testimony offers an exceptional insight into the personal and spiritual life of Karol Wojtyla, a man whose lifelong devotion to God and humanity ultimately earned him the title Pope John Paul II. The film is narrated by Michael York ('Omega Code', 'The Bible Series'), and accompanied by music by composer and Oscar winner Vangelis. Shot in secret, forbidden corners of the Vatican, 'Testimony' is full of new and fascinating revelations about the Pope."
