    "overview": "Verona's peace is disturbed by the rivalry between noble families: the Montesco and the Capuleto, irreconcilable enemies. The two families have continued fighting to make life unbearable in the Italian town. The Prince of Verona informs the chiefs that the two families respond with their lives if there are new struggles. At a ball in honor of Juliet, the daughter of Capuleto, incidentally meets Romeo, son of Montesco. Both fall in love immediately, not knowing that their love is impossible."
