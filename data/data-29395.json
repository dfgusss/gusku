    "overview": "Get ready to scream with laughter! Sam Kinison's primal scream will echo down through the comedy hall of fame summing up so much of modernity's horror and stupidity. This concert was taped at the Wiltern Theatre where Sam was joined with the Randy Hansen Band and a salacious slew of sinuous sirens, including his wife Malika. Join Sam Kinison and guests for a concert guaranteed to make you laugh 'til you cry for more - there's something for every member of the family - Sam Kinison style!"
