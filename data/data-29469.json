    "overview": "Strict and authoritarian, Rudran disowns his elder daughter for eloping. His younger daughter, Thilothama, lives under his rigid rules until she falls for Shiva, a kind-hearted mechanic. Fearful of her father’s, she struggles to confess her love. As emotions and traditions clash, will Thilothama and Shiva defy the odds, or will Rudran’s unyielding stance on love tear them apart?"
