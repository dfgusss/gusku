A peeping tom is caught with photos of her having sex with a teenage drop-out but he is later released due to lack of evidence.  The investigation, conducted by Inspector Silvestri and the assistant public prosecutor Vittoria Stori, focuses on the girl's parents.  Conspiracies and horrors pile up, as do the body parts."
