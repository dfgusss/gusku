    "overview": "Joe, a reckless cab driver, accidentally hits someone with his taxi. The person he hit is May, a sweet girl who walks with a limp due to one of her legs being longer than the other. Joe mistakenly thinks that he's paralyzed May for life; so in order to make it up to her, he works for her family, helping them run their grocery store. Soon, Joe falls in love with May, but she's slow to return his affection."
