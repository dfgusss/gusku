    "overview": "When the distinguished psychiatrist Robert Block discovers that his young wife Carole has betrayed him, he is thrown completely off balance. His jealousy hinders him from caring for his patients as responsibly as he should, until Léo Debond , a psychotic and depressive single, seeks his help. Robert sees him with a mixture of compassion and secret contempt. After Carole wants to leave him for good, he takes advantage of Léo’s trust and dependence and makes him an accomplice in a secret plan aiming to end his own pain."
