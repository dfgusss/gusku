    "overview": "Jean and Shag Williams locate a newly built house and decide it's perfect for them to buy. One thing the developers forgot to tell them about was that it is built on a graveyard. Within days toilets start to flush by themselves and the garage door moves up and down by its own accord. Will Jean and Shag realize that the place may be haunted by ghosts before it's too late?"
