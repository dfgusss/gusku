    "overview": "François is 39, Muriel is 22... He is married, with a child, and lives comfortably. She is single and unattached. They meet by chance... He wants her... She resists... Gives in... Latches on to him... There is a name for it: adultery. Adultery in all its fleeting joys, rare moments, creeping jealousy, open conflicts, stolen pleasures, tears held back, tears shed."
