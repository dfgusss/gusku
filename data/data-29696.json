    "overview": "Henry Adler, an outwardly normal banker, yearns to make it in show business and still answers to his overbearing father. When Henry is hired to act in a television police drama, he realizes his big break has arrived and decides to do whatever it takes to get into the role — even if that means donning his police costume in public during off hours. It isn't long, however, before Henry begins to take the law into his own hands as his violent side chillingly emerges."
