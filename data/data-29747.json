As he leads a group of volunteers up the haunted mountain, he encounters a bevy of sexy demons as well as a lovely girl named Siu Sin.  After wooing her with some candy, he falls for her... and then realises that he is caught in a deadly triangle; another guy, a demon-hunter named Yan Chek Ha is also in love with Siu Sin.  However, before the two men can settle their differences, they have to contend with the evil Tree Demon as well as a one-armed demon hunter who is determined to kill all the supernatural beings."
