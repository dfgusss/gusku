    "overview": "Kate, a depressed thirty-something who unsuccessfully attempts suicide by slitting her wrists. Reflecting briefly upon her circumstance in the hospital, she realizes that nothing has been solved, whereupon she vacates the premises, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, a black coat, and flimsy sandals. Shortly thereafter, at a bus station, she requests from the attendant a bus ticket to wherever, with consideration to the limited funds she has to spare. The attendant insists on a destination, or even a direction - Kate spins about, points, and says, \"that way\". The story then evolves to include Barry Tubb, her love interest, who rekindles her will to live."
