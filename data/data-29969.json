    "overview": "Noah Melville, a popular college professor and confirmed sensualist, provides scholarships for gorgeous college girls through an escort service, whose satisfied clients include the chairman of the school board, the chief of police, and even the mayor of their idyllic college town. When a young woman's dead body is found near the campus, the moralistic new detective in town, Patrick Kelly, investigates, leading him to the professor. Exposed, Noah must leave his devoted wife and daughter and flee the law. Kelly, for his own reasons, takes the law into his own hands to bring Noah to justice. Their deadly showdown has a surprising result."
