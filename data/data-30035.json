    "overview": "A remote village 100 kilometers from the city of Buenos Aires. Stephen, Matías, Alejo, Damián and Guido were born 13 years ago in this small town. They have always been friends and together they share the monotonous summer afternoons sitting on the stoop of a women's hairdresser. Anxious, restless, impatient for a change, they go through the most confusing period of experiment -- the transition from childhood to adolescence."
