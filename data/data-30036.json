    "overview": "Bertrand dutifully visits his terminally ill wife every day, braving the long train and bus ride to and from the hospital. Lorraine not so willingly visits her boyfriend who was diagnosed with colon cancer. They bump into each other during one of their visits and begin to meet for coffee. Coffee turns into Lorraine offering to drive Bertrand to the train station and the two turn to each other in their time of grief and confusion."
