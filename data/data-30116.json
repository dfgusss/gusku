When the dean decides teh only way to stop their schemes and antics is to graduate them, they have to go out and find real work. Auggie hears that Samantha is planning on selling her father's garage to fast food king Wrangler Bob, and comes up with one final scheme; a risky bank loan to turn the garage into stiff competition for Bob. When it looks like Bob will win after all, they develop a very special sauce that keeps the crowds coming because it has the effect of being an aphrodisiac. Bob doesn't like to lose, so he sends his \"spy\" Dixie Love to infiltrate the restaurant and find out their secret. The ensuing FDA investigation culminates into a hilarious case of disorder in the court!"
