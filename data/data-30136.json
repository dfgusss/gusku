    "overview": "After Coimbatore-based Ravichandra Verma passes away, his young son, Raja, assumes the responsibility of running the family business as well as ensuring that his brother, Ajay, gets a good education - much to the chagrin of three of his uncles. Years later, while on a trip to Uttaranchal, despite of warnings from a Pandit, he gets killed by a female assassin, but his family is informed that he is missing. Shortly thereafter, Gyaneshwar Kale and his sister, Sravani/Shivani, will inform the family that Raja is still alive but is handicapped and suffers from memory loss. The family is overjoyed but are not aware that Raja is actually a hoodlum/extortionist known as Bottu Seenu/Raghu Rokda."
