    "overview": "Confronted by Apartheid and a father who was Minister of Censorship, Ingrid Jonker searched for a home, searched for love. With men like Jack Cope and André Brink she found much love, but no home. Later, in his first speech to the South African Parliament Nelson Mandela read her poem \"The Dead Child of Nyanga\" and addressed her as one of the finest poets of South Africa."
