In another story, Harriet's parrot is killed, and she has problems dealing with her loss. Then, there is a gambler, \"Regret\", who has bloodhounds on his trail when he becomes a murder suspect. Finally, \"The Brain\" is bleeding profusely, and his friends search for a way to save his life through a blood transfusion."
