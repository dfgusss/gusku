    "overview": "Dr. Frick is head of the psychiatric ward of a clinic. He and his wife Anna have an eleven-year-old daughter who suffers from a hereditary disease. Anna finds it very difficult to cope with her child's illness. The fact that Frick only concentrates on the child in his free time also puts increasing strain on the marriage. Dr. Frick increasingly takes refuge in the meticulous fulfillment of his professional duties. Duty and morality are foreign words for the pompous Christoph: superficial and narcissistic, the event manager believes he is in the fast lane of life. His girlfriend Sarah suffers in the chaotic relationship and ends it. She soon meets the loving Ben."
