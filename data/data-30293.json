    "overview": "The Walking Tall legacy continues with Bo Svenson as Sheriff Buford Pusser, a one-man army trying to rid his town of corruption. Out to avenge his wife's death at the hand of the mob, Sheriff Pusser blows up their moonshine operation. With Buford breathing down their necks, the syndicate hires two hitmen; one a maniacal race car driver, the other a deadly gunslinger. Any other man would've hightailed it out of there, but then Pusser is no ordinary man."
