    "overview": "For about as long as he can remember, Joe has always had to roll with the punches-living each day in the slums as if it may be his last. But when a wild brawl sends the kid to the slammer, the appearance of a fierce rival sparks a new passion for boxing within him. Spurred on by an unlikely mentor who believes he could go the distance, Joe leaps into the ring. But as he rises through the ranks, Joe realizes that he's no longer fighting for himself-he's fighting for tomorrow."
