    "overview": "Two rock groups, one male, the other female, decide to do a combined effort to hit the road of stardom by doing a show together. As the show is getting on the road, the lead singers of the two groups have a disagreement which brings about a parting of ways, in love as in life. A historic tour of the country begins, which through the music and performances of the two groups as well as the reactions of their audiences, reveals, beneath the comedy, glimpses of today's real competition between the sexes, seen against the background of Icelandic life."
