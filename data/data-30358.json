    "overview": "Henry can't control himself : he's got to cheat, con, plot. It's not his fault, it's his nature ! Underhand deals, compromise, lies, and betrayals are the daily lot of this guitarist for provincial village dances. And he has no qualms about anything : getting his depressed sister committed, ripping off his mother who's grief-stricken after the death of her companion, compromising himself with an extreme right-wing party."
