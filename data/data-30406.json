    "overview": "Battle Beyond the Sun (1962) is the English-dubbed and re-edited American version of the 1959 Soviet film Nebo Zovyot (The Heavens Call). Acquired by Roger Corman and reworked by a young Francis Ford Coppola, the film relocates its Cold War “space race” to a fictional future where rival nations—North Hemis and South Hemis—compete to reach Mars first. When one crew’s mission goes awry, their rivals risk their own flight to attempt a daring rescue near the Martian moons, where strange cosmic dangers await."
