    "overview": "In the sixties, the Drugstore \"minets\" were the best dressed, believed only in themselves and imagined themselves reinventing everything. The drag, the clubs, the first joints, the vacations on the Normandy coast, but also love and show-offs. Philippe and Marc do the four hundred tricks. Charlotte and Nathalie do the same on their side. Against a backdrop of Otis Redding and the Animals, a sentimental education before the upheaval of May 1968. The fury of living in a France that is bored."
