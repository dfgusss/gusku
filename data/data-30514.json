    "overview": "Maggie Baker has a weight problem, and her high school classmates won't let her forget it. They shamelessly ridicule her, and even go so far as to nominate her for Homecoming Queen as a joke. Maggie, however, decides to take the nomination seriously, collects the required signatures and starts campaigning. A number of students get behind her, threatening the chances of the popular clique -- who resolve to sabotage Maggie's campaign by any means necessary."
