    "overview": "A story inspired by real events that took place in the port of Valparaiso. Four poor children have been abandoned because their father, who is out of work, steals cattle to feed them and the police have arrested him. The story takes up the children's point of view and is structured in four episodes that describe their inevitable descent into the world of marginality and crime. Faced with life in a brutal way, from their problematic social situation, they head towards a marginality that is difficult to avoid."
