    "overview": "Finding Joe is an exploration of the studies of mythologist Joseph Campbell, and of their continuing influence on our culture. Through interviews with visionaries from a variety of fields—interwoven with enactments of classic tales by a sweet and motley group of kids—the film navigates the stages of what Campbell dubbed \"the hero’s journey\": the challenges, the fears, the dragons, the battles, and the return home as a changed person."
