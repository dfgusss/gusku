    "overview": "A surreal stationmaster, a poet of mechanics, a laid-back retiree, a cheerful centenarian, a traveling farmer, a gyrocopter hovering in midair, a rooster ending up in the pot... Life as it is takes things as they come and people as they are. Far from the cynicism of the city, the film reveals the quirky reality of a small village in the Aveyron countryside: a rural bouquet of humanity whose heroes are connected by the same desire, that of living in Najac, close to nature, and living well there, free."
