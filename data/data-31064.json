    "overview": "Middle-aged best friends Eddie and Patsy live in an endless haze of drugged, drunken selfishness. The duo leave no impulse unenacted and no lust unsated — be it for sex or the latest in designer clothing. Waking up from a night of drunken debauchery, the two dip right into a feast of champagne and caviar, much to the irritation of Eddie's elegant mother and her resentful daughter. As Eddie stretches an appalling pair of leopard-print leotards (complete with matching shoes, purse, and hat) over her massive rear end, she and Patsy learn of a handsome young rollerblading delivery boy who quickly becomes the object of their lust."
