    "overview": "Isa and her older brother Kars' parents change course and start a campsite in France. Isa and Kars feel like they are moving to Timbuktu and losing everything. Fortunately, they don't complain for long, because they soon make new friends. But while new friendships blossom, Camping Timbuktu runs into trouble. Not far from them, another campsite has opened, and its unsympathetic owner tries to damage Camping Timbuktu in every way possible. It even looks like the campsite will have to close... Will Isa and Kars manage to keep Timbuktu open?"
