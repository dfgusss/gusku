    "overview": "Two college boys from SoCal attend a spring break vacation at a ski lodge in Idaho to get insider tips on how the president of the ski club manages to attract so many girls as a way to make amends to their girlfriends. Alongside this relatively simple endeavor are ice-skating polar bears, love triangles, musical numbers, and quick-switching in and out of drag to achieve the goal of discovering what went wrong in the boys' romantic lives."
