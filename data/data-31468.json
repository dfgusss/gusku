    "overview": "Fernand Sarrazin, who runs a nougat factory to perfection, is a happy bachelor, notwithstanding the acrimonious presence of his sister-in-law Julie. Love enters his life in the form of a young orphan, Cécilia, whom he saves from drowning, falls in love with and marries. The treacherous Julie uses a young pianist to lead Cecilia astray. She returns, however, repentant, after a short stay in Paris. Good Fernand forgives her, but when he learns of his sister-in-law's actions, he chases her out of his house."
