    "overview": "Comedy about idiotic (the two can't even add 1+1) kidnappers, both played for unknown reasons by Joe Piscopo, who capture two young girls and hold them for ransom. However, in \"Home Alone\" fashion, the two girls make fools of the two men. The film becomes even sillier as two horses who talk to one another decide to rescue the girls from the kidnappers"
