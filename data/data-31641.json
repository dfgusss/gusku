    "overview": "Mert, who has been studying and working in America for many years, returns to Istanbul to become the company's manager in Turkey. Here, he goes on a boat trip with his friend Bora and Bora's wife Aylin. During the trip, Mert's girlfriend Dilek joins them in Göcek. While the group is enjoying their vacation, one day Deniz (Berrak Tüzünataç), the daughter of one of Istanbul's wealthiest families, comes aboard their boat. Deniz's sarcastic and reckless attitude affects Mert. Until that day, Mert had always done what he was supposed to do, following the path his family had laid out for him. Now, he begins to question himself. To find out whether a handful of sea is truly the sea, he has a long journey ahead of him."
