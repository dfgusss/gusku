    "overview": "She drove me into a corner, then forced me to go beyond my limits. She made me confront the absolute: love, sacrifice, tenderness, abandonment. She dislocated me, transformed me. Why didn't anyone warn me? Why doesn't anyone ever talk about this?\" Un heureux événement, or an intimate view of motherhood, sincere and with no taboos."
