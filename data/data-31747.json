    "overview": "A story about two childhood friends who are reunited by fate. This reunion after many years becomes an opportunity for a melancholy journey into the past, to recall memories of an irrevocable time gone by, as well as to reflect on true happiness, new values and the meaning of life. The plot of the film takes place as if on two time planes: on the screen, contemporary events are intertwined with images from years ago, when the heroines were still very young and the adult world seemed so distant."
