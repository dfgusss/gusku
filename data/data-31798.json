    "overview": "Police detective Tom Canboro hails from a Christian family. One night, his eccentric brother-in-law Jason seemingly goes insane and tries to kill his wife, calling her a \"hater\". Canboro realizes this may be a conspiracy going as far as devil worship, but gets in a car crash. Waking in a strange hospital, years have passed and people all over the world are wearing the mark of 666 on their right hands, and those who don't are killed. Franco Macalusso, the believer in global peace, now controls the world, and is trying to bring the world together as it was at the Tower of Babel."
