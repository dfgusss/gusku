    "overview": "Nails is the story of an assassin (his name is Hitman) who has a terrible headache and the only solution to cure it is drastic, that is, sticking a series of nails into his skull! This is only the first step towards a form of self-destruction that in the final part of the film gives us some truly unhealthy and disturbing images, obviously accompanied by blood and offal. A true visual delirium studied in the smallest details starting from the use of color in the three phases that punctuate this debut on acid."
