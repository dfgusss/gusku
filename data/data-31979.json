    "overview": "In 1991, Russia discovered big money. In 2011, money is everything… Present-day Moscow. A bag with a million euros in cash is stolen form the car of a successful business man “with connections.” Going from one happy owner to the next, the moolah changes hands quickly… And it all began when the millionaire Grigory refused to declare his taxes."
