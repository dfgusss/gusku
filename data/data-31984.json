    "overview": "One of the milestones of Israeli cinema. It displays the atmosphere of the late 50s in Israel from the viewpoint of young boy Alex, who is just turning 13. His mom is the classic \"Polish Mother\", his school friends are young hustlers dreaming of nude girls, his schoolmaster is a nervous Russian immigrant. The street speech is full of Polish, Russian, and Farsi slang, full of the small talk that had later entered everyday speech. The soundtrack consists solely from the American music of the period."
