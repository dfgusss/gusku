In the wake of a high-profile financial scandal, he is summoned into his director's office and accused of negligence. Rainier has no choice but to resign, but he soon realises that he has been made a scapegoat. He begins his own investigation in an attempt to clear his name and discover who is responsible for the enormous hole in the bank's finances. It soon becomes apparent that he is up against a very powerful and dangerous opponent."
