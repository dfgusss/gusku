    "overview": "This feature documentary chronicles the last days of Dispatch, quite possibly the biggest band that never signed with a record label. In a time of upheaval in the music industry, their do-it-yourself style started a grassroots fan phenomenon that is changing the way indie bands (and record labels) do business. The band's final concert, \"The Last Dispatch\" drew 110,000 fans from every U.S. state and 20 foreign countries for one last free show in Boston in July of 2004."
