    "overview": "Vansan is 30 years old, but he never learned to make decisions. Whatever it is. Should he marry his girlfriend, should he start a business with his friend, what color should he buy shoes for? Life for him is an eternal dilemma.  But one day, fate made a choice for him. Vansan crashes into an advertising post by car and makes a leap in time for 16 years in advance.  Now at about forty, he heads a large corporation, is married to a woman with whom he is barely familiar, has a teenage son who is constantly bold to him, and an early-ripened daughter. And he has absolutely no idea what to do with all this.  Realizing that he has become everything that he always despised, Vansan is desperate to go back and make the right choice. But can he turn back the clock? .."
