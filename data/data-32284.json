    "overview": "Hunky Daniel couldn’t have it better: great parents, a successful career, and his beautiful fiancée Jen. But in his seemingly perfect life, there is one temptation; he has a thing for his adorable, openly gay former college classmate, Tommy. After a few drinks, Daniel succumbs to his repressed desires sending these two into a torrid affair they will never forget! Funny how love and lust have a way of messing up even the best laid plans of man."
