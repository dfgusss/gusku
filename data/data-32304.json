Luckily, the next day is September 1, the first day of school, and Gena decides to take Cheburashka to school so he can learn. After failing to buy a school uniform, they go to the school anyway, only to find it is closed for repair. Shapoklyak uses Lariska the Rat to stimulate the workers to repair the school quickly. As the school also doesn't have enough teachers, Gena and Shapoklyak volunteer to be teachers."
