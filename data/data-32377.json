    "overview": "Bobby Riley is an affable Irish-American guy-next-door, gay and still in the closet. Bobby's discomfort with being openly gay is a source of friction in his relationship with his partner, Andy. His sister, straight-talking lawyer Maggie, knows Bobby's secret, and when their father dies, she persuades him to come out to his three brothers. The revelation doesn't just surprise his brothers, it forces some other family secrets to be revealed."
