    "overview": "The adventures of two amiably aimless metal-head friends, Wayne and Garth. From Wayne's basement, the pair broadcast a talk-show called \"Wayne's World\" on local public access television. The show comes to the attention of a sleazy network executive who wants to produce a big-budget version of \"Wayne's World\"—and he also wants Wayne's girlfriend, a rock singer named Cassandra. Wayne and Garth have to battle the executive not only to save their show, but also Cassandra."
