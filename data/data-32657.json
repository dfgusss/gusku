    "overview": "A cinematic version of the life of famous Indian saint-poet, Annamayya (born May 1408), follows the spiritual awakening of the mystic composer Annamayya, who's first motivated to write a song of praise after visiting a temple. His devotion is put to the test when he vows to fast until he comes face to face with God, an act of faith for which he's rewarded with a blessed meal of prasad. As his fame as a singer spreads, Annamayya eventually becomes a real personification of the holy Nandaka Sword."
