    "overview": "Surfing buddies, Andy and Dennis, find their prime surf turf is going to be radically changed by uncool Mayor Dawes for a private development - a real beach bummer! Realizing that things don't compute, the guys plan a major mayor protest party on the beach by linking up hundreds of friends on their home computer. Using their hardware to attract software, they have created a whole new version of The Data Game! Come down to the shore for a totally gnarly bash that Annette and Frankie could only dream about."
