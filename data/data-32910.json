    "overview": "Bor, in eastern Serbia, was once home to the largest copper mine in Europe. Now it’s just the biggest hole. This astutely observed coming-of-age film captures the pitfalls of the adult world, where idealism no longer seems to have a place, as two teens come to realize they have no choice but to grow up."
