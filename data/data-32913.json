    "overview": "Animated-family adventure based on a true story that tells the heart-warming, coming-of-age story of a man and his best-friend, a lovable and fearless dog named, Jock. Set in the Bushveld near what is today the world famous Kruger National Park, this animated family tale is about Jock's adventures with Fritz, his master. Jock escapes death, builds crazy friendships and displays his unrivalled loyalty to Fritz. The story is set in the late 1880s when Africa's mineral richness, teeming animal life and incomparable natural beauty drew and captivated explorers and adventurers from all over the world. A place where big game roamed in their thousands and the wildest tales were true! Jock Of The Bushveld is a great story and the only animal classic to come out of Africa."
