    "overview": "In the small Moravian town of Zvěstov, all the men live for historical battles. They represent the French army, led by their mayor Touchyn (Bolek Polívka), who has had a monopoly on the role of Napoleon for years. This time, they are preparing for a big event—the unveiling of a Napoleonic fountain in the neighboring town of Podolí, attended by television crews and journalists. However, the mayor of Podolí has bad news for Touchyn – this time he has hired a real foreign actor to play Napoleon, who looks more like him. Touchyn is offended and decides to ignore the ceremony. He convinces the people of Zvěstov to do the same, but they regret that they have rehearsed for nothing..."
