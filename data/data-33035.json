    "overview": "There are moments in our lives when our whole being is put to the test.  Our ideals, our ambitions, are forgotten and we crave for escape.  Escape into our world of dreams.  And such is Anuradha's (Leela Naidu) story.  The daughter of a rich man, she has everything she desired, yet she goes on to marry Dr. Nirmal Chowdhary (Balraj Sahni), an idealistic doctor, who wants to serve the poor in the villages of India.  Later when she is shown what she is missing by living with this poor doctor, she has to make the choice.  The choice of her life or her love."
