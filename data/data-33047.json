    "overview": "A look into the underground world of Bruce Haack, a genius whose past work continues to garner recognition with time. The homespun musician couldn't have done it without the support of his family, friends, lovers, and the neighborhood kids he called \"starchildren,\" all of whom paint the big picture of Bruce's life legacy and so-called dimension of imagination. In addition, various musicians of many genres have joined in today showing worldwide support, thus contributing to Bruce's objective, \"Sure it's nice to be famous, but I'm more interested in obtaining a telepathic following.\" As for the music world, history's future king is coming from the past."
