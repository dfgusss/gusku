    "overview": "At his father's request, Aditya attends a law college in the coastal metropolis of Visakhapatnam, although he actually wanted to become an engineer. On the first day he meets the beautiful Anjali. Over time, the female student slowly begins to become interested in the strange newcomer, who acts nice and friendly but doesn't seem to be interested in anything else. The college is notorious for its disobediently and disorderly students. It's not the professors who are in charge on campus, but rather the student leader Satya. He is also in love with Anjali and sees Aditya as a competitor who needs to be put in his place. So Aditya faces multiple problems as he tries to reform the unruly students while dealing with his terrible past that everyone doesn't know about."
