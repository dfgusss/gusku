    "overview": "In a South Bohemian village in the middle of silver ponds and dark forests lives Jindřich (Radek Valenta), who one day goes out into the world with a firm decision to free the cursed princess. On the way, he reaches a haunted mill, where the beautiful Eliška (Andrea Černá) lives with her father. Eliška likes the young man, so she tells him that the cursed princess is in the pond and Jindřich remains in the mill as a helper. However, the devil and the waterman, who like Eliška, don't like that. With the help of various intrigues and incantations, they try to expel Jindřich from the mill, but soon a third groom appears there - an old rich man. However, since Eliška rejects all the suitors, the miller's father gets angry and gives her an ultimatum: either she chooses a suitor herself by the full moon, or the one who asks for her hand first gets her. So a fight ensues between the grooms..."
