    "overview": "Cantinflas works as a porter, who writes letters and speeches in his old writing machine to earn an extra money, despite the fact that he still goes to school. The sentimental issues come when Cantinflas falls in love of his pretty neighborhood (Silvia Pinal), who is handicapped and unable to walk. The thing wont be easy, because a young military man also has feelings for the girl. But the porter wants to see her happy, and he will become a sort of Cyrano De Bergerac, writing love letters to her signed by the young soldier. His plan is simple: to win money in the horse races in order to pay the operation which will make her walk again."
