    "overview": "A little girl Assol met a wizard and it has been foretold: \"... it will be a fine sunny day when a beautiful ship under scarlet sail comes and the noble prince will take you away from here. He'll take you to the world of your dreams, where you will be loved and happy.\" The neighbours told jokes about her, children teased her, but she waited for her prince. She trusted in the miracles and waited. Arthur Gray's rule was \"if you can make a miracle, do it!\". And he made a miracle for the wonderful romantic girl."
