    "overview": "A talented girl from the provincial Russian town Pasha Stroganova dreams of becoming an actress. She plays the role of Baba Yaga in the amateur theatre — and does it so organically that the visiting filmmaker offers her the most difficult role in the historical drama about Joan of Arc.  She was given not only great acting talent, but the talent of deep, selfless love.  A dream comes true: she is invited to the main role, and she begins a completely different life, full of real creative torment, insights and true happiness."
