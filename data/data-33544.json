    "overview": "A would-be Marine fails basic training, and is sent home wearing the \"baby blue\" fatigues of a washout. En route, he is mugged by a battle-fatigued Marine Raider, who leaves him to hitch-hike home in an undeserved hero's uniform. A small Colorado town takes him in, treating him like the hero he appears to be."
