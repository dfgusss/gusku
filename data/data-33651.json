    "overview": "The conflict between Dole Food Company and Swedish filmmaker Fredrik Gertten unfolds dramatically in the documentary \"BIG BOYS GONE BANANAS!\" as the corporation attempts to suppress Gertten's earlier film, \"BANANAS!\"—chronicling Nicaraguan workers' lawsuit against Dole. Initially selected for the 2009 Los Angeles Film Festival, \"BANANAS!\" was abruptly removed from competition, followed by a negative article in the Los Angeles Business Journal and legal threats from Dole's attorneys. Gertten captures this saga of corporate intimidation, media manipulation, and legal challenges in his documentary, showcasing the struggles documentary filmmakers face and highlighting the threat to freedom of speech posed by powerful corporations protecting their reputations."
