The greatest martial artists, athletes, actors, directors, and producers in the entertainment business today will share their feelings about the one who started it all. We will interview the people whose lives, careers, and belief systems were forever altered by the legendary \"Father of Martial Arts Cinema\". Rarely seen archival footage and classic photos will punctuate the personal testimonials. Prepare to be inspired."
