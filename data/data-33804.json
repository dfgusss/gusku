    "overview": "At the height of the Korean War, 15,000 U.S. troops were trapped and outnumbered 10-to-1. In a harrowing battle, these soldiers fought 78-miles to freedom and saved the lives of 98,000 refugees. After 60 years of silence, the survivors of the Chosin Reservoir Campaign of the Korean War take us on an emotional and heart-pounding journey through one of the most savage battles in American history."
