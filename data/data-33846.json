    "overview": "The fate of sailors' wives is not easy. For six months they do not see their husbands, for six months they raise their children and wait for news from their loved ones. The boy's mother of this story also lives from letter to letter, in separation. Every day she anxiously awaits the arrival of the postman and smiles only when she receives the long-awaited envelope. She gives all her tenderness and attention to her little son - she will either sew a torn button, then cook a delicious dinner, but her thoughts are constantly with her husband. And the son of a naval officer understands his mother, regrets and helps her to go through a difficult separation."
