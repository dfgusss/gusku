While searching for costumes a store clerk kicks them out, leaving the gang to comes up with their own home-made costumes.  Then they are off to the movies to scare old Searchlight Johnson, then more hijinks with Mudfoot Brown, and old lady Bickwell.  As you can probably guess, things don't go too well and they learn their lessons...  Searchlight catches them up to no good in the theatre and throws them out. Mudfoot Brown eats most of their candy, and old lady Bickwell turns out to have the best Halloween treats in town."
