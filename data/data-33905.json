    "overview": "A puppy, born with a strangely light-blue coat, finds himself shunned by all. No one wants to play with him or call him a friend — even the Grey Dogs keep their distance. But when a fearsome Pirate suddenly attacks the island, he enlists the Black Cat’s help to kidnap the Blue Puppy."
