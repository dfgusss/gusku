    "overview": "A dopey Pilgrim goes hunting a turkey who speaks in a Jimmy Durante impersonation and runs the local black market. War and rationing gags abound (Pilgrims line up behind a sign reading \"Ye Cigarettes Today\"), as well as a running gag featuring a bear wearing an \"Eat at Joe's\" sandwich sign. The turkey harnesses the power of gags to save himself."
