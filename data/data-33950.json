    "overview": "For almost 30 years, bookseller Jordan has lived and worked in a neighborhood in Berlin that has become a social hotbed. As Jordan witnesses a teenager brutally beating up an older man, he intervenes and files a complaint - with unimaginable consequences ...\r\n Director Dror Zahavi (\"Everything for my father\", \"My life - Marcel Reich-Ranicki\") succeeded after a screenplay by Jürgen Werner (\"Tatort - With a steady hand\", \"Schimanski - layer in the pit\", also with Götz George) an atmospherically tightly staged and outstandingly played portrait of a so-called problem district. Here nothing is glossed over, but instead the reality shown and the powerlessness of our judicial system mercilessly layed bare. A highlight of 2010!"
