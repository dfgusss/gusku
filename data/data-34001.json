    "overview": "Growing up in Granada, Spain, young David Fandila always dreamed of being a matador. This documentary captures the rise of \"El Fandi,\" one of Spain's most renowned bullfighters, who first entered the ring at age 14. While it's never in doubt that Fandila is at the top of his game, filmmakers Stephen Higgins and Nina Gilden Seavey weigh the significance of bullfighting as a cultural tradition against its inherent danger and cruelty."
