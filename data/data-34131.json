    "overview": "13-year-old Radost lives alone with her father Bruno. But he is not like other fathers; he suffers from oligophrenia: he has roughly the mental capacity of a ten-year-old. However, this intellectual disability has not prevented Bruno from being a great father to his daughter all these years. With Radost's awakening puberty, however, the first serious problems are now becoming apparent. Radost is becoming increasingly aware of how much she is mentally superior to her father. Her responsibility, which until now has been a part of their relationship, is becoming a great burden for the young girl, who actually wants to lead the normal life of a 13-year-old."
