    "overview": "Circa 1800s, an intoxicated Jamindar insults Durga Devi by stealing her temple idol. Enraged, Devi kills him and places a curse on his heirs that, every 48 years, she will take one family member. And every 48 years, a male heir meets an unfortunate, accidental end. Come present day (the end of another 48 years), it's Murari's turn."
