    "overview": "A trio of naive, but eager young Midwestern women go to California to teach summer school classes at Regency High School: Perky and willful Conklin T. starts up and coaches an all-female football team, stuffy chemistry teacher Sally Hanson manages to loosen up after she falls hard for a surly juvenile delinquent student, and pert and liberated photography instructor Denise Carter becomes involved with both a two-faced male chauvinist jerk and a more decent and understanding guy."
