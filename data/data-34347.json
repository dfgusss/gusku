    "overview": "A ditzy American girl visiting Monte Carlo is hired by a tennis champ to be his \"cardboard lover\"--to pretend to be in love with him so he can teach his two-timing fiancé a lesson and win her back. What he doesn't realize is that the girl isn't pretending --she actually is in love with him, and she sets out to win him for herself."
