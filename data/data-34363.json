    "overview": "An urban drama of love and marginality, drugs and falls into the abyss. This is where Josetxo San Mateo's long-distance survey begins when David, a chic who lives on the street for vocation, begins to see María. One day she decided to approach her and enter a poem that she wrote for her: Báilame el agua. She doesn't hesitate to follow him. It's not easy to live on the street: bad companies, drugs, delinquency, including prostitution, become road workers."
