Still distraught over his wife's death, he blows up every moonshine still in McNairy county and burns the brothels and whiskey joints to the ground. Having gone too far, he's voted out of office, but that doesn't stop the mob from seeking their revenge. Buford soon discovers how small his town is when he runs out of highway with the mob on his trail."
