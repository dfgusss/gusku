    "overview": "Geum-soon, once a top-ranked volleyball player, is now a common housewife with a six-month old daughter and a clumsy husband. On the first day her husband goes to work, she spends the day taking care of her little daughter who never stops crying. While Gum-soon is busy cleaning her house upon hearing her parents-in-law are coming on the next day, she gets a phone call from a club that they've arrested her husband for an unpaid bill. Amidst the merciless threatening of the gang in the club, Geum-soon rushes out into the night streets, still carrying her baby on her back. It's past midnight with less than three hours to go before her in-laws arrive. In the seediest part of Seoul, Geum-soon's husband is practically being held for ransom for the alcohol he didn't drink, Geum-soon has no clue where the bar is, two rival gangs are chasing after her, the pot is boiling at home, and her daughter is wailing while Geum-soon is leaping over trash cans in a dark alley."
