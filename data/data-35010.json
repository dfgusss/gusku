    "overview": "Middle-aged newlyweds Larry & Barbara spend their honeymoon at a palatial Filipino mansion, unaware that it is inhabited by the vengeful spirit of a notorious voodoo witch queen who was murdered a century ago. The woman's evil spirit promptly begins precipitating a variety of violent deaths in accordance with a diabolical ritual intended to bring her back to life -a process which is ultimately consummated by taking possession of Barbara's body."
