    "overview": "This rarely seen gem from master Suzuki casts teenage heartthrob Koji Wada as a young misfit who suddenly finds himself the unwitting pawn in an escalating family feud that ultimately leads to tragedy.  Lean, mean, and stylish as always, this tale of youth-gone-wild is both vibrant and touching. Suzuki contrasts tranquil glimpses of traditional regional life with the emergence of the new rock 'n' roll youth culture and the greed and seething cynicism of encroaching Westernism.  Also released under the title \"Go To Hell, Hoodlums!\", this is a melodrama as colorful, shocking, and exhilarating as one would come to expect from Japan's master filmmaker."
