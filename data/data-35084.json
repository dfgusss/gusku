    "overview": "Two young men leave a neglected but cozy native nook for a strange seaport town Kenigsberg. There they meet two girls the outsiders like themselves. Any attempt to find a normal human contact leads to misunderstanding. Or perhaps they are also lonely and unhappy. The realities, provoking a forced individualism melt in the atmosphere of the town, on which there lies a seal of historical and human cataclysms."
