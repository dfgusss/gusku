    "overview": "Documentary about British artist Andrew Logan as he attempts to put on the 2009 edition of his Alternative Miss World.  The film also presents a history of the contest (which has run eccentrically since 1972) which was set up firstly as an excuse to have a good party, but has grown into a celebration of alternative lifestyles and sexualities.  The documentary mixes archive footage, animated inserts, with talking head interviews and a fly-on-the-wall look at the organisation of the 2009 event"
