    "overview": "In God's Country is a modern day story of slavery. Young women ignored by the police and protected by \"freedom of religion\" are trapped in polygamous communities scattered throughout North America. Judith Joseph is one of them. Despite being raised under the watchful eyes of \"God's Keepers\" and knowing no other life, Judith realises she cannot watch her sixteen year old daughter succumb to the same fate she was born into. Desperate, with no other resources and no connections, Judith sets her house on fire and escapes with her five children. Alone, on the \"outside\", Judith is ill equipped to handle the challenges facing her, but she's determined to build a life."
