    "overview": "Sweet, chubby, theatrical Billy was never cut out to be a farmer or a rugby player, but as the only son of a ‘good kiwi bloke’ he’s obliged to try.  The cows are stubborn and the chores gruelling but Billy finds escape in a fantasy world playing Lana, heroine of his favourite TV show Adventures in Space.  Not everyone approves of Billy's transformation.  On the brink of adolescene, he discovers growing up is more complicated than he could ever have imagined."
