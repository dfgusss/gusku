    "overview": "Two strangers become dangerously close after witnessing a deadly accident.  On a beautiful cloudless day a young couple celebrate their reunion with a picnic.  Joe has planned a postcard-perfect afternoon in the English countryside with his partner, Claire.  But as Joe and Claire prepare to open a bottle of champagne, their idyll comes to an abrupt end.  A hot air balloon drifts into the field, obviously in trouble.  The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down.  Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket.  But fate has other ideas..."
