    "overview": "Remake of \"To Have and Have Not\" based on Hemingway short story. Plot reset to early days of Cuban revolution. A charter boat skipper gets entangled in gunrunning scheme to get money to pay off debts. Sort of a sea-going film noir with bad girl, smarmy villain, and the \"innocent\" drawn into wrong side of law by circumstances."
