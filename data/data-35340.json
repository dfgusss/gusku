When the professor announces his intention to donate the formula free-of-charge to vampires all over the world, the Vampire Mafia from Chicago and the European Group of Vampires from Düsseldorf try to muscle in and steal the formula. The action escalates crazily as an assortment of bad guys, police, vampires and other monsters, and our hero and his girlfriend are all caught up in the chase."
