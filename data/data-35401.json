    "overview": "When it comes to relationships, the \"First Law of the Jungle\" prevails: You have to kiss a lot of frogs before finding a prince! Katie is just your average hopeless romantic searching for the ideal man in the vast no man's land of Los Angeles. When Katie rejects her smitten best friend Ben and instead falls for Richard, a sexy and sophisticated composer, she thinks she's finally found the romance of her life. But Katie is about to discover that \"Mr. Perfect\" isn't necessarily \"Mr. Right,\" and that, sometimes, a frog is really a prince in disguise!"
