    "overview": "It's difficult to remember what porn was like in the 70s. In this era when pornstars are on TV, date movie stars, and are on album covers, the secret world of men in raincoats attending sleazy theaters is hard to imagine. Now most people see porn on their TV or internet. Once upon a time, though, it was a big deal for a porn star to hit the mainstream, and John Holmes did just that.  With a 14 inch endowment and not so good looks, Holmes made thousands of movies and slept with thousands of women. He became well-known for his Johnny Wadd series, where he was an international man of mystery, and hardcore sex. Eventually he got heavily into drugs, got involved in a brutal murder, and finally died of AIDS."
