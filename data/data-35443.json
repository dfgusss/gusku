    "overview": "Anything can happen and will happen in this romantic musical where four teenagers risk their feelings and dreams in the space of a single, extraordinary night. Daniel, Lina, Stefan and Therese are sixteen years old. They are the best of friends and are on their way out for the night. It is a night like any other and yet a night like no other before. When the sun rises, their lives will be forever changed. Daniel is in love with Lina, but Lina is hopelessly in love with herself and rock star Niklas Ravn. Therese is willing to offer Stefan her virginity, but Stefan would rather come out of the closet - to get closer to Daniel. But Daniel is much more interested in Therese."
