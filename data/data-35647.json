    "overview": "Hugely successful but impossibly neurotic songwriter Georgie Soloway is sliding into a mid-life crisis. He believes that all of his past romantic relationships have been destroyed not by his own failings but by the interference of the mysterious Harry Kellerman. Family, friends, and his psychiatrist cannot give him the help he seeks. When his father is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Georgie begins spending more and more time flying his personal aircraft, distancing himself physically, emotionally, and mentally from the real world."
