The Little Hen is planting corn and would like to have help from Peter Pig and Donald Duck, but they refuse stating they each have a \"tummy ache.\" When it comes time to harvest the corn, Peter Pig and Donald still refuse to help the Hen, so she and her chicks do the harvest by themselves. Finally, the hen cooks the corn and offers some to Donald and Peter Pig, but when they look more carefully they discover a surprise."
