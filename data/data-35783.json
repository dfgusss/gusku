    "overview": "Oosh and Boosh, two pot smoking hicks, meet up with Big Jim, who flies in drugs from Cuba and Colombia. Our heroes unload the plane and drive off, the only problem being that within about ten seconds of doing so, the police are on their tail. You've never met two more unlucky drugs couriers, as the police are on to them every time they try something, the mafia have changed management and want money back for lost shipments, and they're about to get stiffed for their biggest heist."
