    "overview": "Rick Bowman, a drag racing street punk, comes to the attention of crafty businessman Grant Willard. Willard bails him out of jail and offers him sponsorship as a stock car driver. Bowman accepts and enters the demolition derby-adjacent world of \"figure eight\" racing. As Bowman moves up in the ranks, his regard for his friends slips-- giving way to outright obsession with becoming the best."
