    "overview": "A village of Japanese immigrants is destroyed by a group of Ninja. These Ninja were controlled by a Grand Master who sold his talent to the highest bidder. Once a contract was taken, only death could stop these well trained killing machines. Three children were known to survive the massacre. One is living as a beggar, when in reality, he is a Master Ninja himself. One is a blind fortune teller and one has a son named Tiger, who is studying under the beggar to become a Ninja. Some forty years has past and the Grand Master is still seeking the identity of a child born to the village Princess. He will stop at nothing to fulfill his deadly contract. (First part of a longer version of the film Ninja Kids split into 3 films)"
