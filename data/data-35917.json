While cryonic suspension was used to control the most dangerous criminals there, with the computers down these deadly men are back in circulation and determined to cause mayhem. With a gang of brilliant but dangerous inmates in control, a petty thief and the driver of the prison shuttle must stand against these lawless men for their own survival."
