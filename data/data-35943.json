    "overview": "From Paris in the 1960s to London in the first decade of the third millennium, Madeleine and her daughter Véra flit from one amorous adventure to the next, living for the moment and taking all the opportunities that life offers.  But not every love affair is without its consequences, its upsets and its disappointments.  As time goes by and gnaws away at one’s deepest feelings, love becomes a harder game to play."
