    "overview": "Taking its title from Harold Macmillan's widely-reported Cape Town speech about the process of decolonisation in Africa, The Wind of Change showed the other side of the coin: the impact of colonial immigration at 'home'. The film deals with the 'colour problem' within the context of Teddy boy violence."
