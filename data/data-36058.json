    "overview": "With the oppressive climate of 1970s South Africa as the backdrop, this erotic biopic tells the story of Glenda Kemp (playing herself), a former Sunday school teacher who becomes an exotic dancer -- and provocatively shares the stage with a python. Creating an uproar and breaking every taboo in the book with her act, Kemp soon finds herself charged with indecency as the government attempts to ban her seductive performance art."
