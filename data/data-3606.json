    "overview": "Flo is not quite a normal teenager: While all his friends only think about sex he can't even pronounce the word \"S - E - X\". But everything changes completely when one morning Flo wakes up from a strange call. His penis, excited for the first time, begins to talk to him. He claims that Flo severely neglected him for 15 years and it's time to release him."
