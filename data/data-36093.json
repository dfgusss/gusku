A local moonshiner and his wife offer the strangers a place to stay until they can get help, but the thieves soon take advantage of their hosts. Both the moonshiner's young wife and his supposed hidden fortune prove to be irresistable temptations for the fugitives, but will their greed and jealousy prove to be their downfall?"
