    "overview": "Charandas, a young man in a village has no aim in life except to be a pehelwaan (wrestler). He takes an oath that he will not court or marry a girl until he hits the age of forty. But things changes when Charandas meets Chameli and falls in love with her. A hilarious take on the caste system of India, as both of them come from different castes and try hard to marry each other."
