    "overview": "The day after his funeral, the corpse of Varlam Aravidze, the mayor of a small Georgian town,  turns up in his son's garden.  Although it is secretly reburied, the corpse keeps returning until the police capture the local woman who is responsible.  This woman says that Varlam should never be laid to rest since his Stalin-like reign of terror led to the disappearance of her family and friends."
