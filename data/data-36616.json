    "overview": "If I is a Perrier Comedy Award-winning comedy one-man show written and performed by Demetri Martin at the 2003 Edinburgh Festival Fringe. It was also aired on British television as a special. The show is an autobiographical examination of Martin's life, as seen through various definitions of the word \"if.\" The title of the special comes from a lengthy palindromic poem that Martin wrote; the words \"if I\" are at the center of the poem."
