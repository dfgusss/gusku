    "overview": "His name might not be very familiar, but the works of graphic artist Milton Glaser -- whose prolific output includes the \"I Love NY\" ad campaign, as well as album covers for Townes Van Zandt and Nina Simone -- are recognizable to many. Revisiting the famed paintings, drawings, logos, prints, posters and other works by Glaser, filmmaker Wendy Keys creates a rich and engaging mosaic of a key figure in American iconography."
