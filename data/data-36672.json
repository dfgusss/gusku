    "overview": "It is the pre-Christmas season in Ytre Enebakk, and the male choir is set to sing in Christmas with the village's famous son, Fridtjof, as soloist. But the parish priest, the tax collector, and the sheriff want to spoil Christmas, so to speak, because of Fridtjof's reckless driving with snabelstoff and his frivolous dealings with the village women, and they hire a thug to take care of the matter. The women's choir is ready to take over the Christmas concert with opera diva Ragna Olm, but when things heat up in the village more than Fridtjof himself, he has to take matters into his own hands to save Christmas peace. Ytre Enebakk's great son, Fridtjof, is back in familiar style – and he has the star team of actors ever with him! The film offers humor, action, and Christmas spirit for the whole family when Fridtjof & co. sing in Christmas!"
