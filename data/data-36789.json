    "overview": "A feature-length dance music video and tale of urban exploration that follows three dancers across New York City. They turn the city's sidewalks, parks, and stadiums into an evolving stage as a story of rebellion, love, and discovery unfolds. Shot entirely in public spaces, and funded entirely by crowd-sourcing, the film is a statement about the power of community and public space. Set to the album \"All Day\" by mashup musician Girl Talk, it's also an insanely fun love letter to New York."
