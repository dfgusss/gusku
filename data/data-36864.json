    "overview": "Explores the concept of heroic women from the birth of the superhero in the 1940s to the TV and big screen action blockbusters of today. Heroic role models are important in childhood development, yet there are a dearth of these for girls. It provides a rare example of a female heroine who doesn't require rescue, determines her own missions, and possesses uniquely feminine values. Looks at how Wonder Woman's storyline changed over time while considering how women are rarely depicted as heroic, powerful, or world-changing"
