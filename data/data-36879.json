    "overview": "If ever a man seems lost in time, it would be Johnny Twennies, a newspaper writer who talks, walks and fights like he stepped out of the Jazz Age. When a pack of thugs threaten his life unless he plants a fake news story, Johnny proves he's got plenty of moxie -- and that some ideas, like chivalry and justice, never go out of style."
