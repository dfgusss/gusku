    "overview": "At the Limit is a documentary about extreme climbing. In this sports documentary, Pepe Danquart shows brothers Thomas and Alexander Huber climbing in Patagonia and on the granite rock \"El Capitan\" in Yosemite Valley (USA). A key part of the film is their attempt at a speed ascent of the 1,000-meter-high route \"The Nose,\" in which the two athletes aim to break the then speed record of 2:48:30 hours, set by Hans Florine and Yuji Hirayama in September 2002."
