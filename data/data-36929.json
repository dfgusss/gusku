Despite being a minor, Setsuko is a liberated woman who does whatever she wants, including smoking.  She even convinces Koyima to take her to a geisha house. When she gets rather tipsy, the professor calls Okada, one of his students, to take her home. The wife becomes suspicious of Setsuko when she sees Okada bringing her home."
