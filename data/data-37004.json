Until one day, when they meet by chance, the acquaintance they've made through the book begins to blossom and develop into love. They vow not to be apart from one another no matter what would come. There's a twist when Ten doesn't get his birthday present that Pao sends to him, but they still hold on to the vow that one day they'll be together forever."
