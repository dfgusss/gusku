Charlie, who plays the banjo, just inherited a house with a large basement. His best friend and manager Ted thinks it might be the perfect place for the studio but they need $ 25,000 to fulfill their dream. One day a Jamaican nurse approaches them on the street asking for help to lift a patient who has fallen down. Ted finds a collection of rare baseball cards in the house of the patient, and soon will plot a plan to steal the valuable collection to finance their studio. But when Charlie gets involved in a relationship with the nurse, Ted plans will be disrupted and his friendship with Charlie threatened."
