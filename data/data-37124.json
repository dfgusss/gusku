    "overview": "Peralejos, a quiet village in Upper Aragon, is a place where nothing ever happens. One day Angelino returns home to spend the holidays, an immigrant who drives a Mercedes and tells great wonders of Germany and their women. Pepe, fascinated by the stories of his friend, decides to immigrate, but his dream begins at five o'clock, cleaning windows, and ends at twelve o'clock pasting posters."
