    "overview": "Enrique kills a man for stealing him a check he has received due to an accident. However, things get complicated because it had not yet been cashed. This will force him to try to forge the signature and eliminate any suspect, including his girlfriend Clara, who works in a law office and who talked him about the check. Police tracks the case, but by chance Pedrito, the police inspector's son, is also investigating on his own."
