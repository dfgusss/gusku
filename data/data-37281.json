    "overview": "Masaki is about to move to the U.S. with his parents, much to the dismay of five girls who all like him in different ways. Tomboyish Takako always gives him a hard time; Haruna is a childhood friend; Alisa has fancied him since a shopping trip in nearby Shibuya; Naoko is still readjusting after a long spell in the U.K.; and Yumi ikes practicing basketball with him at night. All wonder who his \"special girl\" is, but Masaki isn't saying."
