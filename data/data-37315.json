    "overview": "Newlyweds Arthur and Vivian arrive to their honeymoon suite in Washington D.C., only to find it occupied. Arthur goes to meet Slade, his new boss, and when he returns, he finds three girls in his suite. He orders Vivian to get rid of them, but they are friends of Vivian's and as time goes by, it looks more like Grand Central Station than the quiet suite Arthur expected. As long as there's anyone else in the suite, Arthur will not stay and there will be no honeymoon."
