    "overview": "Self-absorbed Dr. Lee Johnson enlists with the Army medical corps during World War II, more out of a feeling that it's \"the thing to do\" rather than deep-seated patriotism. On his first day, he's put into place by 'Snapshot', a sassy and attractive nurse. Their initial antagonism blossoms into romance. Lee then finds himself torn with guilt over being unfaithful to his wife, Penny, who's waiting for him back home."
