    "overview": "Oklahoma outlaw Belle Starr meets the Dalton gang when rescued from lynching by Bob Dalton, who falls for her. So do gang member Mac and wealthy saloon owner Tom Bradfield, who's enlisted in a bankers' scheme to trap the Daltons. Discord among the gang and Bradfield's ambivalence complicates things, as Belle demonstrates her prowess with shootin' irons and horses, and as a surprisingly racy saloon entertainer."
