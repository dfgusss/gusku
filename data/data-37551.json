    "overview": "Best friends Adam and Kevin have a lot in common. Probably too much! In fact, Kevin is carrying on a torrid affair with Adam's girlfriend, Nina, on the side! And if this triangle wasn't crowded enough, the arrival of a seductive newcomer in town, Rebecca, promptly adds a whole new set of twists to an already tangled mix! Here's a hilarious look at how modern relationships have never been so complicated ... or so much fun!"
