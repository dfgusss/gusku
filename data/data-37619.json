    "overview": "Join us for a rousing celebration of the life and works of one of Broadway's greatest legends — the one and only Stephen Sondheim.  For the master composer and lyricist's 80th birthday, many of musical theater's brightest stars gathered in March of 2010 to perform more than two dozen sensational numbers from Sondheim's illustrious career, and several of these enduring songs are performed by the original Broadway cast members.  David Hyde Pierce hosts this magical event with Stephen Sondheim's longtime collaborator Paul Gemignani conducting the New York Philharmonic. Originally broadcast as an episode of the PBS series \"Great Performances\" (season 38, episode 2)."
