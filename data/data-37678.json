Shortly after this he is sworn into office as a senior member of the Office of Homeland Security under Tom Ridge. Once in office Admiral McKee faces the challenge of organizing this new office so as to prevent further terrorist attacks against the United States. With this in mind, Admiral McKee's wife recommends he speaks to his friend, NSA Agent Sol Binder."
