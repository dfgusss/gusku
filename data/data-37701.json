    "overview": "Sarah Sparks is pregnant and feeling wholly ambivalent, despite her boyfriend's pure enthusiasm.  A committed tech-geek, she fears she is more interested in ultrasound technology than in what's being ultra-sounded.  When her sister lures her to L.A. for what ends up being a terrorizing baby shower, Sarah keeps her rental van and hits the road in search of the source of her anxiety: her estranged mother, now living off the grid.  Small, Beautifully Moving Parts takes a comical, yet poignant look at one woman's coming-of-parenthood in the age of technology."
