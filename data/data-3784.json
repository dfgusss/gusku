    "overview": "Three tales of love, ambition, and neurosis unfold in the city that never sleeps. In \"Life Lessons\" (Martin Scorsese), a tormented painter channels heartbreak into his art. In \"Life Without Zoë\" (Francis Ford Coppola), a precocious 12-year-old navigates privilege and loneliness in a Manhattan hotel. And in \"Oedipus Wrecks\" (Woody Allen), a man’s domineering mother literally becomes a looming presence over New York."
