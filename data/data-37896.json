This documentary goes beyond the Mailer of the bookshelves and NY Times best seller list to Mailer the social critic, family man, filmmaker, and lover.  Here's a look into the life of a complex, intellectual, working class hero.  With never before seen footage of Adele Morales Mailer's startling revelations after being stabbed by her husband.  Featuring unseen footage and interviews from wives and lovers, enemies and admirers, his children and the man himself."
