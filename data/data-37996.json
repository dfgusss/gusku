    "overview": "In July of 1976, the Societé Générale of France was robbed of well over $10 million dollars by a group burrowing through the sewers of Paris. This movie is based on a book by the thieves' mastermind, Albert Spaggiari. The famous theft won the nickname, \"the great drain robbery,\" and this romanticized cinematic retelling of the true story stars Francis Huster as Spaggiari."
