    "overview": "Nerdy office worker Min gets his kicks taking sneaky snaps of his female co-workers, spying on his neighbours having rough sex, and coating himself in oil before bashing one out to internet porn; things change, however, when he mixes ingredients from his late grandfather's medicine shop to create the ultimate aphrodisiac/date-rape drug, which he uses to satisfy both his sexual urges and his desire for revenge on office bullies Winnie and Peter."
