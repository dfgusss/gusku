    "overview": "Paradise or Oblivion is a free online documentary produced by the Venus Project.  This documentary details the root causes of the systemic value disorders and detrimental symptoms caused by our current established system.  The film advocates a new socio-economic system, which is updated to present-day knowledge, featuring the life-long work of Social Engineer, Futurist, Inventor and Industrial Designer Jacques Fresco, which he calls a Resource-Based Economy.  Paradise or Oblivion by the Venus Project introduces the viewer to a more appropriate value system that would be required to enable this caring and holistic approach to hhuman civilisation.  This alternative surpasses the need for a monetary-based, controlled scarcity environment we find ourselves in today."
