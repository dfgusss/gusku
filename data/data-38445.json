    "overview": "The Junior Defenders is a quirky comedy about the cast of a 1970s TV superhero show. With a fan base that rivals Star Trek's, The Junior Defenders is one of the top hits of its era.  Twenty-five years after the show's sudden cancellation, a crazed fan named Norman Nields goes on a cross-country mission to kidnap the show's four washed-up ex-child stars, take them back to Hollywood, and then force them at gunpoint to act in his brand-new episode of The Junior Defenders."
