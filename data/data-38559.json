    "overview": "Chased by mafia boss Kreda over a mistaken €2 million debt, club president Ryszard Ochódzki follows consigliere Maria Wafel’s advice to sell land to Father Pudło, only to hatch an even bigger bank fraud with banker Koziczek to raise the cash. Flush with stolen funds and briefly enjoying political office, he hides the money in the Molibdenów home, but just as he and coach Jarząbek plan to retrieve it, contract killer Dukan closes in."
