    "overview": "ABBA - THE LAST VIDEO is the film about four hopeful musicians in search of a record contract. They pay a visit to the Big Record Company Boss and his oily assistant, performing one hit after the other, cheered on by their manager. But things don't really work out as planned...Agnetha, Bjorn, Benny and Frida look just like they did back then... or perhaps not."
