    "overview": "In rural Russia, children convicted of theft, murder and rape are sent to a home for delinquents. Without the outside world's pressures, they're finally allowed to act as children, but for some of them, this new life proves to be a challenge. This documentary tells the stories of several of these adolescents, who must endure separation from their families and who, upon release, are unlikely to be forgiven for their crimes."
