    "overview": "Ivan, a drifting immigrant in search of work and dignity, lands on an Italian island only to be met with cruelty and betrayal. Just as hope fades, he finds refuge with Martina—a silent soul who tends bees—and Father Enzo, a gruff priest with a generous heart buried beneath bitterness and stroke. As Ivan becomes part of their fragile household, he brings light to Enzo’s dark days and slowly earns Martina’s trust. But in a town wary of outsiders and family tensions simmering over land and legacy, harmony is hard-won."
