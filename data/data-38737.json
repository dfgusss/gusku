    "overview": "Nami has been creating artwork for a new video game based on images she's been seeing in her dreams. With one of the game producers, she travels out to an abandoned house that seems to match her visions. As they explore the old mansion, Nami begins to have more visions of a forgotten childhood, until at last she comes across a photo of twin infants, labelled \"Nami\" and \"Naomi\". As Nami and the producer go from room to room, an unseen person seems to be watching them from a hidden room."
