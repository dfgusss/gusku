    "overview": "When Pollyanna is orphaned, she's sent to live with her crotchety Aunt Polly. Pollyanna discovers that many of the people in her aunt's New England hometown are as ill-tempered as her aunt. But Pollyanna's incurable optimism - exemplified by her \"glad game\", in which she looks for the bright side of every situation - brings a change to the staid old community."
