    "overview": "The Päätalo film tells the story of Kalle Päätalo, a carpenter and master builder, and his burning desire to become a writer, as well as the long road that led to the creation of Päätalo's first novel. Too much hard work, too little love in his marriage, and too little self-confidence prevent Kalle Päätalo from realizing his lifelong dream of becoming a writer. Until he finds new love."
