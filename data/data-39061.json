    "overview": "A collection of seven stories \"from the block,\" linked by the theme of the seven deadly sins, humorously portrays the everyday life of New Belgrade's inhabitants, who are consumed by their minor foibles and guided by their passions. While pride, sloth, envy, wrath, greed, lust, and gluttony are biblical sins, they seem almost ridiculous in contemporary times when set against the backdrop of civilization's far more severe challenges."
