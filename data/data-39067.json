    "overview": "Described as \"Angela Carter rewriting La Belle et la Bête as an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer\", the story follows, through a tapestry of dreamlike images, a girl (Sarah Livingston Evans) and her three friends—the characters' names are never revealed—as they find themselves stranded in a dark and surreal forest by someone—or something (Edward Gusts)—who has obsessively loved, watched, and waited for the girl ever since childhood."
