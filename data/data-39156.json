    "overview": "Velko, Filip, Pavel and Gosho have different professions but are connected by the love they have for music. They rehearse all year to make it big on the sea resorts in the summer. The head of the cultural center where they play is willing to give them the musical equipment if they replace their singer Maria (Filip's girlfriend) with the attractive but untalented Reni. This is the first, but not the last compromise they have to make on the way to the dream."
