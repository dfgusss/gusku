    "overview": "The story takes the battle of the sexes into the hockey arena, as Paula Taymore – who almost once made the Olympic team – finds herself drawn into a challenge match against an irritating local men's squad. Fresh from a painful divorce, and doubting herself, Paula must make a winner out of an explosive, irreverent crew of women hockey players who flock to her town, Red Deer Alberta, to assemble the team."
