    "overview": "A man from Ostfriesland travels to Hamburg and sets course for America on a steamship to conquer this New World as well. What he leaves behind is a swath of devastation, a breach of confusion, a Milky Way full of music, a dead end full of mad jokes and perhaps a touch too much wordplay at the expense of others. But what is worst of all: he has also made a film about it!"
