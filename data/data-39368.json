    "overview": "Following his great success with \"North by Northwest,\" director Alfred Hitchcock makes a daring choice for his next project: an adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel \"Psycho.\" When the studio refuses to back the picture, Hitchcock decides to pay for it himself in exchange for a percentage of the profits. His wife, Alma Reville, has serious reservations about the film but supports him nonetheless. Still, the production strains the couple's marriage."
