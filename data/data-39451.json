Everything is going along just perfectly until J. Edgar trips and loses the last five magical balloons in all of Lovelyloveville--OH NO! The Oogiloves set out to find the magical balloons in time to save their friend's party. Along the way, they meet some very interesting characters indeed, including Dotty Rounder, Bobby Wobbly, Milky Marvin, Rosalie Rosebud and Lola and Lero Sombero. Can these new friends help them recover the magical balloons and get back to the cottage in time to celebrate Schluufy's surprise birthday?"
