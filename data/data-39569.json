    "overview": "A summery, boozy road movie in which Leo aimlessly drives a group of aging teddy bears through the Finnish countryside in a red Cadillac. The film centers on the bromance of middle-aged men, booze, and pizza, which they decide to order to their moving car. Not even a Russian truck driver, Stakes' alcohol recommendations, or the police can stop this gang."
