    "overview": "Brian is a private school student who routinely lends his van out so fellow students can have sex in it. When he is invited to become friends with Tony, the school's big man on campus, he hopes to get some romantic pointers so that he might use his van himself with dream girl Suzie. Things become more complicated, however, when he discovers Tony is sleeping with Suzie himself."
