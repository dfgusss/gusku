He finally persuades a devious local impresario to book him, but only on the condition that Juan first manages to spend an evening with Olimpia, a \"shrewd merciless beauty\" who seems effortlessly to collect apartments and Maserati sports cars while leaving a trail of broken hearts behind her. Juan approaches the challenge by pretending to her he is an emissary for a rich count. Written by Jeremy Perkins"
