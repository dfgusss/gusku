    "overview": "To celebrate his 90th birthday, an old single journalist, Sabio, wants something special from Rosa Cabarcas’s brothel: an intense night of love with a virgin teenager. The madam finds him the ideal young woman, Delgadina, a factory worker, who is selling her virginity to support her family. When he sees Delgadina sleeping angelically, he loses interest in pure pleasure and falls in love with her. That love was not meant to be true, but fate changes, and that hope is born of an opportunity for unbridled love."
