    "overview": "Pip thought he had it all, a pampered lifestyle, huge mansion and adoring owners, that is until the Taylor family booked an African safari. Pip finds himself separated from his clan, which forces him to reluctantly adapt to a new way of life in the jungle. As he bridges the divide between feuding wildlife he learns that caviar and manicures can never bring the same happiness as friendship."
