    "overview": "Dave and Tim are looking forward to the ultimate spring break vacation - string bikinis, wet t-shirt contests, killer babes, raging dudes, and lots of partying. But before their feet even hit the beach, they lose their money, car, and hotel room! All seems lost until a stunning private investigator hires them to \"research\" 50 sorority girls and find the one with the hidden birthmark. The race in on to beat the deadline and receive a reward most guys only fantasize about!"
