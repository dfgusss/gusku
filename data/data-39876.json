    "overview": "The tale of a group of women (a sweet old lady, her religious niece, her servant and the latter's disabled mother), all so generous and selfless that they almost compete with one another as ferocious rivals to see who can help most and make the greatest sacrifice for the others' wellbeing. And we all know the well-known saying: 'The road to hell is paved with good intentions'."
