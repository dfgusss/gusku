    "overview": "Hannibal is a nice and polite boy, but Father and Mother think he hangs too much in front of the television. They therefore give him the dog Jerry, whom he is very pleased with. It turns out that Jerry, as the dog is called, is not an ordinary dog, because it can not bark, but on the other hand it can speak. The crafty toy maker Uncle Grandfather and his henchman Uncle Harry would like to grab Jerry, and it involves various conflicts involving a cheeky dog trader, an unlucky glazier and a distinct police cops."
