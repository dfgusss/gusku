    "overview": "A desperate young couple, on the run from the mob, drop anchor at a remote rundown restaurant in the middle of the desert named the Nautilus. At first, it seems like a great place to hideout but soon they find themselves smack dab in the centre of a family that gives a whole new definition to the word crazy and makes them think that maybe they'd be better off with the mob."
