    "overview": "In the summer of 1995, as every year, the patients and staff of \"La Borde\" psychiatric clinic rehearse their summer play for a performance on August 15th. The film records the ups and downs of the venture as rehearsals go by. Yet, it also delicately captures the day-to-day existence, the seemingly insignificant details, the loneliness and the fatigue but also the collective joy and the close attention that all these people pay to each other."
