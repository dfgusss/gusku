    "overview": "Eddie Brennan is a down-and out fighter with nowhere to go but up... and with just the right combination of guts and spirit to become a winner. Once a contender, Brennan is now a washed-up has-been living in a fantasy world halfway between the dreams of his glory days and the dreams of a comeback. And when a set-up fight disguised as a legitimate bout comes his way, he jumps at the chance. No one thinks Eddie can win... least of all his trainer. No one wants Eddie to win... especially the crooked promoters. But Eddie's got something to prove to them all... and to himself. And he'll do anything to show that he's got the heart it takes to be a winner."
