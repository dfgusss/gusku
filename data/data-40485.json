Not wanting to let go of their carefree student lives or their friendship, they plan to hitchhike to Holland, where they've arranged to work on a farm for three months. But Vojta, Iska's little brother and her father's right hand man, joins the trio against their will. He becomes a witness as well as a catalyst for the breakup of their friendship - for the girls recognize that time cannot be stopped. Dolls is a story about searching for love and finding oneself in the volatile time of late adolescence."
