    "overview": "In 1969, with Sven Nykvist as cinematographer, Ingmar Bergman made The Fårö Document, a film that ended with a rather pessimist view of the island’s future. One of the scenes in the film is of a school-bus and its young passengers. To these and to the realities ten years later Bergman returns in the long documentary Fårö Document 1979."
