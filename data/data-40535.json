    "overview": "Based on the acclaimed play that the Independent of London hailed as \"a bracingly uncensored exploration of the tensions and treacheries in a beleaguered male subculture\", PONIES is about three men in a treacherous subset of society, and uses the gambling parlor as a backdrop for a provocative modern morality tale. Ultimately, these men-immigrants, Americans, human beings-are forced to protect from one another their most valuable commodity: the right to stay on American soil."
