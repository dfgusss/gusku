After Emily arranges a house-swap with Charles, an English professor from Boston who wants Washington State’s solitude in order to finish his novel, Emily hops on a flight to Boston to surprise Heather for Christmas. Unaware of the house swap, Emily’s best friend, Faith walks in on Charles at Emily’s house and in Boston, Ray, Charles’ brother responds to a 911 call only to find Emily at Charles’ condo.
