    "overview": "Walter Speckman is a nobody, until one day he is struck by lightning and gains the ability to move any object with his mind... but only for 3 inches at a time. A recruiter who knows of super-powered individuals finds Walter and offers him the chance to use his powers to do good... and join with a team of other people with similar abilities. Walter accepts, but soon discovers that \"good\" and \"evil\" aren't as easy to differentiate as he thought."
