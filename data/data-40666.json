Blaming herself when a crisis she’s handling goes wrong and a young man is killed, she removes herself from service. But she is called back into sudden and terrifying action when her own sister becomes a hostage and the assailants—with an agenda to be revealed—demand that Cameron be the one to negotiate her release."
