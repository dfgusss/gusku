    "overview": "The lacking attitude of a conscripted university graduate places him at odds with the power and doctrine of his military superiors. His secret relationship with the wife of a superior officer along with the low discipline of his fellow conscripts only heightens the disrespect towards the new post world war two communist regime. The first privately produced movie in Czech Republic."
