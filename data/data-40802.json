    "overview": "Unfolding in a secluded Polish village 'Z daleka widok jest piekny' (It looks pretty from a distance) is a love story between a scrapper and a young woman. Seen through the monotony of everyday life the film depicts the hardships of a rural community in present-day Poland. The bucolic landscape becomes the seemingly idyllic backdrop from which a sudden disappearance disrupts their once quiet community."
