    "overview": "The upright prof. Filippo Bottini Said Pippo is an \"old-fashioned\" teacher in a Roman school. He would like a Heart book-style school but clashes with the harsh reality of modern teaching and in particular with the turmoil of the seventies: strikes, occupations, armed students, feminist colleagues. Overwhelmed by events, he will find himself more and more in the maelstrom of the post-1968 protest until he becomes a drug courier. He will be arrested and incarcerated, but thanks to the release on bail provided by his colleague Lalla, with whom he had in the meantime started a relationship, he will be able to redeem himself."
