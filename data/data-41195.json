    "overview": "Traxx has battled his way through El Salvador, the Middle East and Nicaragua, spitting lead with two-handed good grace. He decides to retire to a life of baking designer cookies. Running out of dough to buy more dough, he hires himself as a \"Town Tamer\" and begins cleaning up Hadleyville, Texas, telling the lowlife street scum, \"You got three choices. Be good, be gone, or be dead.\" Like all bacteria, the scum are resistant: crime boss Aldo Palucci brings in the dreaded Guzik brothers to rid the town of the town tamer, setting the stage for a showdown in the streets."
