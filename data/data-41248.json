    "overview": "Chantel Mitchell, a hip, articulate, black high-school girl in Brooklyn, is determined not to become \"just another girl on the IRT\" (the IRT is one of NYC's subway lines). She dreams of medical school, a family, and an escape from the generational poverty and street-corner life her friends seem to have accepted as their lot. But personal and sexual challenges confront Chantel on her way to fulfilling these dreams."
