    "overview": "In an Argentine village in the 1930s, the willful Leonor discovers that her beloved daughter, Charlotte, has dwarfism. Attempting to let her have as normal a childhood as possible, Leonor never discusses Charlotte's lack of stature, nor lets anyone else in the village ever mention it. As Charlotte grows up into a smart and self-possessed young woman, local eccentric Ludovico, who collects miniatures, becomes smitten with her."
