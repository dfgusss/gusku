    "overview": "Trojan Eddie sells stolen goods for John Power, aging godfather of a local network of Irish gypsies, known as \"travelers.\" Having done time rather than inform on his partner in a failed burglary, Eddie now struggles to raise his two daughters alone. Power falls for and marries traveler girl Kathleen, but when she runs off with Power's nephew Dermot — and takes the $11,000 dowry with her — Eddie must track the couple down."
