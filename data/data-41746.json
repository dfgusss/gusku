    "overview": "Zac is an idealistic student who, after arriving at college, decides to pledge the Gamma Nu Pi fraternity. Unhappy with what he sees as the bigotry and abusiveness of the hazing process, he tries to reform the system, even though his steady girl, Jennifer, doesn't approve. Zac eventually finds an ally in his pledgemaster, but the head of the fraternity proves cruelly inflexible about preserving the uglier rituals."
