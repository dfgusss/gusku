This critically acclaimed film explores the lifestyle, rites, myths and passions of the tight-knit urban subculture. Twelve year-old Angelo Evans is the street-wise. Charmingly precocious son of a fortune teller. When the boy accuses a sleazy Romani, Steve \"Patalay\" Tsigonoff, and his foul-mouthed wife, Millie, of stealing an ancestral ring, he chases them to Canada. Angelo wants the ring for his future bride, Patricia, and nearly disgraces the family to get it back. Along the way, Duvall presents an extraordinary slice of Romani life, highlighting there music and tribal customs, a wedding and a \"kris\" - the Romani court of justice. His film has a spontaneity and exuberance that make it a one-of-a-kind experience."
