    "overview": "Facing an imminent attack from Mars, planet Earth sends Dibu to Mars as a peace ambassador -- the only hope for averting the attack. Amazingly, he finds a friendly population, whose only issue is that they are fed up of their planet being used as a nuclear dump site. Besides averting the Martian attack, Dibu also inadvertently manages the save hit planet from the diabolical designs of an ambitious general"
