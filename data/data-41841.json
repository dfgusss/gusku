    "overview": "The Webster Family enjoyed the good life of weekend shopping sprees, nice cars and a beautiful home. Matt Webster was respected by his peers and envied as the man who had it all. But when hard times came, having it all on the outside did not mean there is anything on the inside. Broken relationships, isolation and pain are the result of their misplaced priorities, selfishness and pride. In their chaos the Webster family will soon discover the American dream and pride of ownership does not build character. It took a financial crisis to show Matt that all things work together for good… to those who Stand Strong in Faith."
