    "overview": "Rich bachelor B.G. Bruno, the head of a successful greeting-card company in Scotland, is essentially a kind man but respectable to the point of stodginess and extreme stuffiness. An American troupe visiting Edinburgh wants to produce a musical in town but has trouble getting financiers. Bruno meets several leading ladies; through a misunderstanding, he doesn't correct their impression that he's a newspaper reporter."
