    "overview": "Arthur Lipsett's first film is an avant-garde blend of photography and sound. It looks behind the business-as-usual face we put on life and shows anxieties we want to forget. It is made of dozens of pictures that seem familiar, with fragments of speech heard in passing and, between times, a voice saying, \"Very nice, very nice.\" The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film."
