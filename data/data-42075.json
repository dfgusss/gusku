    "overview": "In reality Emil and Larissa would never have been a couple she is an idolized singer, he is a shy outsider. Ironically, Emil is just getting to know Larissa when she dies unexpectedly. He pretends to have been her boyfriend and finally gets the recognition he has always yearned for, with the added bonus of a surrogate family in the form of Larissas. Things would be just great if Emil didnt fall in love - with Larissas sister Nora. The more he gets to know her, the harder it becomes for him to pretend."
