    "overview": "Eight people on a journey across Germany. Each has a destination in mind, each has worries as well as wishes. Fate brings them together. The carpooling agency throws them together in three cars. They have to spend several hours together in a very confined space. A shy wallflower, a pushy swimwear salesman, a boy who wants to get out of the provinces for a weekend... Their lives become intertwined for a few hours during the trip. But how do such different people fit together at all? This question is the source of the movie's suspense."
