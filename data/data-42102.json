    "overview": "In 1994, three filmmakers went into the woods to film a documentary about the legendary Blair Witch. They disappeared and have never been found…  But the film grossed a lot of money.  How come? We don't know...  In 2000, three more filmmakers went into the woods to find out what happened to the three unfortunate filmmakers...  They also disappeared...  But what did all these people do?  A collection of short films by filmmakers searching for their \"Witch\" in an attempt to imitate the 1999 blockbuster."
