    "overview": "Set in a Shinjuku bathhouse brothel,  the film uncovers the sexual eccentricities of everyday people.  Focusing on three female prostitutes, the colorful, unpredictable look into the hidden underbelly of Japanese nightlife is playful but also unafraid to explore the darker sides of the business. The fleeting nature of relationships in such an environment and the consequences of toying with feelings are presented with a melancholy tinge."
