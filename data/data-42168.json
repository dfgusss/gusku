    "overview": "Tommy, a dogged lab tech of industrial food who, though once known in the business as \"The Apostate\", seems to have rededicated himself to producing scientifically engineered meat. A film about a dystopian future rife with genetic engineering, corporate corruption of government and rampant infection, is really about Tommy’s loneliness and the at-home experiment he conducts."
