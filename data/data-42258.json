    "overview": "A campy low-budget sequel to 1971's cult classic gore-fest with an interplanetary sub-plot grafted on.  The giant flesh-mangling meat grinder in the basement of the Lotus Cat Food Company is back in business under new management. And this time the popular \"food for cats who like people\" has drawn the attention of an alien race of intelligent felines from the planet Ceta. The Cetans' food supply has been destroyed in their interplanetary war with dog-headed dinosaurs. With help from the U.S. government's \"men in black\" the cat queen, Felina, negotiates a mega-deal with the Lotus Company to supply her planet with food. This sudden increase in orders has the new owners scrambling for fresh - and not-so-fresh- human flesh to meet the growing demand."
