    "overview": "An epic, 20-minute, completely fabricated theatrical trailer for a crypto-Vestron Video cheapie (by way of Willow-era Ron Howard)—a supposedly 18-hour movie about a Jeff Daniels lookalike demon sent to destroy the planet (and possibly the universe) with his \"Turbo-power!\" Olds dragster. There are shades of John Carpenter's They Live, caffeinated Evil Dead speed-freakery, a cameo by Miles O'Keeffe, and uncanny movie preview clichés, such as sentence prepositions that never reach a resolution: \"On an alien planet…the beauty and wisdom of a sorceress….\" Sometimes the liner note blurbs speak for themselves: \"Damon Packard is to Stephen Spielberg what George Kuchar is to Douglas Sirk.\""
