    "overview": "The film aims to reveal what the general public has been unable to see: the modest and mysterious inner world of Jari Litmanen. In addition to reviewing the stages of the great soccer player and \"artist's\" own life, the film also examines the experiences and thoughts of other people connected to his life, such as his teammates and supporters, about Jari Litmanen, soccer, and life itself."
