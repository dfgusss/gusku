    "overview": "A young farm maid overhears two cow-hands talking in the barn, and she becomes convinced they’re about to rob her. She barricades herself in a room and calls the police. Her call wakes the chief, who rallies the country justice constabulary and they set off toward the farm, in steam-car and on foot. Meanwhile, the maiden’s parents rush to save her. Everything points toward a showdown in the barn, where no one, including the police force, will be cowed."
