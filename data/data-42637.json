    "overview": "Raúl Arévalo and Miguel García seem like a drop of water to another, but there the similarity ends. Raul is a famous singer, womanizer, despotic, cruel and millionaire. Instead Michael is an honest worker, cheerful and loving who enjoys the simple things forward. Fate will know them and life will never be the same for either."
