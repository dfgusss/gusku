    "overview": "Cimrman sees the reason for the popularity of the Blanik legend in Bohemia mainly in the geographical location of our homeland. In agreement with Palacký, he was aware that \"we are here in Europe like a grain between two millstones. From the west, German imperialism presses upon us, and from the east, the expansionism of the Great Russian colossus crushes us. It is no wonder that a small nation under such pressure seeks supernatural and even miraculous protection, for only a miracle can enable it to survive here.\""
