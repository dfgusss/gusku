    "overview": "A man suffers a minor car accident, and a week later constructs a new identity, claiming he can't \"remember\" being a father. Nearly twenty years later, his amnesia persists, yet no brain damage or physical cause are ever found. Enthralling and thought-provoking, \"Forgetting Dad\" offers an award-winning case study of dissociation, parental abandonment, and family enmenshment in mental illness."
