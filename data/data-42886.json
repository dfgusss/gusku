    "overview": "Alice is your typical modern woman, juggling her demanding roles as a mother of twins, a loving wife and a successful career woman. She struggles to keep all the balls in the air, until the day it all becomes too much for one person to handle and she splits into three separate versions of herself — each stepping in to take over part of her life. While at first the new Alices are perfect as the ultimate sexy wife, super mommy, and ultra-focused executive, Alice soon realizes that her whole self may be far greater than just her parts. She needs to get herself back together, and quickly."
