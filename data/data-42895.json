    "overview": "Based on the popular television series Okresní přebor. As the title suggests, the film features the legendary figure of licensed coach Josef Hnátek. Since this man appeared in the series only as ashes scattered on the Houslice football field, the filmmakers decided to introduce him to viewers in his living form. The story of the feature film is set during his lifetime and explores the dilemma of a man for whom football is his whole life. Even more than life itself. The title role of the Houslice personality will be played by theater director, artistic director of Prague's Dejvické Theater, and occasional actor Miroslav Krobot."
