    "overview": "The dogs of Doverville are in trouble again... but Emma O'Conner is back to save them in a song-filled, seasonal extravaganza. Mean-spirited mogul Finneas James plots to shut down the local puppy orphanage, unless Emma can come up with the money to save it. With the help of some friends, she races against time to put together a musical holiday event that just might save the day."
