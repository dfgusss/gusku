In the photo, Hero recognizes his grandfather, who everyone thought was dead. He asks his former lover, the French cultural attaché, to find out. It turns out that he has an inheritance waiting for him in Paris for many years. The guardian of the inheritance turns out to be a high-ranking Freemason who tells him the story of his grandfather, gives him the winnings and involves him in a Masonic conspiracy."
