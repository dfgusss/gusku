    "overview": "Elias of the 16th Precinct follows three friends – Elias, Thomas and Vangelis – who face considerable financial hurdles with their debts rivalling the size of Everest. They decide the only solution is to snatch money from Vangelis’ boss, Labros ; a cafeteria owner, pawnbroker and fence. While Thomas will attempt the breaking and entering, Elias will be disguised as a police officer – for security reasons, of course. Hilarity ensues as this comedy of errors sends their plan spiralling off in a totally different direction."
