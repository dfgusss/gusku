When the Kilrathi capture a crucial navigational device that could lead them to Earth, the Confederation’s only hope rests with a small group of young fighter pilots. Lieutenant Christopher Blair, along with his wingman Todd 'Maniac' Marshall and Commander Jeanette 'Angel' Deveraux, must intercept the alien fleet and prevent the destruction of mankind. Battling overwhelming odds and racing against time, they face not only external threats but also inner fears and rivalries as they fight to save Earth from annihilation."
