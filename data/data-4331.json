With Plunkett's criminal know-how and Macleane's social connections, they team up to be soon known as \"The Gentlemen Highwaymen\". But when one day these gentlemen hold up Lord Chief Justice Gibson's coach, Macleane instantly falls in love with his beautiful and cunning niece, Lady Rebecca Gibson. Unfortunately, Thief Taker General Chance, who also is quite fond of Rebecca, is getting closer and closer to getting both."
