    "overview": "The Dutch supervillain Freek van Dyk is keeping the world on tenterhooks - and the world's best secret services can only stand by and watch. Finally, the Turkish Ayran Secret Service intervenes. However, there is a mix-up, because after two of the ASS men are eliminated, ASS head Süleyman is looking for a \"Süper agent\" and mistakes the clueless Indian cleaner Ranjid for one. He actually just wants to cure his sick cow, but suddenly has to save the world."
