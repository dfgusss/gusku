    "overview": "On New Year's Eve, accompanied by a bottle of champagne, Emile, 35 years old, signs up to Meet Me, a famous Internet dating site, with a good resolution for the new year: to find love. There are many men on Meet Me: cynics, comics, a few oddballs, and even great romantics. Emilie is far from imagining what is waiting for her in real life."
