    "overview": "“Rising from Ashes” is a feature length documentary about the ﬁrst Rwandan National Cycling Team and their six year journey to the Olympic games in London. It's not about the bike. It's about second chances, how our past doesn't have to deﬁne our future, and the impossible triumph of the human spirit over one of the world's most devastating genocides."
