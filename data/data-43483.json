    "overview": "As lead singer of 1980s British indie band Felt, Lawrence acquired a cult following. In the '90s he went on to form Denim and later Go Kart Mozart.  Paul Kelly's intimate documentary film follows Lawrence between Go Kart Mozart albums. He appears as, perhaps, he always has: a man out of time and a confused, confusing genius."
