    "overview": "Filmed before Wall Street's October 1987 crash, this film is a riveting one hour documentary of a fascinating man, Paul Tudor Jones II delivering a rarely seen view of futures trading and an explanation of the workings of this frantic, highly charged marketplace. It also examines Jones' prediction that America is nearing the end of a 200-year bull market."
