    "overview": "\"Everybody's Got Somebody... Not Me\" - Alejandra is sick of her daily life and her past relationships that have not worked out. Then she meets María, an adolescent, with whom she has an affair. At first everything runs smoothly, however Alejandra´s personality and her emotional needs prove increasingly demanding; being around her becomes unbearable. At this point, they ask themselves whether they should continue the oppressive relationship, or go on with their ordinary lives."
