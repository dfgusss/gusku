    "overview": "Peppermint Patty is in zealous training for a figure skating competition, but with no help from her grumpy coach, Snoopy. He growls coaching tips that don't make sense, and Marcie can't sew the dress Peppermint Patty is dying to wear. Still determined to win, Peppermint Patty turns to Woodstock when disaster looms at the competition."
