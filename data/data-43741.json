    "overview": "Pathé film number 380, also known as \"What Happened to the Inquisitive Janitor\" (US) and \"Peeping Tom\" (UK). It should not be confused with its remake from 1905 also titled What is Seen Through a Keyhole, a film now considered lost.  As a janitor is cleaning a hotel, he decides to peek through the keyholes to observe some of the guests in their rooms. In room 8, a woman is busy making herself look more attractive, and the janitor enjoys watching her. There are also some interesting things going on in the other rooms on the floor."
