He is able to transfer other people's injuries and is unable to walk past a child with a grazed knee or broken arm without helping them. Asato is protected from street thugs by Takeo, another troubled young man who has issues involving his father who is lying in a coma in hospital. The third member of their group is a young waitress, Shiho, who has her own secret."
