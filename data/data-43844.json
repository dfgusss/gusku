    "overview": "In post-war Armenia, physicist Artyom buries himself in work, haunted by the loss of his wife in WWII, unable to let go of the past. Meanwhile, young Tanya refuses to accept her stepfather, still waiting for her real father, missing in action for years. Their parallel journeys explore memory, loss, and the weight of history—both personal and national. As Artyom grapples with the dilemma of remembering versus forgetting, the film becomes a meditation on identity, time, and the inescapable pull of the past. Partially based on the life of prominent Soviet-Armenian scientist Artem Alikhanyan, Hello, It’s Me! is a deeply reflective exploration of history’s grip on both individuals and nations."
