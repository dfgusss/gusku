    "overview": "How to become a star? Thorny path to Olympus. Young Zoya Misochkina in the backyard of the provincial town \"Lokotki\" meets two producers, Pridorozhnyy and Bolotov, from whom the prima donna Irma has just fled. Zoya passionately wants to sing, so she joins in with new acquaintances and finds herself in a large apartment with two seemingly serious gentlemen, and with close acquaintance, half-crazy touching clowns. Zoya's life turns upside down. Vocal lessons, beauty salons, gyms, presentations, all this should turn an unknown nondescript girl into a new pop star."
