Many began to look after her, but the girl was not a timid dozen and quickly gave a turn to the unlucky boyfriends from the gate. However, true love found a way to her heart, and although human envy and stupidity have done many troubles, the lovers still managed to unravel this complex tangle of misunderstandings."
