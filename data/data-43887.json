    "overview": "Vasily Gubanov, the son of the film “The Communist”’s hero, arrived in Moscow not on call or for a business trip. Instead, he came to raise the issue with government authorities about halting the construction of a chemical plant. Despite being the author of the project, which was in full swing, millions of state funds had been spent, and thousands of people’s lives were tied to its completion."
