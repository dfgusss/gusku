    "overview": "The police station used to be the army club during the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. Many Japanese officers committed hara kiri there on V-J Day. The old building thus became a ghost house. Petty thief Ming is detained in the basement. It is the Ghost Festival when ghosts are allowed one night's leave. The Colonel shows up and bites Ming, who becomes a vampire."
