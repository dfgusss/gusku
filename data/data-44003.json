    "overview": "A brand new live DVD from the brilliant comedian - coming in 2012. Recorded at his last ever tour.  Frankie Boyle has been pilloried, misrepresented and demonised. And for what? For Telling It Like It Is. Now he will attempt a final tour, to heal Britain's fools. To support its rioters. To offer the inchoate laughter of despair to a culture in freefall. These are The Last Days Of Sodom."
