    "overview": "Inexperienced in love and living in Los Angeles, aspiring actress Claire longs to find that special someone. Unfortunately, she couldn't pick a more undeserving guy when she starts a relationship with womanizer Chad. Although her friend April warns her about him, it's not as if April doesn't have problems of her own -- namely a chronic inability to stay faithful to her longtime boyfriend, Neal."
