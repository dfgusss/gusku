    "overview": "A journey back in time in the form of a cartoon with characterizations of the Trapalhões, from the time of the Roman Empire to the present day, through the Middle Ages, the Old West and the First World War. They begin the film by doing a stand-up show at the Teatro Scala, in Rio de Janeiro, receiving on stage the designer Mauricio de Sousa. From then on, the story unfolds in a cartoon, in which Os Trapalhões is chased by an evil wizard whose aim is to try to hold Didi's (always unsuccessful) hand to rule the world during the passage of the famous Halley Comet."
