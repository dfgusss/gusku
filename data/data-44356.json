    "overview": "Kamel, a young Bedouin, is a proud security guard at the Be’er Sheba central bus station. When the Israeli government threatens to tear down his settlement he decides to act. Kamel comes up with a plan to stage a bomb attack, which he will then prevent from happening, making him the hero of the day, hopefully saving his settlement and earning him the respect he's so desperately yearning for."
