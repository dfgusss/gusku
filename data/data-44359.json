    "overview": "Popeye sails to Goon Island in search of his Pappy. He finds the place populated by the imposing, but ugly, goons, and a \"no humans\" sign. His imprisoned pappy at first ignores him, but when Popeye is caught by the goons and carried off, his can of spinach lands near Pappy and it works just as well on him as it does on Popeye."
