    "overview": "A cross-cut of nearly 100 years of American movies. We see the most precious film sequences that we all remember: From Citizen Kane to Star Wars, from Some Like It Hot to E.T. The incredible short cuts of roughly a second each push the audience into a kind of trance and take them on a journey into their individual memories of great films of the 20th century. The film won an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film."
