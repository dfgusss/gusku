Against the advice of friends and family, not to mention his own better judgment, Tomek returns home to face the man he hardly knows. After a failed, guilt-ridden attempt to sell his father’s apartment, Tomek decides to make up for lost time. Kidnapping his aging father from the hospital, the two embark on a vacation to the mountains in an effort to restore some semblance of a relationship."
