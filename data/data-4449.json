    "overview": "The film mainly consists of various, often grotesque episodes. There is also a frame story from which the episodes are derived. However, the connection between the frame story and the episodes is very weak. Many episodes revolve around surveillance and security. In the frame story, insurance agent Erich and Richard are stuck together in an elevator that is unusually large for an apartment building (about 3x3 meters). While Erich wants to get out as quickly as possible, Richard isn't actually in any hurry, as he seems to live in the elevator."
