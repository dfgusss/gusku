    "overview": "It's a sun-soaked holiday season for the Bannister family as they travel to Southern California to stay with Aunt Barbara, who surprises them with a new puppy named Eve. Everyone is smitten with Eve -- except for the Bannister's dog, Zeus, who sees what a mischievous animal she is when no one else is around. After deciding to run away, Zeus sees Ted and Stewey, two thrifty thieves, trying to break into the family home while the Bannisters are at church. It's up to Zeus and his newest sister Eve to join together to save the holidays for their family!"
