    "overview": "De Düva is a 1968 Oscar-nominated American short film that parodies the films of Swedish director Ingmar Bergman, including Wild Strawberries and The Seventh Seal.  The film borrows heavily from the plot lines of some of Bergman's most famous films. The dialogue, seemingly in Swedish, is actually a Swedish-accented fictional language based on English, German, Latin, and Swedish, with most nouns ending in \"ska.\" The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Live Action Short Film."
