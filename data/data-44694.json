    "overview": "A single middle aged lady working as receptionist and cleaner in a public lavatory for men spends her time between chores reading \"Happy Woman\" and daydreaming about a loving partner. When an unknown man starts leaving flowers at her desk, she gets excited but also increasingly stressed out trying to figure out who is her secret admirer or, perhaps, the prankster."
