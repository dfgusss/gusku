    "overview": "We do not live in the physical world! Where we really live is in the invisible world of experience. It is in this world, and only in this world, that we have infinite possibilities, and are safe and at peace at all times. As long as we don't realize that this is the world in which we truly live, not only does nothing in metaphysics make any sense, but no matter what we do, what methods we use, what systems we follow, we will not achieve what it is we truly want."
