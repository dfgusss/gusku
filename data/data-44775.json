    "overview": "A young captain demobilized from the army, in search of a better life, comes to Moscow. All attempts to earn money honestly for housing and food end in failure. In addition, he owes a large sum to his comrade in the military school, who has long abandoned the army and is successfully dancing striptease in one of the capital's clubs. To pay back the debt, the hero agrees to work in a striptease and from that moment becomes a professional gigolo."
