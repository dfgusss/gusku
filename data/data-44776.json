    "overview": "Just in time for the joyous holiday season, this film connects the ancient Mayan prophecy of worldwide destruction at the end of 2012, and the iconic holiday song, The 12 Days of Christmas. But there is hope: a father learns that his daughter is really the \"Chosen One\" who, alone, can stop further catastrophe - if he can stave off the lunatic townspeople blaming her for the community's destruction."
