    "overview": "This celebrated director's \"exquisite cruelty\" appears front and center when the death of a stage actor turns a theatrical drama into a real one. Two in One's two parts, \"Stagehands\" and \"Woman of a Lifetime,\" celebrate the psychological richness that lurks just beneath the surface of banal reality - if murderous stagehands, lascivious fathers and vengeful daughters can be described as banal."
