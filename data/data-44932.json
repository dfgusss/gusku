    "overview": "In the 1920s, the rights of American workers to join a labor union was still considered an open question, and African-Americans were routinely denied their civil and economic rights.  10,000 Black Men Named George, the title, refers to the fact Pullman porters were often called \"George\" by white passengers, which was considered a racial slur."
