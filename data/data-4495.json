Benji falls head over heels in love with new girl Tammy but manages to ruin the relationship by pushing her to go all the way. Benji is the object of Martha's affections, even though she is dating Huey, and as usual Bobby is finding it hard to stay faithful to just one girl! Going Stead is set against a backdrop of sunlit beaches, moonlit nights... and Rock 'n' Roll!"
