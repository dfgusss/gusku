    "overview": "It is the story of the brilliant football player Cotechiño, hired by the Napoli team as a centre-forward. Too bad that his professional career will be strongly influenced by the frequent absence of his fiancée, for which he feels an inexplicable, almost obsessive jealousy. That's why he hires a plumber very similar to him to keep an eye on his beloved, but that won't be enough when Cotechiño is kidnapped."
