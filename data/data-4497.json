    "overview": "The Lemon Popsicle boys - Bobby, Benji, and Huey - have been drafted into the army, but they're not quite ready to give up the freedom they've enjoyed for so long and submit to army discipline. They spend most of their time chasing women, trying to get out of doing any work and avoiding their no-nonsense sergeant."
