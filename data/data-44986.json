    "overview": "\"A film portrait cut to the tune of Conway Twitty's version of 'Mona Lisa.' Filmed in part at a 1964 show of Conner's artwork in San Francisco, the film is also a witty statement about forces that take the life out of art. Vivian Kurz, the subject of the film, is entombed in a glass display case.\" - Judd Chesler  Award: Gold Medal Award, Sesta Biennale D'Arte Republica Di San Marino.
