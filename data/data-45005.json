    "overview": "A short film documenting what was referred to as \"The International Poetry Incarnation\". It was billed as Great Britain's first full-scale \"happening\", with the world's leading Beat poets together under one roof at the Royal Albert Hall on June 11, 1965, for an evening of near-hallucinatory revelry. It came to be seen as one of the cultural high points of the Swinging Sixties."
