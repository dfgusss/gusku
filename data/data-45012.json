The Mystery Inc. pals -- Fred, Daphne, Velma, Shaggy and Scooby -- head to the annual convention, but they're not there to crack their next case. They want to meet their favorite comic book characters and see a megabucks movie premiere, an explosive big-screen remake of the classic cartoon The Adventures of Blue Falcon, featuring Shaggy and Scooby's favorite superheroes: caped avenger Blue Falcon and his trusty but bumbling robo-pup, Dynomutt."
