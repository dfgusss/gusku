    "overview": "Moments after receiving his graduate diploma, Jacob waits at a train station. The future lies ahead, but life abruptly intervenes. Images flash in Jacob's mind: of war, injustice, assassination, protest, the entire spectrum of 1960s angst and anger - sending Jacob into a catatonic state. What follows during his bizarre rehab and its aftermath will be another form of madness."
