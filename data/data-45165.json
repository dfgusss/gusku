    "overview": "Following an argument with his young protege, the curmudgeonly Dr. Gillespie dumps Jimmy Kildare in a street clinic, hoping to teach him a lesson.  While working there Kildare meets pretty nurse Mary Lamont, and ends up treating a hoodlum with a gunshot wound.  He purposely fails to write a report on it, and soon finds himself in a heap of trouble.  Who else would come to his rescue but good old Dr. Gillespie?"
