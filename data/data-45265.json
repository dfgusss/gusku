    "overview": "Some time ago three total strangers participated in a cheesecake commercial. A mother, a father and a son were simply having tea at a dinner table, but for the boy from a dysfunctional family the shot where they were eating a cake together became an obsession; he dreams about another “family” gathering at the same table. Alyosha does not care that his “mom”, Natalia, has been married for a long time, and that his “dad”, Mikhail, has a girlfriend."
