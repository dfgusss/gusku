    "overview": "The film tells the story of those who took part in the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942, which became a turning point in the Great Patriotic War. For five months, the city resisted the Nazi offensive. Surrendering Stalingrad to the enemy would have meant losing the war, but holding on to the city seemed almost impossible."
