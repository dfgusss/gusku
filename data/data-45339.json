    "overview": "Jullo, Edo, and Chiara: three teenagers among thousands. Three teenagers who live for sport. Jullo is his skateboard, Chiara conquers the world on skis, Edo is a graffiti artist. One day, Jullo, Chiara, and Edo suddenly discover their own lives, each in their own way. Fears, dreams, surprises, loneliness, insecurity, expectations, instability, imbalance. Then a moment, a second, a click. A click that leads them to rediscover themselves, that leads them into adulthood, or that relentlessly sweeps them away."
