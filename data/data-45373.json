    "overview": "The story of an Angel named Giordano, who, for his rascally conduct in Heaven (too frequent visits to Purgatory and his fascination with rock-and-roll), is sent to earth to do at least one good deed there every day. Giordano is supposed to land in \"Holland\", but by mistake he ends up in \"Poland\" (or more precisely: Krakow). His fresh outlook, sympathy for people and original thinking about the world help him, at the very beginning of his stay on Earth, to save a crumbling marriage."
