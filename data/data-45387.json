    "overview": "Globe-trotting Slovakian filmmaker Pavol Barabas explores Earth's biggest tropical island, New Guinea, in this breathtaking tour of a culture wholly unfamiliar with modern civilization and with no previous contact with white people. Along the way, Barabas finds people living high in trees under conditions roughly similar to those of the Stone Age. The film won the Culture Prize at the Kendal Mountain Film Festival."
