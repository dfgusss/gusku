    "overview": "Filmmaker and journalist Bruce Burgess (Broken Dagger) goes deep into the heart of the greatest secret of the 20th century: Area 51, or \"Dreamland\", in this award-winning documentary. Along with his camera crew, Burgess sets out to uncover the truth of what is really going on in the most secret military base in the world.  Originally a skeptic, Burgess was converted, and now he presents his findings here.  Footage of UFOs performing impossible maneuvers under cover of darkness.  Multiple aircraft flying over the base are only the beginning of this account of what goes on in a base that is roughly the size of Switzerland.  Learn about the unexplained deaths of Area 51 workers, government-funded Black Projects, abductions, and the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology. Dreamland goes beyond the perimeter wire, through the fields of motion sensors, past the armed patrols, jet fighters, and attack helicopters to uncover the truth of the greatest secret yet to be exposed."
