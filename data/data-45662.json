    "overview": "How independent are we in our judgments? How do other people influence us? Being like everyone else is a natural desire of a child. He often succumbs to suggestion and passes out someone else's opinion for his own. But for an adult, this is a loss of personality, adaptability, conformism, which forms the psychology of a slave."
