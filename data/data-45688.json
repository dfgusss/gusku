    "overview": "Mrs Bartolotti doesn’t really like children. She is therefore completely taken aback when she receives a son in the post: Konrad. Konrad is actually delivered in a tin! He is dreadfully tidy and almost perfect and Mrs Bartolotti is very chaotic. She actually becomes so fond of him, however, that she never wants to let go of him again, even if the weird people from the tin factory are already looking for him..."
