    "overview": "Lau Kar-leung returns to the success of his first directed film, \"The Spiritual Boxer,\" which also stars the original film's bumbling ghost controller, Wong Yu. Hoping to make the lightning of success strike in the same place, Lau had his two brothers Lau Kar-Wing and Gordon Liu not only act but also help with the fights. The end result is a martial arts film masterpiece filled with breathtaking action and set pieces."
