When the two are discovered cheating by their professor, the longed-for scholarship recommendation is withdrawn. Meanwhile the jealousy of Betty's boy friend has been aroused and when Marv learns that he can only hold the girl's affections by offering her riches, he plans a million dollar robbery. Even the professional gangsters with whom he works are amazed at the brilliance of the young genius. Again, however, he is double crossed by Betty who has warned her friend and his gang of the plan. When the police also learn of the activities the project as well as the lives of a number of the boys ends in tragedy."
