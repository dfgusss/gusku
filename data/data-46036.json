    "overview": "In 1941, an Irish documentary filmmaker hears of a man named J.C. Sullivan, who may know the fate of the Hollandia, a Norwegian ship that sailed to Antarctica in 1905 and disappeared. Sullivan was the carpenter on that ill-fated voyage and is the last known surviving crewmember of the Hollandia. When interviewed, Sullivan presents the filmmaker with canisters of old film footage which back up his unbelievable tale."
