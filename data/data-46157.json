    "overview": "Tony is a young crook preparing for a bank robbery with her boyfriend Juanjo and their low-life partners Maxi and Moco. Right before they commit the crime, Juanjo informs Tony that his prostitute sister wants him to take her young daughter Laura to visit the girl's father, a flamenco singer in the Spanish southern coastal town of Tarifa. Juanjo persuades the initially reluctant Tony that Laura will provide the couple with a perfect cover after they relieve their partners of the robbery's earnings. Unfortunately, though the robbery comes off without a hitch, the duplicitous Juanjo absconds with the cash, making Tony and Laura fugitives both from the law and from the psychotically angry Maxi and Moco."
