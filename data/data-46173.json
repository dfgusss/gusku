    "overview": "The portrait of a young girl from the Parisian bourgeoisie. As a brief shot indicates us, it could have been called \"Portrait of the artist as a young girl.\" though probably \"young girl\" is just a previous title, but the style and the presence of the Father leaves no doubt about who paints and who's hiding behind the young girl."
