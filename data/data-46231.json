    "overview": "The first film made by Don Levy is a comedic satire of pretensions and perversions of British academia. Made for the Cambridge Film Society, it is shot in grainy black-and-white scuffed up to resemble aged prints of 1920s Surrealist films and displays an astringent sense of the ironies that can be achieved through juxtapositions of image, voice-over text, and music."
