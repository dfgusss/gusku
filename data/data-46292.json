    "overview": "Micke is a total film nerd, who would be rather sitting home watching violent action movies than to be outside drinking and hanging out with friends. One night Micke has prepared to have an orgy of violent movies, but something rather strange interrupts his plans. While watching \"Die Hard\", one of the German terrorists from the film comes out of the television, and this launches a night of violence filled with known characters."
