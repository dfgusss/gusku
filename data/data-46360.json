    "overview": "One Night Stand is a funny, intimate, behind-the-scenes journey as top Broadway and Hollywood artists take the challenge to produce four original short musicals in 24 hours.  The film provides a personal glimpse of some of America's favorite actors as they step out of their comfort zones--from Cheyenne Jackson's \"fear, sweat, adrenaline and Red Bull\" to Rachel Dratch's mounting dread at the prospect of singing alongside Broadway's finest voices. Richard Kind sums it up: \"It's like a roller-coaster. You're terrified, but it's fun!\" Watching this insane theatrical challenge keeps you on the edge of your seat and laughing."
