Coming from a country that is completely isolated from the rest of Europe, he is fascinated by the lifestyle, society and \"erotic exuberance\" of the Czech golden youth, yet feeling strong links with his family in his homeland. He falls in love with a married woman (Anna Geislerová), the wife of a police superintendent (Paolo Buglioni) and is insecure about his future."
