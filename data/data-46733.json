    "overview": "I, Pet Goat II is an animated film brimming with silent messages and esoteric symbolism. While the movie has no dialog, each symbol tells a piece of a story that covers the fields of history, politics, war, occultism and spirituality. This film explores the Fire of Truth at the Heart of Suffering in a lyrical way. SYMBOLIC REMIX OF THE WORLD’S MODERN TRAVESTIES RENDERED WITH AN INCREDIBLE LEVEL OF POLISH BY A NEW CANADIAN ANIMATION STUDIO."
