    "overview": "The Simian Line is an American improvisational film, released in 2001. When Katharine throws a party on Halloween, a psychic called Arnita predicts that one of the three couples present at the party will break up by the end of the year. The guests don't take her seriously. Arnita doesn't tell them that she can see a fourth couple at the party, the long dead Mae and Edward. As days go by, Katharine grows increasingly jealous of her lover Rick, and his flirting with her neighbor Sandra. Sandra is married to Paul (Jamey Sheridan). Marta and Billy are rock musicians who live in the same building as Katharine."
