    "overview": "This examination of a famous scandal from the 1970s explores the relationship between Barbara Baekeland and her only son, Antony. Barbara, a lonely social climber unhappily married to the wealthy but remote plastics heir Brooks Baekeland, dotes on Antony, who is homosexual. As Barbara tries to \"cure\" Antony of his sexuality -- sometimes by seducing him herself -- the groundwork is laid for a murderous tragedy."
