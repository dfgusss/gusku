    "overview": "A little sea resort on the Picardie coast, the last week of august. When handing over the keys to a rented apartment, Sylvain makes the acquaintance of two beautiful women. This is a fabulous occasion for him to escape his routine, single life in which women are a rarity, even if only for a few days. Quickly Sylvain's new friends can't do without him. Unfortunately, things get complicated when feelings and flirty Gilles, the local lady's man, get mixed up in it all."
