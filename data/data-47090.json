    "overview": "When a young boy goes missing inside his own house, Detective Skok of the Missing Persons Unit  immediately recognizes the unusualness of the case and takes the opportunity to have his team move in with the family and become residents of the crime scene. What follows is an investigation that leaves no stone unturned, no family member un-interrogated – and no wall without an entire wallpaper made up of missing posters."
