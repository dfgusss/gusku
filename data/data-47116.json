    "overview": "25-year-old former model Steffi has everything that she considers necessary for a perfect future: a man who can support him financially, a beautiful home, and a pregnancy--albeit via sperm donation. Nobody's perfect, after all. But when she discovers that her husband is cheating on her, she is determined to find out more about the origins of her child. She is led to 26-year-old Tommi Gehrke's garden shed, where she finds her worst nightmare: the prototype of a total loser."
