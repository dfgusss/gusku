    "overview": "Bop Girl Goes Calypso is a 1957 American United Artists film directed by Howard W. Koch and starring Judy Tyler. It featured Calypso music, and music by the Bobby Troup Trio and bassist Jim Aton. The calypso craze of the late 1950s drives this fun musical about grad student Bob Hilton (Bobby Troup), who sets out to prove that rock 'n' roll and bop are going the way of the dinosaur, to be replaced by the refreshing rhythms of calypso."
