When a moment arrives, his choice at that point in time will change everything. His roommate is a female German Shepherd called Lonesome. One night, after supper, Lonesome wants to be taken out. Demetris tries to change her mind, but Lonesome insists. It’s at this moment that he comes to a decision. This decision will change his entire life. If Demetris goes out, he will meet Christina, the love of his life. If he stays in, he will not meet her. Does true love exist? What is the impact of a severe economic crisis on people, and how can the crisis destroy a couple? One story shown from two different angles."
