    "overview": "On a nice summer day a funny little car rolls over a peaceful farm yard of Muhu island. The family that withdraws from the vehicle is quite odd-looking: an overbearing madam, a henpecked stammering husband and a mystical red-head. They announce that they want to spend their vacation in the farm ... \"We are from capital, we will pay\". This quiet vacation turns out to be a frantic day with romance, unexpected turns and fisticuffs between suitors."
