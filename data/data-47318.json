    "overview": "Carapiru is a member of one of Brazil's remaining indigenous peoples, living in harmony with nature and making wise use of the local flora and fauna. But Carapiru is suddenly forced to fend for himself and flees into the nearby rain forest, building a new life for himself with the help some sympathetic settlers. However, after rebuilding his life Carapiru is uprooted once again, this time by government agents. A expressive visual storytelling in this study of the native peoples of Brazil in the 21st century."
