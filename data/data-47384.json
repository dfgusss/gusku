    "overview": "Bernard Fine's career leaves little time for romance, so fate takes over.  When Bernie befriends a little girl, he meets - and falls for - her single mother, Liz.  They soon marry and add a son to their new family.  But the happiness is short-lived as Liz is fatally stricken by cancer.  Added to the heartbreak is a threat from the past that could tear the family apart.  For Bernie, it's a struggle to hold on to and savor the truly fine things in life."
