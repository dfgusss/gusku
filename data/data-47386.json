    "overview": "In this one, we're witness to a sort of vaudeville show with an all-animal cast, including a myopic turtle and a pig very proud of his ability to play the flute. There's a troupe of dancing \"girls\" who sing about \"shaking your powder puff,\" and a dog (or wolf, or fox or something) keeps getting thrown out by the management."
