    "overview": "Popeye sees Olive going into the Bruiser Boys Club, where she works in the hospital ward. Their motto, \"Can you take it?\", is a clear challenge to Popeye. President Bluto puts Popeye through the tests, and while he fares better than most, he still ends up in the hospital ward, until he eats his spinach and goes after the members."
