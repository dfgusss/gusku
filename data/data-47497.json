    "overview": "A comedy that walks on the field of non-fiction, focusing on the attempts of an artist (Dídac Alcaraz) to reflect the presence of foreign students in Barcelona. The film reflects the process of a creator who wants to fulfill his dream, complete your project, but to get away ever more of reality. The problem is he has no money, no one understands the film. Only a friend seems willing to help and accompany him on the inner journey that plunges Dídac as you progress in the process of completing his film."
