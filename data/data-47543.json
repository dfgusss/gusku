    "overview": "Richard de la Croix's brother, Andreas, has been driven insane by a notorious vamp and socialite named Sappho. A friend takes Richard to the Odeon to meet her, but when Sappho actually meets him, he is unaware that she is the woman who drove Andreas to be institutionalised. Sappho genuinely falls in love with Richard, and decides to leave her vampy ways and her older lover behind her so that she can have him."
