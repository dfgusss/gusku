    "overview": "Torn between family and work, Eva is a woman enslaved by her sense of duty, always in a rush and invariably stressed. Four days shy of her fateful 50th birthday, Eva works as a clerk in the cosmetics department of a department store to support Francesca, her \"rocker\" daughter, and Lidia, her sprightly mother, after separating from Gino, her ex-husband who has never grown up and continues to complicate her life. The sudden dismissal of a colleague by department head Pagliai fuels Eva's fear that the same fate may befall her, and in an attempt to appear flawless, she will make several mistakes that will further complicate her life. A sort of guardian angel, a strange character who follows her around at all times, will guide her toward solving her problems."
