    "overview": "The Wareckis, an average married couple, stop at a store returning home on New Year’s Eve. The husband goes shopping, the wife stays in the car and waits for him, hours go by but he does not return, in fact, nobody can find him anywhere...  A series of seemingly minor events transforms these simple characters’ lives into a gripping horror-thriller, a wild and disturbing image of the impact of consumerism."
