    "overview": "Donald Duck and Jose Carioca, both literally blue, stumble across the Cafe do Samba, whose proprietor is determined to cheer them up with samba music. After they get their color back, they land in a giant brandy snifter, where a live-action woman is playing the tune on an organ. She also drums and dances a bit. The only dialogue is the lyrics of the song, sung by women."
