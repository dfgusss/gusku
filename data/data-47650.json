    "overview": "A medical researcher working with a blind, mute quadriplegic patient begins to experiment with hypnotherapy as a means to fix his seemingly non-physical ailments. Unfortunately, results are almost impossible to measure on the crippled subject, so she begins monitoring other, healthy test subjects... and even tries hypnosis on herself! What she's unlocking in the human brain may change medical science forever, but will she be remain sane enough - or even alive! - to present her findings?"
