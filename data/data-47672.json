    "overview": "New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton was bilingual, glib, annoying, full of energy and always in front to the media. Growing up in a political family, Layton was a Toronto city councilor for 17 years and was head of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities for a year. He became leader of the federal NDP in 2003 and the party became the Official Opposition for the first time in history. Then his health problems began."
