    "overview": "A pulsating, thrill ride that weaves six scintillating experiences of men in various forms of male bonding, Sexual Tension: Volatile  will leave you wanting more!  A young man feels the adrenaline rush of his sexy tattooist’s needle in ‘Ari’ while in ‘The Cousin,’ a cute boy has a taboo attraction for a family member. Two ‘straight’ buddies literally show, each other, how to make love to a woman in ‘The Other One,’ while a man with ‘Broken Arms’ receives a sensual sponge bath from a male nurse. ‘Love’ is questionable when a broken shower brings a married man and an innkeeper together and in ‘Workout’ two muscular men begin to explore each other chiseled bodies. Voyeuristic pleasures await you as the camera penetrates and caresses the men’s bodies while exploring the mysterious and electrifying nature of male intimacy."
