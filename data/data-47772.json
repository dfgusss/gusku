    "overview": "Three vignettes of old Irish country life, based on a series of short stories. In \"The Majesty of the Law,\" a police officer must arrest an old-fashioned, traditional fellow for assault. The man's principles have the policeman and the whole village, including the man he slugged, sympathizing with him. \"One Minute's Wait\" is about a little train station and glimpses into the lives of the passengers, with a series of comic setups. The third piece, \"1921,\" is about a condemned Irish nationalist and his daring escape."
