    "overview": "A tangled network woven with tiny particles of movements broken out of found footage and compiled anew: the elements of the \"to the left, to the right, back and forth\" grammar of narrative space, discharged from all semantic burden. What remains is a self-sufficient swarm of splinters, fleeting vectors of lost direction, furrowed with the traces of the manual process of production."
