    "overview": "When she was six, Suzanne Hollander saw her mother kill her father. Twenty-five years later, she's a professor of psychology and lives in fear of becoming a criminal like her mother. As she teaches a course at the university, gunfire breaks out on campus, causing several casualties. The shooter is one of her former students with whom she had many conversations about his thesis, on the assessment of empathy. The young man, named Connor, is a dangerous psychopath who keeps the track to declare his love."
