    "overview": "According to Harun Farocki, today's photographers working in advertising are, in a way, continuing the tradition of 17th century Flemish painters in that they depict objects from everyday life - the \"still life\". The filmmaker illustrates this intriguing hypothesis with three documentary sequences which show the photographers at work creating a contemporary \"still life\": a cheese-board, beer glasses and an expensive watch."
