    "overview": "They're known as the Bleacher Bums, a loud and proud group of fans who watch their team's games from the stadium's cheap seats. Most of them have been attending for years, tirelessly rooting for a team that never seems to win. They know each other, but that's no guarantee that they'll get along. As the game unfolds, the Bums argue, wager, cheer and boo... and discover they share more in common than they could ever have imagined."
