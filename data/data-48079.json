    "overview": "This mockumentary about fictional movie studio Adequate Pictures boasts an interesting cast. Tony Randall hosts, and James CoCo (practically on his deathbed) stars as head of the studio. Includes parodies of  everything from silent comedies to porn, including an ultra violent  \"three stooges\" style comedy team who put a new spin on the eye poking  gag."
