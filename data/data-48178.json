    "overview": "Take a walk on the seamy side of town, where you can’t tell the difference between the bad cops and the crooks. Bob Holt, a corrupt detective knee-deep in kickbacks, has an uneasy partnership with a drug-addicted cop and an even shakier alliance with a notorious mob syndicate. When Holt pours the youngest mob brother into a cement freeway structure, it sets in motion a twisted tale of revenge."
