    "overview": "It's the legendary toker jokers Cheech & Chong as you've never seen them before - in their very first animated movie. Catch all the buzz as their most outrageously funny routines and laugh-out-loud lines from their Grammy Award-winning albums come to life, including \"Dave's Not Here,\" \"Let's Make A Dope Deal\" and more. With help from a trippy, bud-lovin' body crab named Buster, Cheech & Chong \"the masters of smokin' word\" deliver the ultimate comedy high and give you the munchies for more."
