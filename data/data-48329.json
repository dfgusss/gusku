    "overview": "The showboat comes to town, piloted by Captain Benny. A quartet sings \"Go Into Your Dance\" in honor of its originator, Al Jolson. They introduce the conductor, who is a pig caricature of orchestra leader Paul Whiteman. One of the musicians plugs the pig's tail into a light socket so he conducts at super speed. Then Captain Benny announces the start of the amateur hour, with an operatic cow and a tough guy reciting poetry with sound effects."
