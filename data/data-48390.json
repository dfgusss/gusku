On the way he meets Rose Fargo and rescues her from the unwanted advances of a gambler, \"Blackjack\". When Chad and Rose arrive they find that Jubal and his partner, Shawnee, are really rustlers and outlaws. Jubal tries to get Chad to join them but he refuses, and leaves to set up his own homestead with Rose at his side. Later, the repentant Jubal comes to join him. Shawnee, angry at what he considers a double-cross, attacks the brothers with his gang."
