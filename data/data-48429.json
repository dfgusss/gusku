    "overview": "Long before O'Reilly and Beck, Morton Downey, Jr., was tearing up the talk-show format with his divisive populism. Between the fistfights, rabid audience, and Mort's cigarette smoke always \"in your face,\" The Morton Downey Jr. Show was billed as \"3-D television,\" \"rock and roll without the music.\" Évocateur meditates on the hysteria that ended the '80s and ultimately its most notorious agitator."
