    "overview": "Two dippy roommates, struggling musicians Lolly and Hattie, are asked by a drug-dealing friend-of-a-friend, Diane, to baby-sit a bag containing nearly a million dollars while she scoots out of town in order to avoid trouble. Once the money is in their possession, however, temptation proves too much for them."
