    "overview": "Paloma is a young psychiatrist, who is hired to work as a director of a clinic in Galicia, and is attracted to Mario, her very first patient. He suffers from a rare form of amnesia, commonly known as Korsakov's syndrome. As a result, both his short and long term memories are affected, and he has temporary lapses of perception. However, Paloma finds Mario to be a fascinating individual, not just a regular patient. Intrigued, she decides to explore Mario's past and, through their dialogues, their relationship takes an unexpected turn."
