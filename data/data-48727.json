Enlisting the help of London gangster Brendan and his associates, Tony hatches a plan to steal a priceless Goya painting. Things get complicated when the heist leaves Tony concussed and Brendan with no painting. When Brendan takes Tony to a Harley Street hypnotherapist to try to cure his amnesia and remember what he did with the painting, the hypnotherapist realises she's onto something, and uses her considerable skill to manipulate minds and memories to her own advantage.."
