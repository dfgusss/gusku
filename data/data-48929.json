    "overview": "For many years, Sasha Lvova has been waiting for the return of her lover, pilot Aleksei Astakhov, refusing to believe in his death at the front. And he really returns to her and his son after captivity, but this is a completely different person, rejected by society, expelled from the profession. It is difficult to say how Aleksei’s fate would have been if it hadn’t for Sasha’s love, her ability to survive in the most difficult circumstances."
