Mariska and Liliomfi fall in love without suspecting that Mariska's foster father, Professor Szilvay, is also Liliomfi's uncle. Soon the couple must contend with the professor's plan to make Liliomfi give up his \"unrespectable\" profession of acting by exposing the professor's hypocrisy, greed, and tyrannical selfishness."
