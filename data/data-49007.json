    "overview": "In this hip-hop slanted horror opus, a group of struggling rap musicians think they've gotten their big break when they're tapped to record with star-making producer Dr. Bones. But the rappers soon learn that Dr. Bones has more than music on his mind; he's using their music to turn listeners into zombies -- and then force his willing slaves to join him in a bid to take over the world!"
