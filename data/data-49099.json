    "overview": "Stunning cinematography and lilting music highlight this exploration of our compulsion to connect with the ocean. Surfers, scientists and those who make their living from the sea discuss why the ocean is vital to our survival and well-being. Pollution, overpopulation and other environmental concerns are examined, as is the spiritual renewal that results from living in touch with the beauty and strength of the ocean."
