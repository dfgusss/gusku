    "overview": "Paramount's first all-talking picture, Interference was dismally directed by Roy Pomeroy, whose lofty status as the studio's \"technical wizard\" did not necessarily qualify him to be a director. Evelyn Brent heads the cast as scheming Deborah Kane, who sets out to blackmail Faith Marley (Doris Kenyon), the above-reproach wife of Sir John Marlay."
