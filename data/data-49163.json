But finding a job, a wife and a sense of purpose doesn't come easy when you're living in a halfway house surrounded by junkies and thugs. Things start to look up when Virgil falls for Ruby (Kirsten Russell), a prostitute and fellow lost soul, but her drug addiction stands in the way of his shot at a normal life."
