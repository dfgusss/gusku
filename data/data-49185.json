    "overview": "While doing their work on the deep underwater station two aquanauts discover strange mystery: it seems as if one of the aquanaut's girlfriend who recently died in a car crash had turned into a big manta fish. That manta writes words on the station's port-holes and tries to draw attention many other ways."
