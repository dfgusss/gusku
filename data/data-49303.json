    "overview": "In his first hour-long special on Comedy Central, comedian and podcast host (You Made It Weird) Pete Holmes perfects his signature silliness and really gets into that time Juan won one. While he may look like a youth pastor, he's as comfortable talking about religion as he is secretly hating his girlfriend's friends and being a straight man who is 100% Gay for Ryan Gosling. Trust us, this special is McDonald's."
