    "overview": "The early years of a television sports powerhouse are chronicled as ABC becomes a player in the NFL coverage by putting their full resources into a major showcase. Executive Roone Arledge recruits former Dallas Cowboys quarterback 'Dandy' Don Meredith, Keith Jackson, and the combative Howard Cosell as commentators for the broadcasts, which become funny, odd trio events to millions of viewers. Jackson departs the show after the first year to take over the network's focus on college football, and former New York Giants star Frank Gifford takes his place, ruffling Cosell's feathers. Then things get really crazy!"
