    "overview": "Compilation of two shorts also distributed independently: Cricket und Reifenspiel [Croquet and the Arc and Hook Game], and Springschnur und Amazonen [Jump Roping and the Amazons]. In a sunny day, on a lawn in the woods, three nude, young brunettes with little flower arrangements on their hair are playing a succession of three dexterity games: throwing and catching three arcs with the use of a thin long hook, jumping the rope (soon replaced by a long piece of light cloth), and using the arcs as hoops for a bit of croquet with appropriate mallets and balls."
