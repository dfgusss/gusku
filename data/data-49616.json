A rural family clings to life until the resourceful Sulo uses the salvific powers of sauna, moonshine, and tar to resurrect his injured brother Arvo, their deceased mother, and even buried revolutionaries. When Arvo drifts to Helsinki and falls into illicit moonshining and wild pursuits of a celebrity, Sulo and their revived mother set out to retrieve him from his urban excesses."
