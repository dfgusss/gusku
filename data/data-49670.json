    "overview": "Taming Tammy, as the name may suggest, is an adaptation of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew. However, it's not only a modernization, but also has a twist; the role of Bianca, the younger sister, is now a gay younger brother, Tristan (Ryan Kennedy). Tammy (Sarah-Jane Redmond), the \"shrew\" is a very feminist sex toy salesperson who seems to scare every man who crosses her path."
