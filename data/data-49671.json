    "overview": "The dream began 20 years ago, when a young pinsetter watched a star bowler win a championship. Now, Harold (Dreamer) Nuttingham has a chance to attain his dream — to win the Tournament of Champions and buy his own lanes. But what price will he pay? The woman he loves sees only that his dream re-locates her to second place in his life; Harry White, his friend and mentor pushes him to become the champion Harry wanted to be — and never was. Torn between ambition and love, Dreamer fights to have both."
