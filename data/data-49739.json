    "overview": "Based on 'Il fu Mattia Pascal', one of Pirandello's many stories concerning the transitory nature of the intangibles \"truth\" and \"identity\". Mattia Pascal is a downtrodden average man, treated like trash by his fiancée, scorned by his associates, and cheated out of his inheritance by contemptuous relatives. The dispirited Pascal heads to Monte Carlo, accruing a fortune and also assuming the identity of a less fortunate gambler who killed himself. The \"new\" Pascal is treated with a dignity and respect that overwhelms him--and nearly kills him."
