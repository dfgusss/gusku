    "overview": "An old Russian grandmother or \"babushka\", who took part in the Battle of Stalingrad, sacrificed everything for her children and even sold her house to get money for her grandchildren, is shuttled among those very grandchildren--products of the \"new\" Russia--none of whom want her to stay with them since she's too much of a \"burden\" for them."
