    "overview": "23-year-old Elviz from Hamburg-Altona is in a tight spot: his uncle wants the 50,000 euros he once lent Elviz back  — he promises to seize Elviz's mother's property on the Turkish Riviera otherwise. But Elviz knows how to make money quickly these days and founds the first Turkish-language telephone sex hotline, \"Süperseks\". It's going great - and only gets Elviz into more trouble when his new girlfriend Anna applies for a job with \"Süperseks\", unaware of who is behind the company."
