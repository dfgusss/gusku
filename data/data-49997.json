    "overview": "It is an ordinary day at the bank. A somewhat stressed young man makes an entrance and sits down among the other waiting customers. When it is his turn at the lady cashiers he suddenly draws a pistol and declares it is a bank robbery. It is a situation that could have terrifying consequences if it was not for the the cashiers unusual take on the situation."
