    "overview": "In the darkroom, 50 unexposed film strips were laid across a surface, upon which a frame of \"La sortie des ouvrier de l'usine Lumière\" was projected. The stringing together of the individual developed sections make up the new film, which reads the original frame like a page from a musical score: within the strips from top to bottom and sequentially from left to right."
