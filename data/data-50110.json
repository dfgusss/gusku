    "overview": "A sing-along short with Irving Kaufman singing, Lew White at the organ, lyrics displayed for the viewing audience, and film clips illustrating the songs. \"I Love a Parade\" includes a montage of military marchers; \"Baby Parade\" is music and montage without Kaufman's singing although lyrics are superimposed on the screen images of children passing by. Then, it's on to \"Presidents on Parade,\" featuring Washington, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Wilson, Coolidge, and FDR. Kaufman adds narration to bridge each piece."
