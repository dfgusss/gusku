    "overview": "After nearly 50 years of eye-poking and face-slapping, the Stooges decide to retire and tour the world with their dog, Moose. They start by touring America's national parks, however, with the stooges, it is truly a \"kook's tour\". This especially proves to be the case, for Larry, who despite his best efforts, simply cannot seem to catch a fish. Larry is driven to the height of frustration as he is continually outfished by Moe, Joe, Moose, and even his own hat!"
