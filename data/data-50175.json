    "overview": "New inmate Clay Treyton, doing time for fisticuffs, is sent to a Montana ranch where prisoners spend time working with horses. Encouraged by the warden, the men ride in prison rodeos, and murderer Ry Weston, an ex-pro horseman, is the team's top performer. Clay and Ry become friends, exchanging lessons about horses and life. But when prison black marketeers start leaning on Ry, the men have more than rodeos to worry about."
