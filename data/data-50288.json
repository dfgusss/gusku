    "overview": "Banksy’s work now reportedly changes hands for millions.  But he puts up his street art for free. Have you ever wondered  what would happen if you got your hands on one of these?  Does it mean you’ve found a winning lottery ticket or just  scraped some worthless crap off a wall?  Going up against the Art Establishment, Critics, Auction Houses,  Gallery Owners and Authentication Boards in a quest for the  elusive meal ticket, two filmmakers unwittingly gatecrash the  murky and protective world of Banksy.  “HOW TO SELL A BANKSY” raises questions of ownership,  authentication and the true value of art itself. Through all the  chaos and incompetence comes a modern-day, true-story,  crime-theft, comedy-caper."
