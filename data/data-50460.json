    "overview": "The Lord sees that the stock value of \"Pair-o-dice\" is dropping on the exchange so he dispatches a slow-witted and slow-talking angel to sinful Harlem to recruit new customers. When this fails, God finds success sending a group of musical angels with a little more swing in their style, so much so that even the Devil wants to join up!  One of the “Censored 11” banned from TV syndication by United Artists in 1968 for racist stereotyping."
