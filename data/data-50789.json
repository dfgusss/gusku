Miranda, a beautiful yet seemingly forlorn guest, whiles away the hours waiting for her perpetually late lover. As conversations between them blossom into a connection neither anticipated, a forbidden spark ignites. Will they succumb to the fiery temptation of a fleeting passion, or will they cage their desires for a life dictated by circumstance?"
