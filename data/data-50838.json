    "overview": "Cossacks cooked borscht, but ran out of salt, and what kind of taste without salt? They go to the fair, where they find out that the Chumaks who traded the salt, were robbed by the Evil Pan (local feudal lord). In this series, the Cossacks, fighting off the Evil Pan and his servants, try to bring the stolen salt to the bazaar in order to transfer it to the hands of the rightful owners - the Chumaks."
