    "overview": "In 1960s Krynica, veteran artist Włosiński’s orderly life is disrupted when local outsider Nikifor - deaf, mute, and dismissed as a harmless eccentric - arrives at his studio and begins painting his naïve masterpieces.  Their unlikely friendship transforms both men, sparking a late-life creative and personal rebirth that reshapes Włosiński’s world and finally earns Nikifor recognition for his singular talent."
