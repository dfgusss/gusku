    "overview": "16-year-old Jonas becomes a father against his will. Jonas always wants to please everyone. But when 17-year-old Vicky, a half-forgotten party flirt, hands him a letter one day, his life is never the same again – he has become a father overnight. With charm and clever ingenuity, Vicky finally convinces Jonas to at least take a look at little Klara. With Vicky's persistence and her commitment to the child's love, Jonas gradually learns to take responsibility for his life."
