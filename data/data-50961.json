    "overview": "A Black Forest village in the 1950s. Liesbeth Steiner refuses to give up hope that her husband Max has survived the war and Russian captivity. She waits for every homecoming train, but to no avail. Liesbeth and her young son Josef found refuge on her parents-in-law's farm. It never became a home, as Max never told his family about his war marriage. His sister Margarete, who keeps the farm running, suspects that Liesbeth is an heiress. When Max is finally included in a late repatriation transport in 1955, Liesbeth hopes that different times are dawning. But Max has changed a lot over the years."
