    "overview": "A film about the backstage life of an ordinary Moscow bar, where relationships between the owner, the racketeer and the employees are pretty reminiscent of the ones in a family. However, unlike a family, they are connected by a mutual cause, the role in which are far from equal. Submission and humiliation weave through the characters' entire lives."
