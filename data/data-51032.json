    "overview": "Chris has it all worked out: he's ready to leave high school behind and head to college in his sweet new ride. The problem is, he'll be leaving behind his best friend and partner in rhyme, Dylan. And he still has to get with Autumn, the girl he's had a crush on since the second grade. The solution? Throw one last party where Chris and Dylan can show off their skills with words and women. But a little get-together becomes a hilariously epic disaster where anything can happen and anyone might turn up... including the original house partiers, Kid 'n Play."
