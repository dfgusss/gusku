As moving day gets closer, Jessica tries to make Jamie jealous by dating other girls. But Jessica's plan backfires, in a way she could never imagine. Set in working class Chicago and infused with musical dance numbers, \"Jamie and Jessie are Not Together\" is a love letter to those gray areas of love and lust and to the young romances we will never forget."
