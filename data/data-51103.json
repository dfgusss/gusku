    "overview": "The city of Brasilia hoped to become, from its very architecture, the expression of modern urban conception and an egalitarian society. However, neither the workers hired to pursue this project, nor the constant migratory flow that took place from the beginning, fitted in the government’s plan. In 1971, it began what was known as the “Campaign to Eradicate Invaders”. Together with other locals, the director reflects on the history, the transformations and the future of this place where the hypocritical official jingle “A cidade é uma só!” is no longer heard."
