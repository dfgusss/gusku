    "overview": "A young man wants to be a female impersonator, but gets mocked in his very first performance by a fierce older woman. He finds out where she lives and goes to her house expecting an apology. Instead, she locks him in her shed and rapes him. It makes him fall for her. But soon her even darker side reveals itself when she believes he is attracted to her more beautiful visiting cousin."
