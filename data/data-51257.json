    "overview": "Forget martinis and Austin Powers. This documentary is an unflinching portrait of the realities of \"swinging,\" and it's not exactly a shaggadelic picture; in fact, the swingers we meet in the film are older, often lonely people. Most of them are simply looking to break out of their conventional, well-ordered lives by adopting \"the lifestyle.\" Birds and bees may not do it, but we learn that monkeys do -- as well as 3 million Americans."
