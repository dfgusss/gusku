    "overview": "Ensemble for Somnambulists was a film Maya Deren made while teaching a workshop at the Toronto Film Society. It was never completed, and is officially \"unpublished,\" but this title has been restored and it screens occasionally along with her other films. It is sort of a preliminary sketch for The Very Eye of Night.  ~ David Lewis, Rovi"
