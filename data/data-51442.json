    "overview": "In 1972, Djibril Diop Mambety shoots \"Touki Bouki.\" Mory and Anta are in love. Two young lovers share the same dream: to leave Dakar for Paris. At the fateful moment, Anta embarks. Mory stays alone on quay, unable to tear himself away from his land. Forty years later, \"A Thousand Suns\" investigates the personal and universal inheritance which represents \"Touki Bouki.\" What has happened since? Magaye Niang, the hero of the movie, has never left Dakar. And today, the old cowboy wonders where Anta is, the love of his youth. Stories about family, exile and cinema meet between the sphere of intimacy and that of myth."
