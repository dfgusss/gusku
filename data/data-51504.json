    "overview": "Ever since I started making films it has bothered me in a certain sense that film images are far too concrete, because technically they try to imitate the sense of space characteristic of everyday life. So the story ignites the imagination only to be slowed down by the images and stops the viewer from taking a flight of fantasy. I have always been searching for an intrinsically different tool in filmmaking. One that could record space in its temporal progression. I would never have thought it existed!"
