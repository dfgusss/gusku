Simon, her fiancé, intends to find out... Several months after the disappearance, Simon learns of Pauline's death abroad. While cleaning out her apartment, Simon discovers that Lazare, Pauline's cat, still occupies his master's apartment. He possesses an extraordinary long-term memory... and a need for revenge!"
