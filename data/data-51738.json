    "overview": "Young Hiroko’s (Takako Irie) conservative principles place her at odds with most modern women, as she has already submitted to her mother’s choice of man for any marriage prospect. Married into an affluent family that practically treats her as a housemaid, locked away like a “doll” by her estimation, Hiroko’s own submission to traditional thinking brings contradictions to light."
