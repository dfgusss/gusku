    "overview": "Tom Selznick, the most talented pianist of his generation, stopped performing in public because of his stage fright. Years after a catastrophic performance, he reappears in public in a long awaited concert in Chicago. Just moments after starting his performance in the packed theater, in front of an expectant audience, Tom finds a threatening message written on the score: 'Play one wrong note and you die'. Without leaving the piano, Tom must discover the anonymous sniper's motives and look for help without anyone realizing."
