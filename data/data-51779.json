    "overview": "The world has changed beyond recognition. Just yesterday the bustling streets are now deserted and quiet. All around are left in a hurry vehicles, convoys of military equipment, few people move in fear without end. The sky is becoming more green. In search of answers Andrey Luptsov begins a journey with his neighbor Ivan. But where to go when the world is increasingly alien and incomprehensible? Along the way, he finds an unconscious ballerina Andriy Bella, taking care of her, coming to her forgetting about what is going on around them."
