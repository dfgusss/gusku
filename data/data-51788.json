    "overview": "In the fall of 1938, the NKVD arrested Sergei Korolyov. Under torture, the investigators are trying to extract from him a confession of anti-Soviet activities, each time citing incriminating facts from the biography of the young scientist. Plunging into Korolev's memories, the viewer sees what an extraordinary and enthusiastic person he was, how much creative energy and vitality Sergei Pavlovich gave to the development of world cosmonautics."
