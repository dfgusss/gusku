    "overview": "There's never a dull moment from the time Clint Northern meets Dan John Fighting Bear at his granddaughter's birthday party. The two take an instant dislike to each other but find themselves unlikely partners when they're mistaken as the culprits of a local bingo heist! Madness and mayhem ensue as they embark on a mission to clear their names and bring the real culprits to justice while evading a vengeful cop, and a crazed casino security guard. It's a barrel of laughs that never stops rolling! Along the way, they get a lot more adventure than they bargained for, some newfound respect, and quite possibly a lasting friendship."
