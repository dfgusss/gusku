    "overview": "Indy and his girlfriend, Nancy Stratemeyer, whose father created the Nancy Drew mystery series, visit the laboratory of inventor Thomas Edison. The two must contend with dangerous German spies as they struggle to keep Edison's top secret new invention out of the hands of hostile enemy agents. To keep him from getting into any more trouble, Indy is sent to visit his aunt in New Mexico. While there, he is kidnapped by Pancho Villa and swept into the Mexican Revolution. Chaotic, free-wheeling border towns, a \"Wild Bunch\" style train robbery and a colorful barroom encounter with a young George Patton make for thrilling entertainment in this action-packed movie."
