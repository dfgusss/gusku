    "overview": "Ireland's bloody 1916 Easter Uprising, the suffragette movement in England, a Zeppelin raid, and a meeting with a rising young British cabinet member named Winston Churchill become vivid vignettes in Indy's life. So too do his brief but impassioned romances with the sister of a clandestine Irish rebel, and with an English suffragette for whom the vote comes before love."
