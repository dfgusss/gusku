    "overview": "Receiving orders to assist the British in an attack on the ancient Middle Eastern desert town of Beersheba, Indy goes undercover with a beautiful lady spy. Relying on his wits and her tantalizing skill at belly dancing, the daring duo works desperately to defuse the explosives placed in the city's vital water wells by the occupying Turks. The story culminates in a spectacular cavalry charge by the gallant soldiers of the Australian Lighthorsemen Regiment, whose very survival hinges on the success of Indy's mission."
