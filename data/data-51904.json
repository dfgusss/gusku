    "overview": "While working for a Hollywood movie studio, Indy finds that he is no match for the wily megalomaniacal director Erich von Stroheim when the two lock horns over the ever increasing budget of Stroheim's film Foolish Wives. Though battered by the film industry, Indy decides to give it one more chance and goes on a location shoot with legendary director John Ford. Ford and his cronies, including aging gunman Wyatt Earp, help him see the magic of movies and moviemaking, and when an actor is accidentally killed, Indy pitches in to save the film."
