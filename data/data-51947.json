    "overview": "Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy maybe wins her back... This musical comedy follows Natalie as she sorts out her thoughts on love, sex and communication with her boyfriend Matt, her best friend Christian (Nico Izambard), and ultimately herself. Inspired by the sensibilities of Ernst Lubitsch's landmark musicals of the '30s, where the songs never upstage the film, but are instead an integrated part of the character's lives. \"yellow\" features seven-and-a-half original songs written by Schopmeyer, which were recorded live on set with an ensemble of local area musicians."
