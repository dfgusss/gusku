    "overview": "Radio singer Glory Eden is publicized as the ideal of American womanhood in order to sell the sponsor's product Ippsie-Wippsie Washcloths. In reality, Glory would like to at least sample booze, jazz, gambling, and men. When the strain of representing \"purity\" brings her to rebellion, the sponsor and his nutty henchmen pick her a public-relations \"sweetheart\" from fan mail, who turns out to be a hayseed."
