    "overview": "The new academic year for student corps H.S.C. Mercurius with a huge enrollment party. Perpetual student Olivier de Ruyter gets into a minor conflict with the police, who are fed up with the nuisance Mercurius is causing in the neighborhood. Meanwhile, lawyer Bram Wagtmans is nostalgic for student life and decides to go all out with his friends at the club that evening, for the last time. First-year students and best friends Elias and Lieve also attend the party. Lieve is the ideal sorority girl, while Elias is only at the party because he is in love with Lieve. These are the ingredients for an evening that will get completely out of hand."
