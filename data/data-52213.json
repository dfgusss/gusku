    "overview": "For having wanted to defend a young girl accused of theft, a comedian finds himself in prison. Embarked in spite of himself in an escape attempt, he is condemned by a particularly incompetent court which follows without thinking the pleadings of an overzealous public prosecutor! Once incarcerated, the poor comedian has to deal with the harassment of one of the guards, a kind of dangerous sociopath frustrated with life."
