    "overview": "Los Angeles, 2006. Life is Easy 2.0 for James Pongo. He has a cushy job, a busy social life and an alluring love interest all through the click of a mouse. But when he wakes up after a night of reckless partying to discover that his computer is missing, James' hyper-connected reality takes a nosedive. Told entirely through the websites, programs, games and social networks, 0s & 1s uses James Pongo's nihilistic adventure to question our growing dependency on these alternate digital realities."
