    "overview": "Le Bourgeois gentilhomme satirizes attempts at social climbing and the bourgeois personality, poking fun both at the vulgar, pretentious middle-class and the vain, snobbish aristocracy. The title is meant as an oxymoron: in Molière's France, a \"gentleman\" was by definition nobly born, and thus there could be no such thing as a bourgeois gentleman."
