    "overview": "As host of gladiator-style duels in which gangbangers battle to the death, East Los Angeles drug kingpin Chesare (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) capitalizes on gang antagonisms. But Chesare hasn't counted on the tactics of vengeance-minded Aurelio (Tony Bravo) and his sidekick Paulo (Kamar De Los Reyes). Vowing to fight without weapons, the determined duo stages a risky coup in the hopes of ending Chesare's reign of terror."
