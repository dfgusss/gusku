The Sharma family consists of Mr. Sharma, his wife Shalini Sharma, only daughter Manisha Sharma or \"Mini\" as they affectionately call her; and their grandchild Bunty, as his parents had been killed in an accident. Strange things start happening, with a return of a dead kitten, and the brutal murder of Manisha's friend, Reshmi; an attempt to kill Mr. Sharma and Manisha's boyfriend, Deepak. What is the force behind these brutalities? Is it natural or supernatural?"
