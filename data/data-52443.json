    "overview": "While her parents are absent, Isabell has invited a few of her closest, best-behaving friends to celebrate New Year's Eve in her house. However, the good spirit turns sour when some older guys crash the party. The alcohol they bring put the teens in a frenzied state where friends become enemies, couples cheat on each other and medical student Peter is almost killed in a party they won't easily forget."
