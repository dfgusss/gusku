An unexpected opportunity falls on Tae-sik's lap one day when Won-joon is involved in a hit-and-run accident and Tae-sik takes the blame as the driver instead of Won-joon. In exchange, Won-joon promises Tae-sik his debut as an actor. Tae-sik's acting career kicks off when he gets out of jail, and his success and stardom start to threaten and intimidate Won-joon. Tae-sik finally becomes much more popular than Won-joon, but his pure passion turns into greed and he’s on the road to corruption."
