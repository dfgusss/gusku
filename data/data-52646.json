    "overview": "Twelve-year-old Marie has a very special relationship with the house where she lives with her extended family. Marie secretly talks to it as if it were alive and interprets strange occurrences in the somewhat dilapidated building as 'human' reactions and behaviors of the villa. When Marie's grandmother, who has been dreaming for years of making humanity happy with her environmentally friendly technical inventions, falls for a con artist, loses all her money, and the property is about to be auctioned off, the desperate girl tries everything to save her home. In doing so, she is not only 'actively' supported by the house, but also by her friends Stefan and Konrad. However, this is complicated by the fact that both of them want to \"go out\" with her and suddenly demand that she choose one of them."
