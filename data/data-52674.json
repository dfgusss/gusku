But that’s about to change… As their high school graduation nears, Pete plans to marry Maggie, the love of his life, and head off to school to become a preacher. Andy, who wants  nothing to do with God, has no plans, no direction, and seemingly no future. But in a cruel twist of fate—orchestrated by a rival for  Maggie’s heart—their lives are forever altered. Can the brothers gain vengeance on those who have taken away from them all that matters?"
