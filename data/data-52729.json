    "overview": "An artist is painting the portrait of a young woman dressed in a country costume in his attic studio. The landlord demands the rent, but the artist has no money. The model tries to comfort him, but he throws her out. Dancing safes appear and he takes bags of gold coins out of them. A woman fairy appears and she transports them to a palace. Soldiers march in and a troupe of women dancers perform. The artist's model attempts to pawn her jewelry to help pay the rent. A rain of what appears to be fire begins to fall and the artist awakens in his studio, bent on suicide."
