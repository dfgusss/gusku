In present-day Finland, an international corporation led by chairman Kurt Dudler is about to launch a virtual service that directly affects the human mind, which the new CEO Sampo Väinölä opposes. When Sampo's father, Väinö, makes his son aware of the ancient powers, he realises he is involved in an ancient battle between Kalevala and Pohjola."
