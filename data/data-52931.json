    "overview": "We take a tour of Porky's Poppa's farm, to the tune of Old MacDonald. After meeting several animals, \"on this farm, he has a mortgage\" which he frets over, particularly since Bessie has stopped producing milk. Poppa orders an Acme milk producing robot, and the beast vs. machine battle is on."
