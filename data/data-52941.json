    "overview": "In a small Chinese village in Yunnan, a young woman named Xiwen sees her little son Shitou die of poisoning from adulterated food. On the other side of the world, in Italy, Matteo works on behalf of Feng, a multinational based in Hong Kong that traffics counterfeit food. To avoid arrest, Matteo escapes from Italy, saving a precious shipment of Feng's food, and this begins his unscrupulous climb towards success. At a time when he is enjoying the greatest prestige within Feng, Matteo meets Xiwen by chance, who has opened a restaurant in memory of his son and is fighting for the authenticity of food. Neither of them imagines that from that moment their lives will be turned upside down."
