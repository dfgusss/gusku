    "overview": "A bumbling martial arts teacher has the skills but lacks the confidence to use them.  Run out of town by some ne'er-do-wells, he sets out on some comic adventures as he travels the countryside.  Taking up some companions that are as bumbling as he is, the group seems to stumble into one misadventure after another.  Will our hearty band eventually prove their worth with their skills and bring their enemies to justice?"
