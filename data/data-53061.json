Miffed, the woman decides to go ahead with the wedding anyway to teach her fiancé a lesson, so she calls her lawyer, Henry, and has him stand in for her missing groom. She intends to divorce her new \"husband\" at the first opportunity, but Henry--who has been in love with her for a long time--is determined to win his \"wife's\" hand."
