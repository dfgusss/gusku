    "overview": "Tongue-in-cheek look at the French Riviera, especially in summer when it overflows with tourists. Reviews its history and famous visitors; displays its faux-exotic buildings, its crowded beaches, its trees and monuments; and, pokes fun at the colors women wear and the vagaries of fashion. The film celebrates the use of \"Eden\" as a place name, suggesting that paradise comes to the coast after all are gone, perhaps only on a remote island beach."
