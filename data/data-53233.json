    "overview": "In the not-so distant future, researchers at a deep-sea laboratory have finally invented a time machine. Head researcher Woo-seok is promised funding from a mega-corporation if he completes a test flight. He and Young-eun carry out the mission and travel to 11 A.M. the next day, only to find the base on the verge of collapse. All the researchers are gone and someone is out to kill them."
