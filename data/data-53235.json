    "overview": "A musical, semi-documentary motion picture considering the making of \"Shablul\", a rock album by Arik Einstein and Shalom Hanoch. The film demonstrates fragments of being, a few funny sketches and musical numbers, much affected by The Beatles' flicks. \"Shablul\" reminds its viewers the taste of 60s, showing them the Israeli pop/rock scene of these jolly years."
