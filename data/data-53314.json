    "overview": "Seven Ages of Starlight takes us on a journey through the life of stars  Stars are at the heart of all life. Humans and all other life forms on our planet - from bacteria in the top of our atmosphere to the creatures in the darkest depths of our oceans - depend on our very own star, the sun. Much of the matter that makes up the known universe comes from stars and is put into motion by their enormous gravity. Even our planet and our bodies are made from stardust forged in the thermonuclear furnace of brightly burning stars."
