    "overview": "On the eve of Christmas, successful expatriate Karel returns to his quiet mountain village, and suddenly every marriageable girl in town vies for his hand, even storming his cottage. Determined to avoid marriage and instead sell the family farm and leave with his younger brother, he sets his would-be brides impossible tasks, and the very first challenge whittles the contenders down to just one: his stepsister Květa."
