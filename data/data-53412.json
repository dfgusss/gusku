    "overview": "\"Nevada\" and \"Weary\" Pierce hijack the loot taken in a bank hold-up by Les Setter, and his gang. They escape from Sheriff Jim Henry Warner. U. S. government horse-buyer David Ward is killed by Settler's men and Settler takes his papers and goes to the ranch of Blaine and asks for the horses Ward was to buy, promising payment from the government later. He also takes an interest in Ina Blaine, much to the resentment of her sweetheart Ben Ide. \"Nevada\" and \"Weary\" are hired for the horse round-up but Setter has them and Ben arrested on a fake charge."
