Their lives quickly turn into a search for peace and understanding when a single horrific event impacts everything that they have ever loved. While Devin looks to his faith for strength, guidance, and refuge; Matthew shuns his faith placing blame and demanding answers.

An unlikely friendship would soon form, causing both men to meet at a crossroads faced with the same question...Would you love God for nothing?"
