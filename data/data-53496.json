    "overview": "Adapted from a story by Truman Capote (\"In Cold Blood\"), the world of the prison convict is open to the viewer. As the story develops, one thing becomes clear. As in the outside world, there is a \"system\"; and just as on the outside, there is accommodation, honesty, cynicism, violence and all the other factors that make up our society. The film follows the three newcomers, it records the grim, terrifying, sometimes fascinating events that occur."
