The film goes back and forth in time, capturing one Goan monsoon of Full Jhol. Its a card game between the players in the con. Who will come out Aces and who will end up being the Joker?  An amateur gang of young Goans plan the perfect con - no nuksaan, no pareshan. However, all good plans often  It doesn't take long for them to discover that a reverse con has been played back on them - by the very people they were trying to con.  In doing so, the five members of the gang split and start suspecting each other. After all, when there is cash in a briefcase, and a beautiful woman with a gun, things tend to go horribly wrong."
