    "overview": "Paul and Böller from Wanne-Eickel have a dream: they want to apply to be lifeguards on Sylt. Not because the two VoKuHiLa advocates love saving lives so much, but because they are hoping for a lot of beer and a pack of gorgeous women. Once they arrive on the tranquil island, the stylish high society quickly loses its cool thanks to the pair."
