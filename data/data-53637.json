    "overview": "Emrah and Salih are two young university students living in Istanbul. Everything seems normal in their daily lives, but Salih suddenly becomes fascinated with the \"science of magic,\" also known as \"havas.\" Salih's fascination with magic gradually turns into an obsession. He takes things to the next level and wants to control the spirits in the spirit world. Emrah has no idea what is going on, but since they share the same house, his peace of mind is gone, and he finds himself caught up in a cycle he cannot escape. When Salih loses control of everything, Emrah, who begins to see nightmares and no longer has a normal life, finds solace in returning to his family in Izmit. While hoping to find some peace here, those who have been pursuing him do not leave him alone. When his family realizes they cannot help Emrah, they turn to Bakırcı Mehmet Efendi, who has dealt with such matters before."
