    "overview": "What, it would seem, could be more innocent than a women's toilet being renovated? In his booths you can hide from the bustle of the big city, discuss lovers, drink, cry, sleep, smoke and have sex... And you can also hide in it what no one should find.  An unknown beauty leaves a disc with information in the toilet. Two gangsters come to collect theirs and 7 stalls in the closet of a fashionable nightclub become the stage for one of the most unexpected stories of our time."
