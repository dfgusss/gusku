    "overview": "Vicente Ferrer traveled to India in his youth as a member of a Jesuit mission. Years later, he returns to the Asian country in the company of a group of collaborators to develop his humanitarian work. Agustín Crespi directs this biographical film that takes place in India and reviews the last 30 years of the Spanish aid worker and his struggle to help the most disadvantaged . Vicente Ferrer was a figure admired for his humility, his perseverance and his dedication to others, work that was recognized with prestigious awards as the Prince of Asturias de la Concordia. Manuel Arias takes on the challenge of embodying the former curator of Barcelona, a man whose complex idiosyncrasies try to reveal this work. A personality impossible to understand completely without the figure of Anna Ferrer, played by Aída Folch. Folch incarnates the English girl who fell in love with the worker, given in body and soul, from the age of 21, to the cause of her future husband."
