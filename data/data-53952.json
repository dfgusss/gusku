    "overview": "José is a football agent who goes to Ivory Coast to spot young talents in football. He is a braggart , who willingly sleeps with Gigi , a beautiful African woman who loves the luxury he offers her... One day, José spots Yaya, a street boy with the potential of a champion, and brings him to Belgium. Will Yaya be José's reward? Between the poor neighborhoods of Abidjan and Sporting Club of Charleroi, the cultural \"gap\" is brutal... and reserves surprises."
