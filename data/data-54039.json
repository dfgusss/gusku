    "overview": "The service of Pope Paul VI presents tremendous challenges for humanity not only in the political, cultural and economic aspects of the world but also in the spiritual life of The Church. Pope Paul VI is the first Pope to be a Missionary Pope, to meet people where they are. To trust in God as he was asking The Church to do and he is given the opportunity to love that trust in its fullness."
