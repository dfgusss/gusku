    "overview": "Two girls clean places after somebody dies there. Sometimes they sell the belongings of the dead at a flea market. When they meet an odd guy who has a passion for boxes, a strange game unfolds. An unconventional love story about the oddity of ordinary things. Eccentric and natural at once."
