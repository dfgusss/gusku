    "overview": "His advanced studies in philosophy have caused Stephanos to view all people as his inferiors. When he is discharged from the -obligatory in Greece- army service, he thinks the world belongs to him. In reality all that does belong to him are debts left by his mother who has just died and rejection by his formerly devoted girlfriend. Nikos, an old high school classmate, reappears in his life."
