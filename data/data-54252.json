    "overview": "In the near-distant future, a female romance writer is planning to write her next book in a remote mountain cabin. A friend convinces her to bring along a \"companion\", a nearly-human android to cook and clean. She settles on a male companion named \"Geoffrey.\" Bored with some of Geoffrey's behavior, she tinkers with his programming -- first his personality, then his sexuality. Real trouble comes when she gives his mind access to \"random data.\""
