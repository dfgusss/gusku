When she asks to adopt orphan Tommy Bassett, but learns that she will first have to have a husband, Millie turns to a recently fired bus driver, Doug Andrews. Though he has no interest in marriage, Doug offers to help Millie find a husband by transforming her into a beautiful and exciting woman, one who catches the eye of two eligible bachelors, including the orphanage's president."
