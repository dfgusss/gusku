    "overview": "It's COOL! We've got Black Friends! Two rich clueless film school graduates \"the Filmfakers\" are shooting a \"ghetto\" interpretation of an ancient Greek play with the Gangsta Sistas (Olivia Wilde: Alpha Dog, The OC &amp; Megalyn Echiwunwoke:24, That 70's Show) on the mean streets of Los Angeles. Their equipment is \"borrowed\" by three street youths, \"the camjackers\" who use it to shoot a compelling documentary on underground hip-hop. The filmfakers rep off the camjackers' film and rise to fame and fortune, but when the camjackers see their stolen film on TV, they must seek revenge."
