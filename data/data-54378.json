    "overview": "At first glance, it is not obvious that Abbie Evans lives with a life-threatening skin disease.  She is a typical teenager: moody, rebellious, irreverent, and is also strikingly beautiful. But her life is the antithesis of normal.  Abbie grew up in hospitals, cared for by her protective mother. She then came into her own in honky tonks, selling merchandise for her father’s band. But just like any other 18 year-old, Abbie yearns for an identity of her own.  Butterfly Girl charts Abbie’s journey towards a new understanding of how she must balance her past with her future, her parents with her independence, and her disease with her desires.  But what price must she pay for that freedom?"
