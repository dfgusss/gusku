    "overview": "This expansive Greek drama follows a troupe of theater actors as they perform around their country during World War II. While the production that they put on is entitled \"Golfo the Shepherdess,\" the thespians end up echoing scenes from classic Greek tales in their own lives, as Elektra plots revenge on her mother for the death of her father, and seeks help from her brother, Orestes, a young anti-fascist rebel."
