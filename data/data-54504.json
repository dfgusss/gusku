    "overview": "Pixadores are a group of young men from the São Paulo favelas. They paint their message on incredible locations to fight the society that’s suppressing them. An invitation to the Berlin Biennale changes everything for the outcasts. Their art, however, won’t fit the frames provided by the establishment. As the men’s world expands outside the favelas, their friendship is put to test."
