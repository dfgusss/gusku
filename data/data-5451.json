    "overview": "In this humorous paean to the joys of food, a pair of truck drivers happen onto a decrepit roadside shop selling ramen noodles. The widowed owner, Tampopo, begs them to help her turn her establishment into a paragon of the \"art of noodle-soup making\". Interspersed are satirical vignettes about the importance of food to different aspects of human life."
