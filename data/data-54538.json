    "overview": "A shy and reluctant Theology high school teacher in Thessaloniki-Greece decides to solve his erection problem by consulting a doctor for the first time after two years. The doctor just replies that the problem can be solved by R20. R20 is played fabulously by Dimitris Starovas. He is a former psychologist (now operating his father's import export meat business) that uses company trucks as moving brothels. R20 actually stands for: \"Russian 20 years old\" which eventually means that Lakis Lazopoulos has to cheat on his wife to solve his problem."
