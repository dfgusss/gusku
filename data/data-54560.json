    "overview": "The intention of the film is to give an impression of what small exotic Denmark looks like, what the strange Danes look like and how they are. Nearly 100 Danes are presented in the film, amongst them a racing cyclist, a Minister of Finance, a popular actor and 13 unmarried women from a provincial town. \"There is too much fogginess and rain and melancholy in most of the pictures of Denmark,\" says Jørgen Leth. \"But not in my film. I would like to show you some authentic, clear and beautiful pictures from this strange country.\""
