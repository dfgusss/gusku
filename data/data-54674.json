    "overview": "Rocker Pete Jones is in trouble. He’s solo in his personal and professional life and he can’t seem to finish his long-awaited album. Threatened with bankruptcy and a lawsuit from his label, Pete turns to his lost love and former producer-turned-radio-reporter Laura Klein for help. Together, they form an eclectic group of musicians who have never met to create a band, for one day and one day only."
