    "overview": "A group of friends emerge from the darkness, bloody and lucky to be alive. Having already lost two friends in the marsh, they break into an empty vacation house to take shelter. Whatever was in the marsh is still after them, but it's not the only thing that wants them dead. Something much worse and more savage lays in wait."
