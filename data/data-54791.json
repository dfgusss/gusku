Her friends throw a party at the hotel and an idea is born to make it the \"Bikini Hotel\" with all of the staff members wearing bikinis. This elicits jealousy in the nearby Regent Hotel who wish to turn Samantha's hotel into a parking lot. It all culminates in a competition where the winner gets to stay."
