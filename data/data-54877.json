    "overview": "One year at Malpensa: four seasons spent following the bureaucracy, the procedures, the controls and the movements that are everyday occurrences inside an intercontinental airport. A public space, in which Italian and international police forces collaborate, where every gesture is captured by closed-circuit cameras, each piece of luggage is studied in all its recesses in an attempt to ward off a potential and unknown threat. A place in which fear is the only thing not in transit."
