    "overview": "Jaime is frustrated by the feeling that some time ago he let the woman who would have been the woman of his life slip away. He now lives in Madrid, is married and the father of a daughter. On the occasion of a trip he has to make to his parents' house in Pamplona, he remembers the summer of 1992 when he met Eva. There, in Pamplona, Jaime prefers to spend the San Fermín festivities in the swimming pool, lying in the sun and devoting himself to his favourite hobby: observing the girls and portraying them in his sketchbook. Jaime looks at the smallest details to classify people, especially one: he is fascinated by girls who bend their legs when they talk.  Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
