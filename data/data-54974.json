    "overview": "A wealthy member of the upper classes and his three sons withdraw to a country villa where they spend their days in complete idleness, having everything done for them by their young and beautiful maid. They surrender to the pleasure of sleep, while idleness permeates the tiny world of these living dead, with the exception of the woman who is the sole representative of positive values, will-power and action. Finally, the youngest son will try to break free."
