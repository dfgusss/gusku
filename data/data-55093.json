    "overview": "A heightened homage to the City of Angels, Electric Slide riffs on the real-life story of Eddie Dodson, the notorious \"Gentleman Bank Robber.\" With a debonair sophistication and a serious talent for flirt, Dodson managed to lure money from mesmerized female tellers at over 60 banks during an epic spree in the 1980s."
