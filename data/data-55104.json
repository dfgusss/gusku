    "overview": "El culo del mundo' is a documentary directed by and starring comedian Andreu Buenafuente, the idea for which came about three months after the cancellation of one of his last television programmes, when he received an email from a viewer. This email makes him ask himself why he dedicates himself to comedy and why he has never thought of leaving the profession after three decades. All this will be the starting point of a journey that will take this comedian and presenter deep into the heart of comedy."
