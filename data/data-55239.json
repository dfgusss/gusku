    "overview": "February, 1978. Roberto and Aurelia are Cuban exiles living in New York City with their 17-year-old daughter. For ten years Roberto's been the super of an apartment building, firing up the boiler, repairing windows, and moving bags of garbage. He's homesick for Cuba, stuck in repetitive conversations about the Bay of Pigs, Castro, and life back home.  After receiving some tragic news, Robert makes up his mind to quit the city and move to Miami."
