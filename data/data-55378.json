One day, while assisting another taxi driver, Mangal comes to the assistance of a damsel in distress, who is being molested by two thugs. Mangal gallants rescues her, and attempts to take her to her destination, to no avail, as the person she is looking for has moved. The next day, Mangal and the young woman, Mala, again attempt to seek Ratanlal, a music director, but the entire day is spent in vain.
