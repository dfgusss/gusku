    "overview": "With rumbling stomachs and no engagement, musicians Pit, Max, Bill, Gus, Eddi, and Giorgio are on their way to visit their Uncle Hermann, who runs a sports school on Lake Wörthersee. Along the way, they meet the charming teenagers Susi, Evi, Sieglinde, Inez, and Francis, who are on their way to a girls' boarding school. A strict boarding school where male visits are, of course, frowned upon. So the musicians dress up in drag and visit their friends disguised as 'aunts and cousins.' And, as expected, things soon go haywire."
