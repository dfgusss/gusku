    "overview": "Trance dances and out of body projection. In front of the camera, Parvaneh Navaï becomes a mediator who enters in contact with and immerses into the energies of Nature, while her own energy radiates and echos in the forest (\"selva\"). The camera amplifies and expands her presence, transforming the forest into an imaginary space. The camera becomes a painter's brush."
