    "overview": "Lawyers Andrew and Benjamin are friends who share a lot, but their work puts them on opposite sides. Their trials do not occur in this life but in the afterlife. They are members of the Sky Court deciding where a human soul should go after death- Heaven or Hell. Unexpectedly in one case personal interests of Andrew interfere: the man who made the proposal to his widow is on trial."
