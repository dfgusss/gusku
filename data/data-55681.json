    "overview": "A baby is washed up on a Pacific Island and is adopted by a  childless woman. The tribal priest takes an instant dislike to  the child, proclaiming him a demon. The child is deaf and mute  and therefore excluded from hunting with the other young men. Out  of loneliness, he befriends a white turtle. When a drought  befalls the island, the priest blames the silent one. When the  chief protects the boy, the priest plots the chiefs' downfall."
