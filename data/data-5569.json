If in secret, they admired and liked each other, politics still divided them as it is dividing the country. And when the mayor wants his \"People's House\"; the priest wants his \"Garden City\" for the poor. Division exist between the richest and the poorest, the pious and the atheists and even between lovers. But if the people are hard as the country, they are good in the bottom of there heart."
