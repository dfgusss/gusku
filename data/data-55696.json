He keeps his searches a secret from his live-in lover, whom he stays with the entire while. When Scott actually meets the girl, he discovers that she has been similarly motivated, even though she is married and has had two children in the meantime. They share a romantic assignation and discover that the ideal figure they were each searching for is absent."
