    "overview": "Seven-year-olds Michael and Rachel are best friends who do everything together and who have vowed to remain friends \"forever and ever and can't be parted for never and never\".  Unfortunately, the society that Michael and Rachel live in is one of religious intolerance. The fact that Michael is Irish Catholic and Rachel is Jewish is a point of conflict for just about everyone in the community."
