    "overview": "Two couples get to know what we all dream about: love at first sight. The problem is they meet it with different people to the ones they are engaged with, and they are just at seven days to get married. Up to that moment, they have to reconsider what’s love and what’s a habit, and to face them going against an idea with an expiration date: marriage. \"Love of my loves\" is based upon the successful mexican theatrical play \"Un dos tres por mí y por todos mis amores\", and explores compromise, doubts and commitment mixing drama and comedy."
