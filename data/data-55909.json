    "overview": "\"Serrallonga\" is the story of a bandit who becomes a legend, in a hard time when the struggle to survive was the main concern of a people enslaved by hunger and with banditry as one of the few exits from misery. Joan Sala, alias Serrallonga, is above all a rebel. Robberies and assaults make him admired by the people and his legend grows unstoppably until the end of his days."
