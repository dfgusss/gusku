    "overview": "\"Taken between September 1970 and May 1971, with the unmoving camera apparently bolted to the window ledge, this film, a ten-minute eternity, chronicles what takes place within view of the lens. The backdrop is a typical New York pizza stand, the actors are selected New Yorkers who happened to be there during the half year, the plot is the somewhat sinister aimlessness of life itself.\" - Donald Ritchie, Museum of Modern Art, NY.  Preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2014."
