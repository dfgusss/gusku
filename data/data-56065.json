    "overview": "Carmen (84) and Emeterio (97) are an elderly couple living out their last years in their house in Acapulco, the same house they built with their own hands. Time seems to have stopped for them; there is no day more special or less special than the one preceding it. All there is left to do is wait. Carmen and Eme survive together as they await the next visit of their family."
