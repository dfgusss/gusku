    "overview": "\"If you don't have your own plan, you'll damn sure be a part of someone else's.\" That quote kicks off the first of multiple story lines, in the crime ensemble \"Bubblegum &amp; Broken Fingers.\" This character-driven collage of sex, violence and survival is equal parts western, gangster and love stories. We follow the journey of a mysterious silver briefcase and witness the havoc it brings each new owner."
