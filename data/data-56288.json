    "overview": "Gutter punks shouldn't play with dead things...or have sex with them.  When Sarah (Tiffany Stinky) screws a corpse in the local funeral home she gets the \"ROT,\" a deadly, flesh-eating virus that soon infects her punk rock boyfriend Muzzy (Billy Scam).  Realizing they are doomed to rot alive together, Sarah and Muzzy set out on a nihilistic rampage, spreading ultra-violence and the virus in their chaotic wake.  As the plague of rotting flesh rages out of control, the FBI, secretive government agencies and Dr. Robert Olsen (Joel D. Wynkoop), the deranged scientist who created the \"ROT\", become involved, making everything far worse for the citizens of Sunnyville, Florida."
