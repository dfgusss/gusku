    "overview": "Five attempts to say the most important thing, through dumbness and fear of being misunderstood. Five steps to yourself, through the reflection in the closest people. Five breaths to go on, overcoming emptiness and fear of death, in search and finding love. Different heroes go this way with only one desire to be heard and accepted as they are. But is it possible?"
