    "overview": "During the Russian war with Afghanistan in the 1980s, journalist Charlie Palmer and medic Victor Davis arrive at a P.O.W. camp near the Afghanistan/Pakistan border in order to document the sub-human conditions which the prisoners are forced to endure. During their visit, the prisoners seize control of the camp and begin to enact a series of terrible and bloody punishments on their captors. Held as hostages, Palmer and Davis are forced to witness acts of barbarity unlike any they have ever seen before."
