    "overview": "Even though Madame Blueberry lives in a nice treehouse, and has lots of friends, she is still upset because she always thinks she needs more \"stuff\". When a new Stuff-Mart superstore opens up near her home, she loads up with everything she can, but is still sad. Eventually, Madame Blueberry learns that it's important to be thankful for what you already have."
