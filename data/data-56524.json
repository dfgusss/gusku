    "overview": "Afghanistan is a land in healing, yet it is still filled with such turbulence and turmoil that it is hardly a place one would consider for a honeymoon. Yet, that is exactly what Dr. Jean Paul Bell and Maggie Haertsch set out to do. Follow the happy couple on their harrowing journey of healing, upset and goodwill. Many of the plans on their itineraries do not work out the way they had intended, yet their resilience and adaptability always save the day, and quite possibly save their lives."
