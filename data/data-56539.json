    "overview": "Zack Wright, a pharmacist who works the graveyard shift in Brooklyn, alongside Ty Jackman, a blunt, wise-cracking pharmacy tech, would rather be stuck in Vegas as a roulette dealer rather than dreaming his nights away at Goodyear Pharmacy on Coney Island Avenue.  Several customers patronize the store, varying from idiotic to obnoxious, from beautiful to dangerous, as Zack and Ty go through the motions of another bizarre night."
