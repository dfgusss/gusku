He and his wife Maria shack up at a hotel, while each struggles separately with a drug problem. Maria manages to get a straight job, and Nigel gets a gig storing illegal goods for a local crime boss known as the President.  Things heat up when Nigel falls for Tanya, a prostitute who works for the President, and their affair makes him ever more distant from Maria. The stage is set for a sex and violence-fueled descent into mayhem that remains intelligent throughout, as the plot twists and secrets are revealed.  Maria gets pregnant and Nigel starts to snap, and the only sane one seems to be Jimmie, Nigel's existential pot dealer... \"GOOD TASTE MADE BAD TASTE!\" - Peter Jackson"
