    "overview": "A provocative look at the broken medical system in America and how our definition of health is skewed. This movie takes us through a journey into LIFESTYLE and teaches us basic things we can do every day that can enhance our health. The mechanistic model of a pill for an ill or replaceable body parts has proven to be ineffective and burdensome. Vitality is a look at how our bodies can thrive given the right inputs and habits."
