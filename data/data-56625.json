For this reason, they are summoned by mystic Noé to fight animal hunters in the Pantanal region, in Brazil, who are after animal skins and furs, and are led by the mean Morel. They accept the mission and, on their way, meet archaeologist Marcos and photographer Carla, who are in search of a lost pyramid built by the Phoenician. Together, they try to beat the hunters."
