    "overview": "A drunken, boorish general tyrannises his wife and his maid. When the wife discovers that her husband and the maid are having an affair, she turns the maid out of the house, little realising that the young woman is pregnant with the general's child. Years later, the general is dead, and a younger generation has risen with a new outlook on life and new problems to face... This flamboyantly stylised melodrama, loosely adapted from Ibsen, is the newest work by one of the legendary figures of Iran's New Wave."
