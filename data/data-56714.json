    "overview": "When the corpse of mobster Miguel \"el chino\" Sanabria surfaces, everyone thinks his death is the result of an argument during the heat of the moment. That is, everyone except Officer Ferran (Victor Mayo), who believes something more menacing was at fault. Along with Picasso (Juanko Vellido), the last person to see Sanabria alive, Ferran sets out to find the truth behind the murder -- and learns something about his own destiny in the process."
