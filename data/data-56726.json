    "overview": "A prostitute goes on vacation to a beach resort with her young daughter (who's being schooled by nuns). Everything is cheerful and pleasant at the seashore; the customers at the hotel think she's a poor widow  - she always wears black - and treat her like a lady. But when one of her former clients arrives, her carefree days on the beach are numbered."
