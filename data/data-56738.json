    "overview": "Aris, Nikos Kourkoulos, is released from prison after three years, and he turns up at Troumpa, a slum area in Piraeus. His purpose is not to settle his own accounts but to find out if Lola (Tzeni Karezi), a young woman who works at Stelios’ cabaret, was among the ones who betrayed him. Aris loves and cares about Lola and wants to get her out of there, but Stelios, who is also in love with her, assigns a thug to kill Aris."
