    "overview": "Artur London was arrested in 1951 in a Stalinist purge, imprisoned and tortured for two years and forced to confess in the Slansky Trial, one of the last Stalinist \"show trials\" in Eastern Europe. The documentary explores some of the reasons for the controversy aroused by Costa-Gavras' The Confession,  which had been accused of being anti-communist, and it highlights the political importance of filmmaking which, by its nature, is a fiction intended for the general public."
