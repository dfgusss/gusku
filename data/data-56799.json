    "overview": "From the birth of the jazz era in the 1920s through a resurgence of swing in the late 20th century, this absorbing documentary chronicles the history of bebop -- jitterbugs, hepcats, zoot suits and all -- beginning with Count Basie and Glenn Miller. Other featured legends include Benny Goodman, Dizzy Gillespie, the Les Paul Trio, Jack Teagarden, Jimmy Dorsey, Stan Kenton, Louis Armstrong, the Art Tatum All Stars and Peggy Lee. It's a gas, baby."
