    "overview": "Being a panda is fun! But not Misha, who is forced to work in a panda costume at children's parties. He is thirty years old, lives in a tiny one-room apartment on the outskirts of Moscow, and has no serious job. Everything was like that until he was invited to the birthday party of the son of an oligarch. Artyom is nine years old, and he has a secret plan that only Misha can help implement. The boy and the panda go on a journey across the country, constantly getting into incredible situations."
