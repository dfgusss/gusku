    "overview": "Asylum seeker Dudie lives in a shabby hostel for asylum seekers. Dudie is plagued by bad luck: His girlfriend lets herself be bought as a wife, a couple of beefy men want to get their hands on him and it looks like he won't be getting a job any time soon. One evening, when he is hanging out with a couple of Africans from the home, one of the men gives him an address in Berlin where he can get help. Dudi sets off for Berlin and meets Cuffi Bugudubugu. Cuffi offers him a place to live and gets him a job on a building site. His boss treats him unfairly and his co-workers despise him. But Dudi doesn't let this get him down and all sorts of crazy things happen to him: First he marries a German woman for money, then he slaughters a sheep on the building site and soon gets a job in a kebab shop..."
