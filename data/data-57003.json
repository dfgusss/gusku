    "overview": "It is not out of love that Ines gives her boyhood friend Moritz the vow, not even because he is rich. On the contrary. For the financial expert the dreamy loser type is interesting as a low-income earner. The fictitious marriage with him brings a lot of tax savings for Ines. On paper, everything is perfectly sophisticated, except for the last place after the comma. Unfortunately, a conscientious financial officer moves into the same apartment building. In order not to be unmasked as unscrupulous tax evaders, Ines and Moritz must play him the newly in love couple - with unimaginable consequences."
