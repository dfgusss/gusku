    "overview": "Explores how the quest for an elusive monster transforms those who seek it. Through the stories of hunters, scientists, and believers, the film blurs the boundary between legend and reality, suggesting that Bigfoot might be as much a reflection of human nature as a creature of the wild. Each sighting, rumor, or empty trail becomes a mirror, revealing our collective longing for mystery, connection, and the untamed. Ultimately, the film is less about finding Bigfoot and more about how the search shapes us, igniting a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the natural world."
