After many military successes during the reign of Catherine, General Suvorov broke with her successor, Paul I, the Mad Emperor, over questions regarding army policy. He went into retirement and wrote \"The Science of Victory,\" containing maxims such as \"Swiftness of movement accompanies victory,\" and \"the real general is he who defeats the enemy before reaching him.\" The czar recalled Suvorov to become the leader of the joint armies of Russia and Austria against Napoleon."
