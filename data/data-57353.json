    "overview": "Sophie Tatischeff's short film set in the small town of Sainte-Sévère-sur-Indre, three decades after its use in her father's film 'Jour de Fête'. The conversation from a typical village bar is transplanted to a patisserie with particularly tempting tartlets: 'No reason for us not to have another' says one habitué; 'no more for me thanks,' says another. 'A shortbread at this time of day?' asks the woman behind the counter."
