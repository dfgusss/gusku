    "overview": "A group of movie professionals go into a studio to, over a single day, read / test/ count / live the story of 'The Silly Ones and The Stupid Ones'. Sitting around a table and following the directions of the director, the actors show us the evolution of the creating process and how the characters through the trials, indications, lighting or props, that at first were just a story captured on a script becomes a film, in cinema, the great optical illusion, the visual lies that allows us to enjoy the stories we see on the screen."
