    "overview": "The duty of taking the tax return forms of the villagers to the big city is assigned to a naive young guy. The villagers trust him, and hand their tax return forms to him. Taking the forms along with the lunchbox full of beans his mother cooked for him, he's underway. But he meets some weird people on the way, who also run into some other weird people, and things start to follow an unexpected path for everyone involved, bringing hillarious moments along."
