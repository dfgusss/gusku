    "overview": "Taryn finds herself gaining much-desired popularity when the charismatic new girl at school claims her as a “breath sister,\" teaching Taryn about the Choking Game. Hiding it from her ever-present mother, best friend, and teachers, Taryn sees choking as a way to build self-control and grab an easy high. But, as the stakes are raised through each subsequent ‘flight’, Taryn has no idea that she is actually putting her life in extreme danger."
