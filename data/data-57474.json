    "overview": "On the border of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and the Greek village of Limya lies the frontier hamlet of Akıncılar, where the call to prayer mingles with church bells and Turkish music blends with Greek melodies, and people from Diyarbakır and Cyprus live side by side. In this village there are three children, each thirteen years old, bound together by fate and traveling a shared path. Their story unfolds amid a ritual that becomes ever more tangled: the drama of “child brides.”"
