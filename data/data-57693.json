    "overview": "Concert pianist Lotta's big comeback is imminent - but she feels that her piano playing still lacks the magic that once enchanted people so much. To regain her old inspiration, she travels alone to a small hotel in the Rheingau. Here she seeks peace and quiet. Chef Sebastian, however, believes that creative energy can only be gained through excellent food. Although Lotta initially rejects his culinary creations, he is not deterred and not only gives Lotta back her emotional connection to music, but also slowly wins her heart with his culinary creations."
