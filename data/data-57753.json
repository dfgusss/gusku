    "overview": "Building contractor Jochen Schuster takes out loans worth millions to finance a dubious building project and fulfill the extravagant wishes of his lover. When his mountain of debt is so high that no bank will grant him a loan, he comes up with an idea: he scrapes together the last of his funds and drives up to the banks in a borrowed limousine and wig and tries to borrow money under a false identity. The banks fall for the trick and grant him the loans to \"protect German cultural assets\". Schuster can hardly believe his luck and handles the unexpected windfall just as irresponsibly as before..."
