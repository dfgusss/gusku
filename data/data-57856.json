The people and the millenarian culture of Yanomami are the framework of this story about the unbreakable bonds of filiations.  After an accident in the furious flow of the mythical Orinoco River, in the fifties, Ana was considered dead. Elena as an adult and facing the negligible possibility that her mother is alive decides to leave to the Amazon to search her.  ETERNAL ASHES is a story of filiations, poetry, wisdom and especially of humanity."
