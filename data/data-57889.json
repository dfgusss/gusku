    "overview": "Charilaos (Orestis Makris), a retired officer with very strict and conservative principles, raises his four daughters with... military discipline, taking care of their culture, their appearance and their good behavior. Despite all his desire to marry them, he does not leave them anywhere alone, as a result of which no man approaches them. His wife, Efterpi (Eleni Zafiriou), as well as his friend and neighbor Xenophon (Pantelis Zervos), make remarkable efforts to convince him to change his tactics, but he insists on his very conservative behavior. But when the conversation reaches the well-to-do sister of Kalliopis (Georgia Vassiliadou) who has been living in Chicago, USA for years, everything turns upside down. She returns to Athens and undertakes to modernize the general's house, as well as help the four girls (and her nieces) to be rehabilitated."
