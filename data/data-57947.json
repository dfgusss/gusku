    "overview": "Two women, each named Helen, live out their mirrored lives in the town of Troy, NY.  The first Helen is in her 60s, is married, and takes care of a small, extremely lifelike baby doll, which she treats as a living baby.  The second Helen is in her 30s, has a successful art career and is four months pregnant.  One night, something falls from the sky and explodes over the town. In the aftermath of this event, bizarre and unexplainable things begin to happen."
