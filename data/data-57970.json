    "overview": "Smart, crude, and in-your-face, Australian comic/actor/equal-opportunity-offender Jim Jefferies is not for the faint of heart. Whether he is lampooning gun control, auditioning disabled actors, or over-sharing sexual experiences, the FXX \"Legit\" star proves nothing is out of bounds and even less, off limits. Filmed during the Boston run of his recent stand up tour."
