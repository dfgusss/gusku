    "overview": "Möhnstedt is a paradise for parking offenders and speeders - village policeman Klaus Burck turns a blind eye to such offenses. Much to the astonishment of his new colleague Eva Mann, who has just graduated from police school and doesn't understand such leniency... When Jutta Krohn reports her daughter Nina missing one day, the village lethargy is suddenly over. A short time later, her body is fished out of the village lake. Nina, a nightclub dancer, attractive but unapproachable, died after having sex with three men. When the trail leads to the powerful bakery owner Jansen and his sons, the police suddenly have half the village against them..."
