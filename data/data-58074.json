Already upset, Reiko draws the line when Darren walks into a forbidden cave, which, according to local beliefs, enshrines Shinto gods since the dawn of time. From then, Reiko and Darren start witnessing strange things happening around them, some of which they manage to catch on camera. Will they have time to understand what is upon them before it is too late?"
