    "overview": "Christian girl Rachel Whitaker goes off to college for her freshman year and begins to be influenced by her popular biology professor Marcus Kaman, who teaches that evolution is the answer to the origins of life. When Rachel’s father senses something amiss with his daughter, he begins to examine the situation and what he discovers catches him completely off-guard. Now very concerned about Rachel drifting away from her Christian faith, he sets out to do something about it."
