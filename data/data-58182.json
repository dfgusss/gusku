    "overview": "Set in a small Polish town, \"Louder Than Bombs\" tells the coming-of-age story of Marcin, a 21-year-old with a penchant for James Dean and The Smiths. After the death of his father, Marcin must contend with the funeral arrangements while hosting his buffoonish out-of-town relatives who disparage his small town life as a mechanic in his father's garage. In addition, Marcin must face the news that his lifelong girlfriend has decided to leave Poland to live in the U.S. If he doesn't act quickly, he may never see her again."
