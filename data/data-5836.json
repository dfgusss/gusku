    "overview": "Befriended by aristocrat Sebastian Flyte, Oxford student Charles Ryder finds that the power and privilege experienced by the family is seductive. On a visit to the ancestral home, Brideshead, he falls in love with his friend's sister, Julia.  However, as his ties to the Flytes deepen, Ryder finds himself at odds with their strong Roman Catholicism."
