    "overview": "Vienna, sometime around 1680:  Augustin makes fun of Leopold I mistress and in doing so, stirs up the passions of the people against the luxury-enjoying rulers, who neglect their people.  He is arrested and sent to prison.  When the plague breaks out, he manages to get out of prison, but accidentally ends up in a mass grave for victims of the plague"
