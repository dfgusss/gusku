    "overview": "This deliriously offensive, gory horror-comedy features an underground comic book artist whose obscene caricature upsets a crime lord, who responds by cutting off the young man’s hand. The young man wallows in post-severed hand depression. Will criminality reign supreme? Will he live alone as a bitter one-handed man? Not if the slightly rotted hand, now alive and determined to exact revenge, teems up with his former body and a masked S&M gay superhero to rid the city of evil."
