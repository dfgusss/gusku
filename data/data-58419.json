    "overview": "When Adam helps his nutty ex-girlfriend Miriam artificially inseminate, it turns into a one-night stand-- and they both wind up pregnant. You see, Adam has been transitioning to living as a man. Now torn between his feelings for Miriam and his need for a masculine identity, Adam must figure out whether he's going to settle down and have a baby, or just try to be one of the guys."
