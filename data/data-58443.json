    "overview": "Five unrelated tales: (1) \"The Ravishing Queen\" / \"La Reina Bella\", in which the queen choses a king by devious endurance tests of the pretendants; (2) \"The Punished Lovers\", in which a fake blind husband is 'cured' after having the culprits banished from the tribe; (3) \"The Old Prostitute\" who manages to take revenge from all the village dignitaries who wrongfully condemned her brother; (4) \"The Endless Search\" that does not end until a hunter finds his perfect end-game; (5) \"The Crazy Woman\" whose illness was not exactly of the mind, but of an (almost) insatiable lust."
