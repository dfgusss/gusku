    "overview": "Artfully directed by award-winning filmmakers Roger Weisberg and Vanessa Roth, \"Aging Out\" chronicles the daunting obstacles that three young people in foster care encounter as they \"age out\" of the system and are suddenly on their own for the first time.  \"Aging Out\" is more than a dark chronicle of young people who move from foster care into the welfare, mental health, and criminal justice systems. This emotionally complex film is also a portrait of young adults struggling to overcome the scars of their troubled childhood in order to realize their dreams of independence and fulfillment."
