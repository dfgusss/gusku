    "overview": "A documentarian strikes up an odd friendship with reclusive 80 year old outsider artist Al Carbee, whose strange Barbie-doll photography gains acclaim and interest over the course of the project's multi-year history.  Far beyond a portrait of an eccentric, Magical Universe is about wonder, friendship, and the transcendent power of creativity"
