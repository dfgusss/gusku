    "overview": "Dino is 23 and dreams of a different life. She has left the mass unemployment of the Swedish provinces in search of happiness in nouveau-riche Oslo just like hundreds of thousands of other young Swedish people. But her new life has reached a deadlock. Dino finds herself stuck in a destructive sprial of temporary jobs, financial difficulties and wild partying. When she starts an extra job as as a housekeeper in a Norwegian middle-class home, she is thrown into a reality very far from her own."
