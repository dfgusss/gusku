    "overview": "A shocking look at how a recent anti-gay amendment to a Russian propaganda law has led to increased assaults on gay men and women.  In modern-day Russia, where it is estimated that just 1% of the LGBT population lives  completely openly, a recent anti-gay amendment to a “propaganda” law has been  followed by a rising number of assaults on gay men and women by vigilantes who,  more often than not, go unpunished for their crimes."
