    "overview": "Jeanne Kern is a pretty, somewhat repressed schoolteacher who suffers a smear campaign at work. Someone has been sending her director letters accusing her of lewd and immoral conduct. Matters take a turn for the worse when a photograph of an orgy is sent to all the faculty with one face cut out; presumably, the face is hers."
