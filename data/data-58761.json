    "overview": "6 college students from different backgrounds, are assigned to work together on a final project. These six students have so far spent no time together, can't stand each other and must pass this final assignment in order to pass the class. The assignment is to create a utopian society, on paper. They've had all semester to work on the project but in the tradition of most college group assignments, have opted to wait until the last minute to cram the entire semester's work into one night."
