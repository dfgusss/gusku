    "overview": "Baz, a Lebanese Australian soldier, accidentally enters a top secret Israeli communications base. Knowing he is in the wrong place at the wrong time, Baz surprises Bob, an American soldier, with a punch in the face and Ari, an Israeli soldier, with a chokehold. Once the two enemies are tied up, Baz tries to leave, but the door to the base, which has closed behind him, has a time mechanism that will keep it locked for the next six hours. Trapped and convinced that once the door is reopened they could all be executed, the three are forced to confront each other. This will allow them to overcome personal prejudices and give life to a friendship with dramatic but also hilarious consequences."
