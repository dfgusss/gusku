    "overview": "Maha has always been passionate about cinema, and as a set designer she's become an expert at creating imaginary worlds. Under immense pressure at work, she sights another life on the horizon and begins slipping between realities-one resembling the film set she's designed and the other her supposed real life. As she grows ever more entangled in each, the border between reality and imagination becomes blurred, and she must choose for the first time what she truly desires."
