    "overview": "Before there was Disneyland, there was Coney Island.  By the turn of the century, this tiny piece of New York real estate was internationally famous.  On summer Sundays, three great pleasure domes--Steeplechase, Luna Park and Dreamland--competed for the patronage of a half-million people.  By day it was the world's most amazing amusement park, by night, an electric \"Eden\"."
