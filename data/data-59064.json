    "overview": "Jeff Dunham and his iconic creations, Achmed, Walter, Peanut, and Bubba J. have embarked on an unprecedented world tour through five continents, logging almost 100,000 miles and starring in arenas where few American comedians have dared to perform. Tell the wrong joke in Singapore or United Arab Emirates and risk being handcuffed before you ever leave the stage. Bring Achmed the Dead Terrorist on stage in Malaysia after a government warning forbidding his presence, and you may never leave Kuala Lumpur. While Dunham crafts pop culture references that can excite a local audience upon entering each country, Jeff shows that humor is truly universal. Most of the time."
