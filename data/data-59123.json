    "overview": "What happens when you grow up in a rich, dysfunctional, white trash family that runs a restaurant that your deceased father built with his blood and sweat? Well, if you're Steve Boyle, you turn into a prick. Steve, the youngest of nine brothers, has a dream to run the Boyles' restaurant but his overbearing family, his lust for Joyce the waitress and his jealousy of  Victor, the most perfect human being to walk the earth, stand in Steve's way. Through many conversations with Steve's best friend and co-worker Carlos, he just might find a way to win back Joyce, become the proud owner of Boyles, and earn the respect of his family!"
