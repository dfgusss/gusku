    "overview": "Life could be so good for the children of Bollersdorf if the town had not been discovered by the Society for Consumer Research because of its mediocrity. New products are to be tested here. The market researchers know that what the people of Bollersdorf like sells well everywhere. But while the local parents enthusiastically take part, their children quickly get fed up with the annoying product testers. Even more so when they want to send their beloved grandmas and grandpas to a care home to bring the average age back into line. This is a case for the coati gang! Together with the clever coati Quatsch, the children hatch a clever plan: With adventurous inventions and crazy world records, they want to prove Bollersdorf's uniqueness so that the consumer researchers finally disappear again..."
