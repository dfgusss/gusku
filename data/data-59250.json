    "overview": "Vienna, circa 1930: The \"sweet Viennese girl\" Marianne is supposed to find the man of her life in the butcher Oskar. She flees to the bon vivant Albert, who first makes her pregnant and then bitterly disappoints her. He abandons her, leaving Marianne all alone with the child. She loses all willpower and, in complete resignation, finally marries the stuffy Oskar."
