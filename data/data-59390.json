    "overview": "There lives a couple known as \"100-year-old lovebirds\". They're like fairy tale characters: the husband is strong like a  woodman, and the wife is full of charms like a princess. They dearly love each other, wear Korean traditional clothes together, and still fall asleep hand in hand. However, death, quietly and like a thief, sits between them. This film starts from that moment, and follows the last moments of 76 years of their marriage."
