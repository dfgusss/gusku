    "overview": "A group of people have just signed up to be camp Councillors at a foreign country.  They expect the camp to be the place for a memorable summer.  Instead, something strange is going on and some of the campers begin to act strange.  Things go terribly wrong real fast as a terrible game of tag has the campers running for their lives or going after the campers."
