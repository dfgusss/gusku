    "overview": "Dimitris Papaioannou's new piece is a  \"dissection of the male psyche,\" and seems to draw upon a range of influences including the work of Jean Genet, Rene Magritte and Robert Wilson. Inspiration for the show also came partly from Papaioannou's own experiences as a gay man in Greece."
