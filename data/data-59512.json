    "overview": "Brest, the end of the world. A young woman's foot is found near the sea. Alma Schneider, a cop fresh from Paris, leads the investigation. She can only count on the support of César Istria, forensic pathologist and passionate archaeologist. Together, they find the site where the victim is believed to have been buried. But the body they exhume is not that of a woman! It's that of a man, probably a sailor. Not one murder to solve, but two... And the mystery thickens still further when they realize that the young woman was in fact a transsexual named Diana, a veritable icon and influential figure in the whole town. Alma and César join forces to solve this enigma, which takes them deep into the bowels of Brest."
