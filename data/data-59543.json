Later, when they begin to work in a circus, they discover that the child is in fact the daughter of the trapeze artist and that she was forced to surrender her daughter to a gang that negotiates children abroad. This gang finds them and tries to recover the girl who now, however, has the help of the Trapalhões to protect her."
