    "overview": "In this love story with Hitchcockian overtones, a computer chip salesman meets the perfect girl (a brilliant software developer) -- and then she disappears. After Jack Livingstone (Justin Kunkle) finds Julie Romanov (Jenn Gotzon) through an Internet dating service, he's convinced life is perfect. But when she vanishes, he's left distraught and confused. Turning to Julie's mother (Hitchcock vet Tippi Hedren), he learns a startling revelation."
