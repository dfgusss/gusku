    "overview": "A volatile, oil-rich Nigerian community wages war against their corrupt government and a multi-national oil corporation to protect their land from being destroyed by excessive drilling and spills.  To seek justice, a rebel organization kidnaps an American oil executive and demands that his corporation end the destruction and pollution.  Inspired by true events, Black November is the gripping story of how a community rises up and takes drastic measures to make sure their voices are heard."
