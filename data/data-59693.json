    "overview": "A psychological drama/thriller, that takes you into the heart of dysfunctional family life. Dawn's struggle with her past is played out not only upon the couch during regression therapy but also within the family home. With the help of Josh's method of escapism; a penchant for viewing life through a lens, we learn from his footage the extent and impact this situation has had over the years. Vulnerable and unable to articulate their worries, teenagers Josh &amp; Nicola struggle with their mum's more recent bout of outbursts and her increasing instability. They forge relationships outside of the family unit; to escape in Nicola's case and for support whilst they try to maintain some sense of a 'normal' existence. As relationships at home become frayed, suspicions about Dawn's therapist's integrity &amp; motivations arise. Dawn is sectioned and social services are informed."
