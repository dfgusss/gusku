    "overview": "An aged, above suspicion, bourgeois man known as ‘The Master’ lives isolated in a luxurious beachfront villa with his teenage daughter. In reality, however, he is involved in an illicit trade in antiquities, acts as a loan shark, and trades antiquities on the black market. The ‘Master’ has two henchmen, Mercury and John, who both commit fatal mistakes. Mercury falls for the daughter of ‘Master’, while John becomes obsessed with a prostitute. Both of them, as ‘sentimentalists’, must be eliminated."
