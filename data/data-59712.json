    "overview": "Cody and his wife Judy are invited to a soiree at Elizabeth's house to celebrate his best friend Mike and Jenny's engagement. Elizabeth is Mike's boss - and also a woman Cody makes no secret of his own lusting and fantasizing over! It doesn't help that Cody is drunk and obnoxious. His boorish quips endear him to few, as he endures a clash of personalities with every other guest... Although to Mike and Elizabeth, he's the life and soul of the party."
