    "overview": "Arnold \"The Governator\" Schwarzenegger and Mel Gibson aren't the only conservative thinkers in Tinseltown. Challenging the notion that every actor is a raging liberal, this deft documentary (directed by former Democratic speechwriter Jesse Moss) talks to some of the less-publicized \"righties\" -- including Pat Sajak, Drew Carey, Patricia Heaton and Ben Stein -- to find out what it's really like to live and work in \"liberal Hollywood.\""
