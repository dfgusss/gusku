    "overview": "Everyone's off to the seaside- by car, truck and train. Not wanting to miss out, the mole starts digging. When he gets there it's nice and quiet with just a few crabs and a sailing boat to keep him company. But then the hordes arrive. And no matter where he pops his head out of the sand, there's no room for a mole anymore. It's not until night time, when the moon shines on all the leftover rubbish, that things quiet down again."
