    "overview": "Macropolis is the story of two toys discarded from a factory production line. Coming to life, they rebel and chase the factory delivery van in the hope of rejoining their friends. Lost in the unfamiliar, urban big city, they are overwhelmed by the challenge ahead. By reinterpreting the world that now surrounds them, through their unique perspectives, they begin to play with littered everyday objects to find their way back.  Shot using a unique mix of stop-motion animation and time-lapse photography on the streets of Belfast, MACROPOLIS is a modern-day fable with a striking visual appearance."
