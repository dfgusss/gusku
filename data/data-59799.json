After a tryst with Adam, Bridgette scores a role in a big play, but then learns that a former boyfriend is dying of AIDS. While preparing to get tested, Bridgette suspects Adam of cheating on her, and must face the HIV tests alone, which shockingly come back positive. Building a support network, including a penitent Adam, Bridgette faces her own mortality."
