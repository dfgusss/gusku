    "overview": "Christine and her friend Linda live together and get on very well - except when it comes to men. While Christine is still mourning her ex-boyfriend, Linda takes things like sex and relationships rather casually. Barbara, the third in the group, is completely different: she has been in steady hands for seven years and still believes in the one great love."
