    "overview": "Ayumi Nitta is a member of a hospital cleaning staff and suffers from extreme social anxiety. After having a one-night stand with genius surgeon and sex addict Wataru Makino, Ayumi discovers she’s pregnant. However, when she tells Wataru, he dismisses her claim as a bad April Fools joke. Refusing to believe he could possibly be the father of Ayumi’s baby after just one night together, Wataru takes a woman named Reiko on a date to an Italian restaurant. However, Ayumi also shows up, leading to a major incident."
