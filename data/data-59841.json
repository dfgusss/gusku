    "overview": "It's a remote-controlled helicopter that also makes a farting noise, like a flying whoopee cushion. The infomercial is hosted by a young, fast-talking, super-enthused kid who shows all the hilarious ways fartcopter can be used to make your friends laugh. Oh, and also if you switch fartcopter to DRONE mode, it becomes a military-grade killing machine. Kids love that too!"
