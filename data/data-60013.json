    "overview": "On the night of her 30th birthday, Lindsay Corwin, an  unlucky environmentalist with a string of bad relationships,  decides to make the ultimate wish: for all of her birthday  wishes to come true. When her nearly three decades of  wishes, including everything from losing weight to meeting  Mr. Right, start magically coming true all at once, Lindsay  is awestruck—until she realizes the life, and the man, she’s  always wished for might not be the one she really wants."
