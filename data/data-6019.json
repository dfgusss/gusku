    "overview": "Fueled by a raging libido, Wild Turkey, and superhuman doses of drugs, Thompson was a true \"free lance, \" goring sacred cows with impunity, hilarity, and a steel-eyed conviction for writing wrongs. Focusing on the good doctor's heyday, 1965 to 1975, the film includes clips of never-before-seen (nor heard) home movies, audiotapes, and passages from unpublished manuscripts."
