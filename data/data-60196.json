    "overview": "Gracie knows hangovers. She's intimately acquainted with them. But this one? Why did she wake up, half-dressed, on a Florida beach, 1100 miles from home? And this time her father - who also knows about the tragedy of addiction from his struggles with Gracie's mom - isn't going to clean things up."
