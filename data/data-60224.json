    "overview": "On the outskirts of the monastic state stands the small, neglected Bartenstein Castle. Its residents are exceptionally exceptional Teutonic Knights. Their swords are deadly.... For themselves. Not far from the castle, a village of clever craftsmen flourishes, and Polish-Lithuanian partisans prowl the woods. The search for the ancient treasure of the Prussians coincides with an unexpected visit of the Grand Master along with an even less expected guest."
