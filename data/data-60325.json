    "overview": "This MTV film dramatizes the horrific hate-crime killing of 21-year-old Matthew Shepard in Wyoming. In 1998, Shepard, a gay college student, was savagely beaten by Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney, who left their victim to die. Flashbacks paint a picture of Shepard's life and provide insight into why the killers, who initially set out to rob the young man, would commit such a brutal murder."
