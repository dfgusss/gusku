The killer’s motive is unknown and the teenagers question why this is happening to them. With the killer holding vigil at the basement door, the teenagers soon realize they’re trapped, as the only way out is the very same way they got in. As events unfold, questions of their own sanity come to light and reality becomes distorted."
