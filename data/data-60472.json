The moon falls into a meat grinder, whimsical, but typically Maximovian creatures, entering or not entering into some kind of relationship, are formed from moon stuffing, and eventually, after many transformations, the dog turns out to be patiently waiting for this on the \"other edge\" of the screen, gets a bone."
