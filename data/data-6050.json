    "overview": "'Chance' is a black comedy about how hard it is to find \"the one\". Mostly told from the point-of-view of a young, sexually aggressive woman, named Chance, whom according to her: \"we're all out there looking for true love\", which turns out to be a very elusive thing indeed, and Chance is no exception. She's desperately on the prowl for a man, but since she's more mouse than cat, she gets herself into scrape after scrape in her screwball pursuit of love. Surrounded by a bevy of adoring but completely wrong-for-her men (and one dead girl from Manchester, England), Chance has to pick her way through her messy life in order to figure out which guy is \"it\"."
