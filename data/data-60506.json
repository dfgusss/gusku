    "overview": "Ma and Pa Baxter have battled bears, floods, rattlesnakes, hunger, disease, and ornery neighbors for years, but somehow they've prevailed during the toughest pioneer times. Now it's their son, Jody, who will face his own set of challenges. Young Jody Baxter is growing up fast on his parents' modest farm. With three brothers and sisters lost to illness, he's had to work the land just as hard as his daddy. When his only real friend goes \"to visit the angels,\" Jody gets lonely and longs for a pet to share his life. \"Flag,\" an orphaned fawn is his new adopted playmate. With a rekindled spirit, Jody and Flag become an inseparable pair - playing, exploring, and discovering their youthful world. But the new-found joy is only temporary; Flag has become a powerful yearling. When he threatens the family's survival, Jody is faced with the toughest choice of his young life."
