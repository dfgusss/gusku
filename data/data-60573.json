    "overview": "Julia has a good job and has two children with the caring Paul. But there are antidepressants in the kitchen drawer. She had imagined her life so differently when she was young and fantasized about it with her brother Jimmy. Their tragic farewell was twenty years ago, but still gnawing at her. After a fight with Paul, Julia decides to change course radically. She leaves - in the spirit of Jimmy - for the Portuguese Algarve. As she gets to know the mysterious gigolo Romeo, Julia's past comes closer than ever."
