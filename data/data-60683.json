    "overview": "She is a quick-tempered and feisty Turkish woman; he, a shy and reticent, young Flemish man. Their respective families hold strong – perhaps too strong – opinions on the imminent marriage, and, on the big day, chaos ensues, making the young couple question their own readiness to commit to a union for life. Are their backgrounds really so different to tear them apart?"
