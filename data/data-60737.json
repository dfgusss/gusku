Somehow, Irv's gotten trapped inside a plastic snow globe, and now a couple of kids named Heidi and Alex are going to have to team up with the heroes from their favorite fairy tales like Cinderella, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Pinocchio, in order to make sure Christmas happens for boys and girls all over the world."
