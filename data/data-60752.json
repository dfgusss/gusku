    "overview": "A coming-of-age film about two sixty-year-old best buddies who should have come-of-age a long time ago. When Marriage and Family Therapists, Dave and Joel, set off for a San Francisco Therapy Conference, with the intention of hiring Escorts as an escape from their own failing marriages, they wind up in the pathway of a scheming prostitute named Roxie. This encounter with Roxie will prove to be the biggest test of Dave and Joel's friendship."
