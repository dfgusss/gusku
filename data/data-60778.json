After witnessing one of the cartel's thugs murder his best friend, White goes on a vengeance quest. He'll stop at nothing-not even the LAW-to find the cartel leaders and arrest them. But there are obstacles in White's path: the hot new street drug STAMP, plucky reporters, mysterious vigilantes, and even the Mayor of Chicago, Dennis (David Liebe Hart)."
