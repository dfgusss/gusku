Four individuals present themselves to the castle to contribute to a kind of auction, but the girl, route to all sexual experiences while still a virgin, prefers to set out and lose virginity with a young knife thrower who is, incidentally, also the queen's lover. Kidnapped, finally, by an actor of avant-garde theater, Baby Love chooses to live with him in a hermitage, while mother and buyers remain with egg on the face?"
