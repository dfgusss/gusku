    "overview": "Nina and Mark wish for years in vain a child. An adoption is out of the question for them, they would like to have their \"own\" child. There seems to be only one solution left for her: a surrogate mother in India. A business model that specific physicians and clinics specialize in the field. Euphorically, Nina and Mark travel to their foreign country. Everything seems perfect at first, the doctor Kamalika acts competent and in the young Shanti they quickly find the right surrogate mother for their desired baby. But in the nine months to the birth they begin to wonder if the decision was right."
