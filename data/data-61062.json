    "overview": "2015: Hell is in chaos. A host of new sinners arrive every day to crowd Minos' offices. But Hell is an old, antiquated structure: the new sinners, not finding a right place, are dispersed among the circles. Lucifer is received directly by God, who seeks a solution. The winning idea is a cataloging of the new sins on Earth. And who to entrust the task to if not Dante Alighieri, who already once, in his time, carried out this task with excellent results? Dante is thus catapulted into a large Italian city, and finally finds his guide, the one who will accompany him in search of the \"new sins\": Demetrio Virgilio, a precarious thirty-year-old who is preparing, like every morning, to face another \"day of Hell\"."
