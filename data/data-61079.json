    "overview": "With a simple plot and not much else, this undistinguished western is about Gabe (Jack Beutel), a rodeo name whose penchant for gambling causes him to lose all the money he made and quickly look for a steady job. Gabe ends up on a ranch plugging away as a cowhand but cannot escape his affinity for horses. Lou (Steve Keyes) and his sister Nancy (Madalyn Trahey) own the ranch and Lou comes into conflict with Gabe when he decides to kill a wild Palomino. Gabe will not allow it because he knows the stallion can be tamed. Environmentalists and others should enjoy the bloopers which put moose in Oklahoma, a raccoon in the 'possum family, and several animals in the wrong proximity."
