    "overview": "Declared \"a tale from a New Age witch hunt,\" George Paul Csicsery's documentary exposes the malpractices of the mental health and legal community during one family's harrowing ordeal. In 1990, 15-year-old Nicole accused her father of molesting her and claimed a host of bizarre incidents had happened, including satanic rituals, a murder and sex orgies. The family tries to piece together the truth despite overzealous prosecutors and therapists."
