    "overview": "During a layover in Albuquerque, work colleagues Les and Natalie discover more about each other than they ever thought possible.  Anxious and irritable, Les is drawn back into the city by past experiences he can’t forget (even if he doesn't really remember the particulars of his previous drunken adventure).  Natalie, refusing to leave his side, follows along as her own secrets are slowly revealed, leaving her feeling both vulnerable and unbound."
