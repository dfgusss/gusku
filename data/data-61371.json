    "overview": "Loosely inspired in some plays from the Spanish author Federico Garcia Lorca(\"The Puppet Play of Don Cristóbal\", \"The Billy-Club Puppets\" and \"Doña Rosita the Spinster\"), this short does an incredibly job capturing all the poetry from those literary works, adding a new level of beauty to them by the art of puppetry and stop-motion animation.  \"Cabaret\" starts as a bizarre comedy filled with many extravagances, then, it quickly evolves into a heart-breaking (But at the same time, captivating) tragedy, filled with a breathtaking lyricism that leads into a memorable ending, having some of the most beautiful lines that have been ever spoken in any animated film."
