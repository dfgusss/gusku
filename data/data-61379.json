    "overview": "Ted \"Black Lightning\" Patrick's practice of \"deprogramming,\" also known as \"reverse brainwashing,\" started in the early 1970s and quickly snowballed into a vast underground movement composed of concerned parents, ex-cultists-turned-deprogrammers and some sympathetic law-enforcers whose mission was to physically and mentally remove individuals from cults."
