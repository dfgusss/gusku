    "overview": "Bjarne runs a moving company with his wife Malin, but it is shaky and they need to borrow money. Across the river lives Bjarnes father Halvar. The two have never pulled evenly, which stems from a 20-year conflict filled with idle words, grumpy pride and stubborn prestige. In order to rescue the firm Malin sees no alternative but to go across the river to ask Halvar to cater for the loan. A decision that will have unexpected consequences."
