    "overview": "Katherine is a typical teenager. Today's her funeral. The four adults in her life have a lot on their mind - and it's not all about Katherine either. With a frankness that's strikingly disarming as well as frequently self-serving, the grown-ups struggle with being... well... grown-up."
