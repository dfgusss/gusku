    "overview": "Love &amp; Taxes is a riveting comic tale of seven years of tax avoidance. Following the possibly real-life exploits of Josh Kornbluth, an autobiographical monologist, Love &amp; Taxes is a comedy that blends solo performance and scripted scenes to bring the subjective reality of the storyteller hilariously to life. A tale of procrastination, making movies and growing up, Love &amp; Taxes is a middle-aged coming-of-age story that is also, quite possibly, the first ever pro-tax romantic comedy."
