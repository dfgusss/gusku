Arjun and Karan grow up as brothers, and Arjun takes charge of all criminal activities after Suraj passes away. Karan has fallen in love with Bindiya, the daughter of Suraj's deceased employee, and would like her to marry him. But Bindiya is in love with Saahil, and only likes Karan. Karan now decides to take the matter into his own hands, and thereby force Arjun to take sides either for him or against him."
