    "overview": "\"All-Stars\" is a hilarious commentary on the state of all youth sports today, fueled by the outrageous behavior of the desperate sports parent living vicariously through his or her child. In the vein of \"Best in Show\", where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - \"All-Stars\" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids. The end result is a funny, yet compelling spin on fast pitch softball as well as a unique state of affairs on the outlandish antics of a few crazed parents."
