    "overview": "In February 2004, after 30 years of my life in SoHo, I made a decision to leave SoHo  and move to Greenpoint, Brooklyn. This video is about what it feels like to leave a  place in which one has spent more time than any other place, and which was also  the place of my family life. I am somewhere else now. It’s about beginning of growing roots in a new place, new home, with new friends, new thoughts, experiences.  This video is also about video. When in 1949 I began filming with my Bolex, it  took me fifteen years to really master it so that my Bolex would do for me what I  wanted. When in 1987 I got my first Sony camera I thought it would be different.  But no. Only today, after working with the video camera for fifteen years, I feel like it had become an extension of my eye, my body, \"A Letter from Greenpoint\" being my first real video work."
