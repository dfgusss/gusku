    "overview": "Melvin Byrd, who dreams of being a scientist, is a Cape Kennedy \"miniscule molecular particle surveillance monitor\" - in short, a janitor. His job is to keep a major rocket project completely dust-free, and this he does with his own hilariously fantastic inventions - including a literal attack on dirt by a \"knight on a white horse\". In his work, he meets Judy, a chimp involved in a top-secret project, which leads Melvin into the one room strictly off-limits to him. Not until he has entered the project room does Melvin learn that any man entering it will be negatively ionized - making him fly like a bird."
