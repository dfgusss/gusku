    "overview": "Tibi and his small‐time crook crew haven’t grown wiser in ten years and are hired by a shadowy Japanese syndicate to steal a priceless data drive. Clueless about IT, they drag along a computer‐science teacher, only to trigger revenge from a Roma mafia boss, face off against Japanese hitmen and even anger the Slovak army. As their dream of escaping to a Malibu beach with the loot fades, Tibi’s street smarts might be their only hope."
