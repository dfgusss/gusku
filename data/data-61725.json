    "overview": "Aimo and Milla live together at her alcoholics-turned-zombies parents' place, while saving money to move out. Due to his lack of self confidence, Aimo wastes their savings to turbo-boost his muscles, and eventually to turn himself into a robot. Milla doesn't like this new Aimo and leaves him. Aimo's heartache leads him to give up his heart for a metal one, one that doesn't hurt. Milla decides to steal Aimo heart: after all, a woman needs to have a man's heart. Lovemilla is an anarchic comedy trip, a story about love, robots and bodybuilding."
