    "overview": "Sergey visits the psychoanalyst Bryusov, who at each session inspires him with the idea of divorce from his wife. \"Family is not the main thing! The main thing is what you want!\" According to Bryusov, his wife suppresses his own \"EGO\" in him. Lenochka, Sergei's wife, goes to confession to the priest, Father Sergius. The father, unlike the psychoanalyst, punishes Lenochka, at all costs to save the family. \"Family is the main thing! All for the sake of the family!\" This confrontation between the psychoanalyst and the priest has been going on for a year and a half. Who will win?"
