    "overview": "Rookie Alexey Gavrilov ends up in a unit where hazing reigns. He resists as much as he can to the three \"grandfathers\" who, on the eve of demobilization, decide to recoup as much as possible on the \"turtles\" for past humiliations. He soon finds a like-minded person. Unable to break the will of the obstinate, the \"grandfathers\" carry out a vile provocation, and then Alexei decides to take a desperate step."
