    "overview": "Writer Henry Miller, the colossus of Big Sur, at work, living in, revising old haunts in Brooklyn and Paris. He generously reveals how he saw his era, his peers and himself. He recalls his painful youth and his struggle to survive as a writer. He talks about art, dreams, and the allure of Paris. He reads passages from his works and enjoys himself with friends. What emerges is Miller’s charm, his gentleness and his lust for life."
