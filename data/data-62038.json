    "overview": "The landscape surveyed here might be the estranged interior of your typical East-European émigré animator’s skull; with its deranged narrative values, artfully disturbed graphic style, and aggressive \"musique concrète\" sonorities, Kamler's are among the most astounding works you'll ever see...  In company of Walerian Borowczyk, Peter Foldes & Arcady, Kamler is the successor to a prestigious tradition of East European émigré animators (think: Alexieff, Bartosch, Starewycz). Like their precursors, they are also among the most distinguished artists in cinema, celebrated for their graphic style and narrative experiment."
