    "overview": "After getting his heart broken by his childhood sweetheart, Tom Campbell escaped from his home town to join the military. Years later, Tom returns home with the news of his grandmother’s failing health and business.  A town treasure, Cupid’s is known for its enchanting reputation of guiding guests to find love. Chelsea, the mayor and Tom’s ex-flame, takes advantage of this bad news and devises a scheme to get the property sold to make way for a mall. Although pressured to save the bed and breakfast, Tom’s history of heart break makes it difficult to stand up for such a symbol of love. Sharing in his skepticism of love is Nancy, a new police officer in town. With Nancy’s encouragement, Tom just might make the effort to keep the landmark afloat after all."
