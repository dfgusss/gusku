Witness three tales, told by a hooded monk on  the titular Channel 13. A video game geek returns from some arcade fun to watch movies  on TV and can only get reception on Channel 13. He views tales of decadence and horror, containing  killer scarecrows, monster birds, and cannibal spaghetti farm owners!"
