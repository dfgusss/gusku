    "overview": "Set during the Arab-Israeli war of 1967, this epic drama is both the personal story of a middle-class Bahraini family and an account of the hopes and faith the Arab world had in Jamal Abdul Nasser as its leader. Intimately told, it skillfully interweaves the personal and the general to reveal a society built on male domination and female sacrifice, as women attempt to enjoy freedom of choice."
