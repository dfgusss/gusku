    "overview": "Yuzuru asked Touji out as a half-hearted joke, not expecting to be taken seriously. Touji accepted, and Yuzuru knew he was like the rest, the relationship begins on a Monday and ends on Sunday. What he did not expect was the feelings that went beyond friendship that emerged. It's now Friday, and the end is approaching. But is it? Yuzuru may be mourning the inevitable, but what about Touji? Friday begins the end, but Sunday reveals all."
