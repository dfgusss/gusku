    "overview": "Polish history is filled to the brim with diversity, so the idea transforming it into a gripping tale was a very exciting challenge. We created an exciting trip back in time that takes you through 1000 years of history in about 8 minutes. We picked 140 events that feature 500 animated characters from different historical periods. The film was created to represent Poland at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai."
