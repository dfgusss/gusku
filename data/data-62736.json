    "overview": "In Prairie Roundup, Fred F. Sears' direction brings a welcome jolt of vitality to Columbia's aging \"Durango Kid\" western series. Once again, Charles Starrett stars as Steve Carson, a lawman who is forced to assume the identity of masked do-gooder Durango. Framed for murder, Carson escapes to locate the real killer. It turns out that he was set up by cattle baron Buck Prescott, who eliminates competition by stealing livestock from other ranchers."
