    "overview": "Dusty's Trail is an inspirational documentary about a young man's journey with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a fatal and debilitating muscle wasting condition that affects one in 3,500 boys worldwide. The story tells about people coming together from around the world to climb a mountain in Borneo for charity to raise awareness for Duchenne. Dusty's Trail celebrates life through ties that bind all humanity. It's about the power of creating a positive, happy, fulfilling and inspiring life when the odds seem against it. Filmed in Borneo and California, the documentary is based on interviews with doctors, researchers, parents, friends and people who have been inspired by Dusty's life, some with whom he has never met, and others who share the same path."
