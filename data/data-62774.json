The ensuing investigation led to an innocent young man being charged with the crime, thus changing the face of journalism forever.  Directed by Greg Barker (Manhunt) and executive produced by Emmy Award-winning producer Jonathan Chinn (American High) and Academy Award-winning producer Simon Chinn (Man on Wire)."
