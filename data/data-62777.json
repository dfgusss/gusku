    "overview": "Le Mirage is the perspective of a man in his thirties asking himself \"what am I chasing?\" Our society has become all about consumerism, if not excess. Success is determined by what and how much we have and \"stuff\" becomes the band-aid to a meaningless existence. Stuff fills the void of the existence we weren't meant to lead."
