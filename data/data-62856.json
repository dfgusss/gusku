    "overview": "Persian Series #6 begins with what appears to be dried red and yellow rose petals, suddenly shot-thru with blue which causes a shift to violets and greens. This mash of colors thickens and is scored by white and then black, calligraphic lines, which are \"echoed\" in all previous floral colors whose \"dance\" seems to turn clock-wise and \"explode\" into fiery reds."
