    "overview": "Sharp edged \"chunks\" of color set in black, straight, often multicolored, lines piercing shapes, imprisoning them, until they are fragmented bits of color in black: repeat of this theme again and again until darkness prevails, but is then broken open by pure white shards and \"spears\" restoring the original \"dance\" of hard-edge shapes and lines, which then begin to whirl clockwise, interspersed with fade-outs, and then shatter into \"confetti\" texture, in black, burnt \"sugar-shapes\" and the overwhelming flare of yellow."
