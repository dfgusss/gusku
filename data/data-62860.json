    "overview": "\"Twigs\" of color in space, and pure white \"ghosts\" of them in the background interspersed with dark amalgams of these and conglomerate forms. The resolve of these themes is a combination of \"amalgams\" and \"ghosts\" at one in interplay, and then dark slashed spaces with \"webs\" of white, webbed spaces on white and, finally, solarization of colored forms - midst which the frame-line rises from bottom and drifts a few seconds visible, creating an insubstantiality of the frame of these images."
