    "overview": "Orania is a remote village in the barren centre of South Africa, an \"intentional community\" where only white Afrikaans people live - a culturally homogeneous place in a multicultural country. What lies beneath this peculiar societal experiment? A feature-length documentary about cultural identity and the thin line between self-determination and discrimination."
