    "overview": "This film series explores many aspects of our society.  To rethink what is possible in our world, we need to consider what kind of world we want to live in.  Although we refer to it as civilization, it is anything but civilized.  Visions of global unity & fellowship have long inspired humanity, yet the social arrangements up to the present have largely failed to produce a peaceful and productive world.  While we appear to be technically advanced, our values and behaviors are not.  The possibility of an optimistic future is in stark contrast to our current social, economic, and environmental dilemmas.  The Choice Is Ours includes interviews with notable scientists, media professionals, authors, and other thinkers exploring the difficulties we face."
