    "overview": "The special was filmed at Bimbo’s 365 Club in San Francisco and centers on Leggero as she “elegantly examines the many reasons why having kids is problematic, the absurdities of Burning Man, Mormons, Hipsters and more. From conservative Republicans to her very own diamond p***y, Leggero’s special proves that no one and nothing is off limits.”"
