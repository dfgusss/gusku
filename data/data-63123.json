    "overview": "When even the most unfit and unruliest recruits start pouring into the Police Academy, vice-director Beton Haşmet’s trademark iron discipline is pushed to its limit. As Haşmet doubles down on crackdown after crackdown, he loses control - and the academy, once a byword for rigidity, transforms into a playground of hilarity even as his own life slides into an unfolding nightmare."
