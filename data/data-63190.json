    "overview": "A candid journey into the world of 4 young Canadian women who work as well-paid hostesses in exclusive Japanese nightclubs. Lured by adventure and easy money, these modern-day geisha find themselves caught up in the mizu shobai—the complex \"floating water world\" of Tokyo clubs and bars. Drawn by fast money, some women become consumed by the lavish lifestyle and forget why they came; one hostess calls this \"losing the plot.\" With a pulsating visual style, Tokyo Girls captures the raw energy of urban Japan and its fascination with the new."
