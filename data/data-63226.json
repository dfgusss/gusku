    "overview": "Erin, a struggling actress, has little faith in men. She works for a detective agency, her job is to seduce married men and let their wives catch them in the act. But lately, Erin is been getting threatening phone calls and someone is trying to hurt her. Is it her boss, who's in-love with her? or is it a former \"client\" trying to get back at her? or maybe, this new man she's been seeing?"
