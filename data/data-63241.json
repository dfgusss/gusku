    "overview": "In the depths of a British legend, the ghost of Eleanor Canterville is condemned to haunt the castle of his family and to scare away any inhabitant. It fulfills this task perfectly, helped by Gwilherm, his faithful servant. But when Otis, a family fleeing Parisian life, buy the castle, Eleanor is upset because she cannot scare this tribe of the twenty-first century. Worse yet, children ridicule and parents are unaware. Only Virginia Otis, aged fifteen, moved by the fate of Canterville Ghost, will seek to deliver from curse on it."
