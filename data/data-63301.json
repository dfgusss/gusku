    "overview": "After their plane crashes off the coast of a deserted Pacific island, the surviving members of an American soccer team find themselves in the most dire of circumstances with limited resources, dwindling food supply and no rescue coming any time soon.  Team spirit evaporates as disagreements cause the group to separate into factions - a violent one lead by an unbalanced ruler, and a compassionate one led by a selfless player."
