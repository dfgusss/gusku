    "overview": "The Island of the Lost (German: Die Insel der Verschollenen) is a 1921 German silent science fiction film . It is a loose unauthorized adaptation of the 1896 novel The Island of Doctor Moreau by H. G. Wells. Author Wells was allegedly unaware that this unauthorized version of his novel existed.\r\n Thought at one time to have been lost, a print has turned up at the Bundesarchiv in Berlin, Germany. The film was only screened in the US for the first time at a \"Monster Bash\" convention in 2014. Comments from the attendees included the fact that the film was somewhat illogical, and had more emphasis on comedy and romance than horror, but that it offered \"memorable glimpses of human-animal hybrids\"."
