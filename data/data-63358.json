    "overview": "Hasmukh Gandhi has a simple philosophy: enjoy and let enjoy. But his stress-free life is interrupted when his daughter, Tanisha comes home with her boyfriend, Montu. While everyone in the Gandhi family has fallen for Montu's charm, Hasmukh sees him for the trickster he is. Not wanting his daughter to be entrapped, Hasmukh has found the perfect boy for her; one who is not only trustworthy, but also someone he knows will take care of her. The trouble is no one approves of his choice."
