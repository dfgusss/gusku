    "overview": "In Spain during civil war, a seminarian, Teo, is assigned to a small, remote fortress on the top of the mountain. Teo has to share a tiny place with Silverio who is already stationed there. They argue with each other over all aspects, including their personality, values and way of living. As time passes they come to understand each other and strike the subtle balance of everyday lives together. But the balance starts to shake when Solska, a wounded militia woman, comes and lives with them."
