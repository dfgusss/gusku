    "overview": "\"What is the meaning of life?\". I posed this question almost daily a year ago, so I decided to get to the bottom of the mystery. I wanted to explore the world by my own power - on a bicycle. Untrained, I set off in June 2013 with over 55 kg of luggage and a video camera. 18,000 kilometers through a total of 22 countries with the goal of fulfilling a dream: the dream of absolute freedom and the discovery of our globe. Now experience together with me a really great adventure - a documentary that is not a script, but life itself. A unique challenge - with nature as an ally and the world as... opponent."
