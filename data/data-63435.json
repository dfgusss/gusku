    "overview": "The film tells the dramatic story of two brothers, professional MMA athletes. This is a picture about duty and life values shown through the prism of the lives of brothers and their father – strong and proud people, a film about family, about the insults that we carry for decades, about the pain that we sometimes thoughtlessly inflict, and about forgiveness, which should always have a place in our hearts."
