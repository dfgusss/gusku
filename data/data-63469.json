There, Tina meets with Vijay Chouhan (Zayed Khan), and both fall in love. Then Tina finds out that her Uncle Tony has been killed in an accident. She is given his belongings, and is thereafter thrust into a nightmare by a gang of people who will not stop at anything to get what Tony has left for Tina. She turns to Vijay for help, only to find out that he is Prakash Yogi, the brother of a criminal who belonged to the same gang as Tony, who were successful in robbing an armoured vehicle in India, three years ago. The only person who can now help Tina is in the Indian Embassy, Deepak Chopra, but he too has an ulterior motive."
