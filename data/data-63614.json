Also appearing is a menagerie of Kaufman's collection of human oddities, including the infamous Tony Clifton, The Love Family (a sub-Partridge Family singing group who do a bang-up version of \"The Age of Aquarius\" complete with synchronized dance movements), Grant Bowman the \"Happy New Year Man\" (straight from Times Square, where Andy found him), \"cowgirl\" Eleanor Cody Gould and an uncredited, surprise big name guest as Andy’s grandmother. Bob Zmuda appears as Andy's referee, and at the end of the show, Andy takes the entire audience out for milk and cookies."
