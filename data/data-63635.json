    "overview": "Princess Valerie is a bit spoiled and bossy. So when she sniffs the magic rose of the devil's grandmother, whom she had previously offended, she loses her voice. And this causes real hell for Valerie, because the lady-in-waiting pretends to be her spokesperson and passes off everything she herself wishes as the princess's opinions. On her advice, the king organizes a ball, to which the princess is to wear an ugly green dress that does not suit her, and to get Albino of the Capes, whom the lady-in-waiting has chosen for her, as her groom. When Valerie gets rid of her nasty nature and finds out who really loves her, the rose will certainly help to undo what she has done."
