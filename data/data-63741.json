    "overview": "Eddie is no longer living with his wife and their son Noam. One night, he gets mugged and badly injured, and consequently becomes a hero to his son and the victim of a vicious crime to his wife. But when Ahmed, the perfect scapegoat for the attack, is charged, the gravitas of his accusation sucks Eddie into an infernal spiral of self-doubt and lies, marking the start of a dangerous freefall."
