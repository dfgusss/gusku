    "overview": "DL2 reflects the influence of the American Bauhaus movement in Chicago introduced by Lazlo Moholy-Nagy during the late 30s/early 40s. The fim was made by shocking ten-foot strips of unprocessed black and white film into tanks of cold water, fixer, hot water, developer and then repeating the process. Lawrence Janiak arranged them into what he called \"interesting sequences,\" optically printed through various pieces of color gels, carefully labeling each color and repeating them at various speeds."
