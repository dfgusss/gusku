    "overview": "“The three parts developed over a year period of intense study during the mid-1970s. It sort of began and ended my dependency on “high-tech” equipment to make films and led me through the equally intensive parameters of what motion picture film could reproduce on a visceral, detail oriented level.  In contrast to the high end 2K digital technology used to restore ‘Manhatta’ and 'Ballet Mechanique', I learned filmmaking decades earlier on a 35mm Oxberry beam-splitter, multi-head, aerial-image bi-pac optical printer. A dinosaur by today’s standards and all hand operated prior to the advent of computer-assists, this machine was precise and exact to the frame. ’S&J: Pt. 3' took 26 hours to shoot straight thru without one mistake.”  —Bruce Posner"
