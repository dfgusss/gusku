    "overview": "A man dies of cancer—and then wakes up, decades in the future, because his body was cryogenically preserved. Now he’s not only cured of cancer, but also rejuvenated. And his wife is also alive again, restored to health and youth by miraculous future technology. It’s a post-scarcity future, in which the biggest problem is learning how to start over when everything is new and different."
