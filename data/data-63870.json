    "overview": "In order to renovate the damaged church on the border between the hostile villages of Oberriesling and Unterriesling, the residents set off together in a coach to faraway Hamburg under the leadership of the Häberles and Rossbauers. There, they want to win a brass band competition with a highly lucrative prize. Unfortunately, Pastor Schäuble has drunk away all the donations. There are already plenty of arguments on the way north and the Hamburg mentality is not compatible with the Swabian one."
