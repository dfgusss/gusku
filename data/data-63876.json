    "overview": "Despite what he says, Adam is not \"fine\". The summer before freshman year should be a time full of possibilities, but Adam struggles with family tragedy, everyday teenage growing pains, and the very real threat of high school hazing. Fortunately, Adam finds allies (some likely, some unlikely) who help him repair his heartache as well as his ailing relationship with his father. Set in a small, Southern California beach town, Adam discovers the inner strength one can find with the support of a community. His story is proof of the notion that with the help of family and friends, you can always find your way back home."
