    "overview": "Each morning, Bartabas works with his favorite horse, Caravage. They share a silent conversation in which they guide each other. Will they reach a certain perfection which will allow them to perform before the public ? The filmmaker has been given access to witness this intimate relationship: health hiccups, sessions that don't work out and the questioning they lead to, perfecting the act, tasting the joy of a flawless performance. As the film goes by, a trio comes to life, where hearts beat as one. The spectator will perhaps make the trio a quartet."
