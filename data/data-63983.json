    "overview": "The old mansion in Plaka, inherited by three cousins, becomes the stone of the scandal, as each of them thinks to use it differently. Achilleas wants to turn it into a nightclub, where he will present his dance program, while Hippocrates lives in it and rents the basement to the girl he loves, Despina. Things are complicated by the arrival from abroad of the third heiress, Kaiti, who will blow their minds."
