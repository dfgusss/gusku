    "overview": "In 2008 Patricio Guzmán carried out a survey to find out the \"state of historical memory\" in Santiago. To do this, it brings together a small number of historians, psychologists, economists, engineers, lawyers and other members of the Chilean elite. It is a documentary in the form of a report that directly shows the opinions of each participant (including Juan Emilio Cheyre, former commander-in-chief of the armed forces). As expected, the result is controversial."
