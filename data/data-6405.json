    "overview": "While recovering in a hospital, war hero Jefferson Jones grows familiar with the \"Diary of a Housewife\" column written by Elizabeth Lane. Jeff's nurse arranges with Elizabeth's publisher, Alexander Yardley, for Jeff to spend the holiday at Elizabeth's bucolic Connecticut farm with her husband and child. But the column is a sham, so Elizabeth and her editor, Dudley Beecham, in fear of losing their jobs, hasten to set up the single, childless and entirely  nondomestic Elizabeth on a country farm."
