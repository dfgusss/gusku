    "overview": "There are a lot of strange and weird goings on in the little village of Deddington. For centuries a pack of werewolves has resided in the sleepy town, but when local girl Charlotte meets a particularly gruesome death, the town is descended upon by reporters, crazy detectives and lunatic hunters desperate to get their story, solve the crime and kill the beasts. But these wolves are smart… very smart."
