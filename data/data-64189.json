    "overview": "Mister Sim is of no concern whatsoever. At least, this is what he thinks about himself. His wife has left him, his job has left him, and when goes to see his father in a remote part of Italy, not even Dad has the time to have lunch with him. He then receives an unexpected offer: to travel through France selling toothbrushes that will \"revolutionize oral-dental hygiene.\" He takes advantage of the job to catch up with people from his childhood, to meet the first big love of his life, along with his daughter, and to make amazing discoveries and, in so doing, rediscover himself."
