    "overview": "The friendship, laughter and shared love between two brothers is tested when a 14-year-old boy is confronted with the complexities of a simple relationship.  Gaurav finds out that his elder brother Mihir is gay. He is unable to accept this as he looks up to Mihir, a high-school jock whom every girl fancies. Adding to his woes, the girl he fancies 'friend-zones' him.  'How to fix your gay kid' is what their mother types into internet search when Mihir reveals his sexual orientation and wishes to come out of the closet."
