    "overview": "Isabelle and Maxime are a pair of lighthearted lovers -- that is, until Isabelle gets the itch for motherhood. When she confesses her desire for a child, Maxime panics. As a cartoonist by trade he is far from financially stable, so he outright rejects the idea of parenthood. What follows is a roller-coaster romance full of recriminations and reconciliations, until Maxime must ultimately decide whether his fear of becoming a parent is a reason to leave."
