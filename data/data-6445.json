    "overview": "Samuel is 30. Formerly a confirmed bachelor, he has been living with Tina – a photographer – for the past year but he gets scared when it’s time to commit. So he gives himself 24 hours to decide whether or not to break up with the woman he loves, convinced she will leave him sooner or later. By his side, Samuel can count on Jorge and Mounir, his usual confidants."
