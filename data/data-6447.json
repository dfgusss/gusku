    "overview": "Sami and Patrick are long-time friends. Sami is a hypochondriac. One day, following a misunderstanding at the hospital, Sami thinks he has an incurable neurological disease. He decides to live his last moments to the fullest and goes to India to be treated by a great local \"doctor\". In the meantime, his friend Patrick, who has been accompanying and supporting him without knowing that this illness is in fact fictitious, finds himself without a wife or job. The initial situation seems to be reversed; Patrick is out of luck and Sami seems less and less ill."
