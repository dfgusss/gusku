    "overview": "Fermin and Julio are two married men whose wives, Justina and Mireya, are political leaders. While Justine is part of a conservative party, Mireya leads one that is feminist. Their husbands have become something completely different to what is generally expected in that is it they who are responsible for caring for their children, cleaning the house, etc...though of course they also get into trouble with women. Fermin and Julio are regulars at a whorehouse who runs Encarna, but it's unusual in that in addition to its main function, it also servers as a nursery."
