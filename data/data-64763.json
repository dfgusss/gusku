    "overview": "A group of high school seniors want to relieve the stress of their upcoming exams. With a month to go before the exam, they decide to do one last crazy thing. Taking advantage of the fact that no one is around in the evening, they decide to drink and party in the teachers' lounge at school. The friends manage to sneak into the school unnoticed and start the party. They drink beer, dance, and laugh. One of the group's suggestions changes the course of the night: to summon the spirit of Kevser, a young girl who committed suicide at their school years ago. Though it initially seems like a fun activity, by the time they realize what this spirit-summoning session has unleashed, it's already too late. Kevser's spirit has returned as Ümmü Sıbyan. According to popular belief, this malevolent spirit, once summoned, preys on women who are expecting children, darkening their lives because she herself could not have children."
