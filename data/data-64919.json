    "overview": "We follow the story of Yunus, who lives in one of the Anatolian villages ravaged by war and violence, and his transformation into Yunus Emre, a figure of global significance whose thoughts and poems blend love and passion. His great regret at choosing to console himself with wheat will drive him to seek answers. This quest will be so profound that he will set out on the road, bidding farewell to everyone he loves, especially his beloved Balım Kız. On his journey to attain the greatest love of all, Divine Love, he will seek guidance from all the saints of Anatolia, unaware that what he seeks is already within him."
