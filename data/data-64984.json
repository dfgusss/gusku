    "overview": "A Slovenian mother takes her addicted and self-destructive daughter with her to a remote Italian village. Isolation as attempted salvation. Inspired by Proust, Skafar turns this theme into a gentle and beautiful film, a poem about two souls in which the unutterable slowly comes to the surface."
