    "overview": "An aspiring animation creator's dreams start coming true when she is met with a charismatic young boy.  Jo and the Boy is not exactly a children's movie, but more of a Hollywood-style inspirational film set in the backdrop of an unspecified cold hill town and centered on a child enamored by cartoon characters. In fact, the only connect with Indian reality is that the characters speak Malayalam."
