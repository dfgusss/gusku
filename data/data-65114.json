    "overview": "After his mother unexpectedly dies, 17-year-old Ethan discovers he is the owner of his mother's horse - a horse he never even knew existed. He travels cross country to live with his grandparents and investigate the mystery. His grandmother is supportive but his angry grandfather Otto doesn't seem to want him around. Next door live three children who are taking riding lessons at the same farm where his mother's horse is boarded. Their lives intersect as Ethan deals with his grief over his mother's death and the children deal with a neighborhood bully whose father works at the horse farm. The journey for Ethan, Otto, the three children, the bully and her father all revolve around a gentle and faithful horse called Bear who deeply touches all their lives. This is a delightful redemption-themed family movie that will appeal to children, teens, horse-lovers and people of all ages."
