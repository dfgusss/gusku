Now married to her boyfriend’s rival, Dr. Mitch Kayne, and a mother to a 5-year-old son, she has an established life she remembers nothing about.  Everyone around her denies that her boyfriend Neil ever existed. As Lily begins to doubt her own sanity, memories of Neil resurface, causing her to encounter unexplainable incidents. While desperately searching for the truth of her past life, she questions her entire existence; but in the end, she discovers the meaning of true love."
