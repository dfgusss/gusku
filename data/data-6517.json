    "overview": "Natural changes have the clans moving. Iza, medicine woman of the \"Clan of the Cave Bear\" finds little Ayla from the \"others\"' clan - tradition would have the clan kill Ayla immediately, but Iza insists on keeping her. When the little one finds a most needed new cave, she's allowed to stay - and thrive."
