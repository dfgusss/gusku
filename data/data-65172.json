Now his adult daughter is set on visiting Sarajevo (Zlatan’s hometown) together with him in order to walk the streets of his youth and hear his story. Despite initial unwillingness, Zlatan lets himself be persuaded and the reunion with the home country brings both absurd surprises and secrets from the past."
