    "overview": "As George Antheil's avant-garde composition \"Ballet Mecanique (1952 revision)\" plays, a dizzying array of abstract paintings are captured in close-up, spun around, and rapidly edited together. Grotesque and frightening creatures start to emerge through the flickering shapes and patterns."
