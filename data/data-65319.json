    "overview": "Odysseus, a typical bourgeois, married and father of two, is working in the accounting department of a large company when he is suddenly fired, leaving him stranded. Now unemployed, with severance pay in his pocket, he wanders aimlessly around summer Athens. In his wanderings he meets a girl who represents for him the lost youth. He follows her everywhere, but every now and then he loses sight of her and worries. It's a wander from Athens to Hydra, and yet it's full of surprises, funny moments, but also suspense."
