With their 30th birthdays looming, they set out on a mission to become famous in the 24/7, celebrity-obsessed world. Through it all, our disheartened duo inadvertently become key witnesses in a high profile crime that sets the news cycle on fire, making them household names... but only if they can survive the infamy and worldwide shame."
