    "overview": "In search of a miracle, an American woman embarks on a journey to the Peruvian Amazon and finds hope in a community, through rituals involving an ancient psychedelic plant known as ayahuasca. With her perception forever altered, she forges a bond with a young indigenous shaman undergoing a crisis of his own, and a motley crew of psychonauts seeking transcendence, companionship, and the meaning of life and death."
