    "overview": "Whether he’s singing an ode to “queer tattoos,” telling his potential paramour all the things he won’t be doing for her (he ain’t fightin’ no Lion), or lamenting his new vegan lifestyle (“Tofurkey? Tof**k yourself- I want some meat”), Stephen Lynch will always consider himself “a musician trapped in the body of a comedian.” His unique blend of musical based comedy has earned him fiercely loyal fans around the world who live to experience his sold-out live shows, five best-selling CDs, his RIAA-certified Gold DVD and his 2 top-rated Comedy Central Specials. You may also recognize him from his Tony-nominated role starring in The Wedding Singer on Broadway.  Hello Kalamazoo is his first special in over 10 years and was recorded at the end of his Lion tour."
