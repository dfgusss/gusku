    "overview": "Coach Banks (Robert Townsend) is used to calling all the shots for his championship high school basketball team and in his own love life. But that’s about to change when he meets, Talisa McCoy (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), the mother of a star player, new to Jackson high. She’s a beautiful, strong-willed single mom, with her own ideas on a winning team…and the perfect man. Now, this coach will have to learn a few new plays if he’s going to stay in the game."
