    "overview": "A single woman struggles to rebuild her life in Brooklyn after spending 10 years abroad as the unrecognized muse to a famous filmmaker. Wallabout is an intimate first-person account of an overeducated and underemployed outsider who navigates an often hypocritical and corrupt society. It's an urban meditation on artistic perseverance and the eternal search for family."
