In \"The Earth,\" Ana is a young and idealistic woman on the verge of adulthood when her first relationship with a clerk shatters her dreams of a romantic life. In \"The Air,\" Ana is a rebellious, easy-living type among some beach bums whose sexual leanings tend to tip the scale at active promiscuity. In \"The Cloud,\" Ana only exists in the imagination of an introverted man, who dreams of his ideal woman."
