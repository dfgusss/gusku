    "overview": "A hard-hitting yet humorous exposé on the breathtaking abuses of power in higher education, Evan Maloney's \"Indoctrinate U\" Shows what you won't see in the glossy marketing brochures of American colleges and universities. When unsuspecting students and professors run afoul of the campus thought police, the result would make for a great comic farce–if real careers weren't at stake."
