    "overview": "Hilariously bogus \"documentary on the film capital of the world\" inspired by the Italian mondo movie genre. A look at adult book stores, grindhouses, strip joints, \"Figure Model Photography Studios\" and midnight pool parties. This is more cynical sexploitation from director Lee Frost and producer Bob Cresse, the loveable hucksters."
