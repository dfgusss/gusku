    "overview": "A group of friends, including Mukhin, a furniture factory worker, with his wife and son, go out on a day off. There are four drunk young men in the neighborhood. They pester vacationers and start a fight. They are rebuffed only by Mukhin. Protecting his wife and child, he hit the leader of a hooligan gang. Death was instantaneous. The rowdies turn out to be locals. They pretend to be victims, blaming the \"tourists\" from the city."
