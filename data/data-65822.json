A writer, poet and meditation master, Khyentse Rinpoche was an inspiration to all who encountered him. His many students throughout the world included the Dalai Lama.

Along with rare photographs of Tibet, Bhutan and Nepal, this film features interviews with the Dalai Lama.  Director Matthieu Ricard -- French photographer, Buddhist monk and bestselling author -- travelled with Khyentse Rinpoche for over 14 years."
