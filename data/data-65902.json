    "overview": "A feature-length documentary to show why Britain should vote to LEAVE the EU - and would thrive outside of it.  Brexit: The Movie spells out the danger of staying part of the EU. Is it safe to give a remote government beyond our control the power to make laws? Is it safe to tie ourselves to countries which are close to financial ruin, drifting towards scary political extremism, and suffering long-term, self-inflicted economic decline?"
