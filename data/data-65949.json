    "overview": "Eun-hee is an actress who also plays in her real life. One day, she meets three different men and changes her own character each time she dates them, just like taking a role in the play. One is clever and polite, another is boyish and honest, and the last seems elegant and mature. Though each of her performances full of lies seems going smoothly, everything is about to be messed up at the end."
