    "overview": "In Dan Soder's first hour-long special, he reveals the creepiest thing about his grandmother, admits that his recent breakup was his fault and remembers the hardest thing about being raised by a single mom. Throughout his special, Soder is so laid-back and charming that you'll be grateful he wasn't actually possessed by the devil that one time."
