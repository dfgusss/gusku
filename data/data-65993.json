    "overview": "Scott, a gifted young snowboarder, has one dream: to be number one. He wants to do what no one has ever succeeded in doing: to climb Mount Everest and ride the world's purest, steepest, and most dangerous descent. Once in Chamonix, the riders' Mecca, he crosses paths with Pierrick, a former champion turned mountain guide. Scott knows that this is the encounter that could take him to the top."
