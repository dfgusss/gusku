    "overview": "Sinbad, a young and easygoing pirate, is not very adept at pirating: he and his crew have not been able to capture a single ship in a year. But fate finally smiles at Sinbad: old Antioch shows him an ancient map and persuades him to set sail for Skeleton Island to seek buried treasure."
