    "overview": "Manolo is a private detective who specializes in adultery cases. Commissioned by one of the victims, he takes photos and videos of adulterous couples in fraganti. He often attempts double-schemes, however, by sending the evidence to the other victim, in an attempt to exploit and benefit from both parts."
