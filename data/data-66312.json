This inspirational segment of the film depicts the unique, diverse and folklore ways that Welles is honored throughout the United States including in art, sports and song.  Even President Barack Obama pays homage to this young man in the film.  Our uplifting ending culminates in the revelation of a secret about Welles that can only be described as \"perfect\"."
