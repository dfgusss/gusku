    "overview": "Stand-up veteran Deon Cole dazzles the crowd with his sharp jokes and easy charm in his first hour-long special. He pontificates on subjects ranging from the endless uses for plastic bags to how he knows he's aging to why we'll never have another black president. Cole's observations about race, society, and everyday life are often absurd and always intelligent."
