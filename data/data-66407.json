    "overview": "An American dream in Finland - a brand new car and a monthly income of 150,000 Euros. The worst recession period of Finnish history is over but unemployment is decreasing slowly. The spectacular financial growth gained by the Finnish Nokia doesn't reach everyone. Viljo and Kaisu Mikkonen together with 30,000 other Finnish small entrepreneurs lost everything they owned during the downswing, and return to working-life is not easy."
