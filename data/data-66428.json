    "overview": "A Blanc-Biehn production centered around the idea of a governmentally designed drug created to help correct or strategically alter perceptions gathered during times of trauma or stress. Slated as being a substance that may help solve issues with everything from racial tensions, PTSD and geopolitic battles, first a focused study is needed to see how people respond to treatment and what dosages might be needed. Four couples are chosen to test this drug, and soon find their memories and sanity challenged."
