Nayyef, a translator for the U.S. military, and Btoo, a soldier in the Iraqi army, face persecution, and possibly death, if they stay in their homeland. After obtaining a visa, Nayyef leaves his love behind, settling in Seattle with a determination to one day reunite with Btoo in a place where they can express their love freely and without fear."
