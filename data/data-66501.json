    "overview": "An over-the-top homage to the shot-on-video, gore-soaked classics of yesteryear. A group of hyper-sexed, ready-to-bleed teen stereotypes decide to spend the night camping out in a haunted house on Halloween — and are sliced and diced one by one at the hands of a mysterious killer, but not before they get in plenty gratuitous nudity, unprotected sex and heavy drinking."
