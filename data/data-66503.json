    "overview": "It’s like almost all is lost.  Yet still they are here – abandoned bungalows, an artificial lake, dirty  plastic bottles, lost donkeys and stray dogs, draining pipes running over  fields of salt, deserted factories, statues of revolutionaries, concrete  playgrounds covered with weeds, rotten fruit, folded T-shirts, pop songs,  decades of forgetting, a single room with a blue tent inside.  And it felt like a kiss."
