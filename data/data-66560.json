    "overview": "The film follows the aftermath of an unfortunate incident at the inauguration of a public toilet located in the middle of the Egyptian desert. Inspired by Anton Chekhov's short story \"The Death Of A Government Clerk,\" director El Zohairy offers us a story about fear in a milieu where uniformity and hierarchy reigns, in which the poses and gestures of the actors express a lot more than their words."
