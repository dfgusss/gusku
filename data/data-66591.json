    "overview": "The Robin Hood from the movie The Trapalhões and his pack ruin the plans of a farmer named João Climério. He wanted to take the lands of his deceased brother and leave his niece Catherine with nothing. During a showdown, Robin Hood is injured and needs to be replaced at the helm of the group. And then the funny confusions begin! As a substitute is chosen Zé Grilo, a modest and at the same time confused pawn, who in the end manages to unmask Climero and save the beautiful Catherine for which he has a passion. In this mission it is aided by the companion Willie and also by a magic wand and a protective pen, provided by an Indian sorcerer."
