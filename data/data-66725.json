A Man and Two Women: Anne, a young woman, a slightly bohemian painter: \"in love\" with her newborn, she abandons her husband while Isabelle, her best friend, attracted by to him and becomes little by little her rival. Each Other:Fréda finds her brother every morning in the secret of her bedroom,they leave themselves and incestuous effective becomes the only possible relationship for both. Our Friend Judith: Judith, a cold and warm intellectual, secret and complex - Beautiful, Judith is careful not to show it, she knows interment and that is enough. Intelligent, she does not bend to the rules of fashion nor seduction."
