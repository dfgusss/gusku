    "overview": "A random act of theft has put Tom Hammond's life into a tailspin. Stolen from his bookshop is Tom's most treasured possession, a photograph of him with his son Luke...their last moment of shared happiness. The Last Photograph is set between London in 2002, and a dark night in 1988 when Pan Am 103 was blown out of the sky over Lockerbie."
