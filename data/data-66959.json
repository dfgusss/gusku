    "overview": "A little known episode from the life of Stalinist security police office Julia Brystiger. Her nickname Bloody Luna was a reference  to her incredibly brutal methods of interrogation. In the early 1960s, she appears in a centre for the blind on the outskirts of  Warsaw, a place often visited by Cardinal Wyszyński, whose imprisonment in 1953-1956 Brystiger supervised personally. During a difficult and heated discussion with the cardinal, Brystiger denounces the communist ideology and begs for forgiveness for her crimes and for guidance in her search for God."
