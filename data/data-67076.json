    "overview": "Killing Reagan explores the events surrounding the assassination attempt on president Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. Based on the best-selling book, the film begins in the final months leading up to the 1980 presidential election, and explores the challenges Reagan faced to define himself as a leader. Meanwhile, an aimless and deranged Hinckley is unraveling, leading to the fateful day in March 1981 when these disparate figures collided."
