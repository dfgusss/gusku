    "overview": "The boy didn't want to do anything except watch cartoons and play games. He didn't tidy up his toys, didn't help his grandmother around the house, and dreamed of going to a country where no one would make him do anything. His wish came true — he ended up in the country of Nehochukhia, with all kinds of entertainment and service robots."
