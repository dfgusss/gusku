    "overview": "A man wakes up one morning with an annoying ringing sound in his ears. A note on the fridge says: \"Your friend Luigi has died. P.S. I took the car\". The problem is that he does not even remember who this guy Luigi is. This is just the beginning of a tragicomic day during which he will be plunged into the folly of the world. One of those days that changes your life forever."
