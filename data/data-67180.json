She soon embarks on a bloody quest for revenge, hunting down her ex-colleagues of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad before confronting Bill himself. Quentin Tarantino’s complete Kill Bill, a combination of Volumes 1 and 2, previously deleted scenes, alternate takes, a full-color remaster of the Crazy 88 fight, a 7-minute anime sequence by Production I.G., and a built-in intermission."
