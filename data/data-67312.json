    "overview": "The action takes place in the 14th century, in times of the reconquest, in the Kingdom of Valencia. Father Vicente is a chaste monk who fights against all kinds of vices and sins, against superstition and against the beliefs of Muslims and Jews. Carles Mira's first feature film was inspired by the great amount of popular imagery that has provoked the supposed miracles of Saint Vicente Ferrer. The repertoire includes anecdotes of grotesque and eschatological character with an eminently esperpento touch."
