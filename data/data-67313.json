    "overview": "An intimate portrait of a group of very different suicide bombers working for Al Qaeda in Syria. From the Saudi who loves singing and fried chicken, to a 26-year-old white British convert who worries a lot about his new wife, this remarkable film embeds with an unlikely bunch of \"martyrdom seekers\", each waiting for their turn to go on a final mission, known by Jihadis as 'Dugma'."
