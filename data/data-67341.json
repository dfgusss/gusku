    "overview": "They're losers, but nice ones. Every day they sit at Yeri's bar, smitten by the young Chinese-Korean woman. Yeri doesn't have a preference. To her, they are equally sweet: Jongbin, a milk-drinking epileptic, Ikjune, a former petty criminal, and the introverted Jungbum, who fled from North Korea."
