    "overview": "Marianne, 44, has been living with the lawyer Gustaf in a conventional sexless marriage for way too long. She wants a separation, but Gustav settles for a trial separation. As Marianne indulges in being newly single, Gustaf is perplexed by the sudden turn of events and in his confusion makes a completely irrational career change: he quits his job to start writing poetry. Meanwhile, Marianne meets the artist Rodolfo, the complete opposite of Gustaf; intriguing, emotional, impulsive. And horny."
