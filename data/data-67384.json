    "overview": "Hélène and Paul, early 30s and long-term singles, have been living in a two-person flat for years. Currently, graphic designer Paul wants to escape the digital constraints of his time and has acquired an age-old phone on which only \"real\" friends can reach him. One evening Paul gets from a friend at a party, his future predicted: Soon he will meet the love of his life, but also commit a murder. A short time later, when he meets the stunning Camille and falls in love with her, he begins to doubt with all luck. Could the prophecy really be true?"
