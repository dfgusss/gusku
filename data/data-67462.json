    "overview": "A fictitious country in South America: the military has taken power in the state and rules with an iron hand. Anyone who expresses criticism of the system is imprisoned. In a rebellious small town, however, the citizens show solidarity with the numerous political prisoners - until all the town's inhabitants are arrested. Now \"peace reigns in the land\" again."
