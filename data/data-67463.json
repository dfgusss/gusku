    "overview": "An adaptation of Dorota Masłowska's play. The film satirically portrays post-Communist Polish society through three generations of women, an ailing grandmother, her daughter Halina, and granddaughter “Little Metal Girl”, crammed into a shabby Warsaw flat, their lives peppered with absurd pop-culture quips, ad slogans, tabloids, and national stereotypes. Their cramped world is populated by quirky neighbors, a leaflet-dropping Bożena, an eccentric film director, two actors, a TV presenter, and Edyta, who crusades for the poor."
