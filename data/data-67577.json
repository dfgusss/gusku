    "overview": "Svetlana Vasilievna is a young, energetic woman who often changes jobs, accustomed to achieving the goals that she has set for herself in life. Her next desire is to marry a \"creative, intelligent\" person.\r\n After a lengthy search, she chose an elderly, but well-mannered, intelligent official Vladimir Dmitrievich Lobanov. Svetlana believes that with the help of connections and sober calculation, you can achieve everything: well-being, respectability, even personal happiness. She does not notice that the fulfillment of her desires does not at all make the person close to her happy. The payback turns out to be unexpected and terrible."
