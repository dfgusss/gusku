He believes he is a Shaolin monk, dressing and behaving just like his cinematic references. However, he is the subject of mocking jokes in his hometown, Quixadá, in the backlands of Ceará. His days of peace will end when retired MMA fighter Toni Tora Pleura announces a \"tour\" of challenges to bullies in several cities in the interior of Ceará, including Quixadá."
