She is then forced to reconnect with her ex-boyfriend, cosmetic surgeon Max Labarador. Much to Andi’s shock, Max is already in a three-year live-in relationship with pediatric oncologist Christian Pilar. With nowhere else to go and left with no other options, she agrees to live with the couple – both parties agreeing into a deal that will change the course of their lives and hearts."
