    "overview": "In late 2015, \"Bright Ideas\" magazine and its publisher, the innovative crowdfunding and distribution platform Seed &amp; Spark, commissioned directing duo the Zellner Bros. (KUMIKO, THE TREASURE HUNTER) to make a short piece in response to a Criterion Collection release that they considered inspiring. The brothers chose Louis Malle's wild, hallucinogenic BLACK MOON (1975), itself a tripped-out reimagining of \"Alice in Wonderland.\" Shot in the woods near their Austin homes, BLACK SOMETHING captures Malle's blending of idyllic pastoral imagery with nightmarish fantasy, distilling it into a skin-crawlingly unsettling three-minute short."
