    "overview": "When the atheistic ranting of Irish-American author James Mulcahy upsets the inhabitants of the Irish village to which he has retired, a mob threatens him. But moments after he has dared God to strike him dead, a stranger appears and does so. The man, dubbed \"Johnny Nobody\" by the press, claims no knowledge of Mulcahy or even of himself.

And then, the good father learns a little more about Johnny Nobody..."
