If they succeed, Denmark will be only the fourth nation in history to launch people beyond the Earth's atmosphere. Against their families odd's and technical challenges they build the cheapest rocket for the costs of a small car. They attract a group of space-flight enthusiasts from around the world who support them with great excitement.
