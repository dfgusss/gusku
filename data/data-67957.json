    "overview": "In the fairy tale comedy, a strange princess is born. She can be wound up like a mechanical toy. At first glance, this seems like a certain advantage, because if such a child is naughty, the parents simply won't wind them up. But when adolescence arrives and with it first love, it's not so simple. After all, Princess Marenka also had quite a few problems with her \"peculiarity\"."
