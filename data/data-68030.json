    "overview": "Under the auspicious name \"Magical Mystery\" the Berlin techno label BummBumm Records wants to go on a rave tour. Karl Schmidt aka Charly himself was once an aspiring artist on the scene, until he retired after a nervous breakdown five years ago. Since then he lives in a supervised withdrawal WG in Hamburg. Now, as a driver and custodian for the party-loving DJs and their producers, he becomes part of \"Magical Mystery\", trying to lead a self-determined life after years of patronizing and well-intentioned advice."
