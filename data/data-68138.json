    "overview": "Riley Thomas is sent by her profit-obsessed boss to shut down one of the company’s holdings, a small outerwear company in Vermont, for missing profit targets. Riley finds that the company is the lifeblood of a town and, instead of closing down the iconic firm, she unexpectedly falls in love and learns valuable lessons beyond the bottom line."
