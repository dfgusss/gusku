    "overview": "Memory is the glue that binds our mental lives. But how does it work? Neuroscientists using cutting-edge techniques are exploring the precise molecular mechanisms of memory. By studying a range of individuals ranging-from an 11-year-old whiz-kid, Jake Hausler, who remembers every detail of his life to a woman who had memories implanted-scientists have uncovered a provocative idea."
