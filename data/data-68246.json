    "overview": "Ian Harvie is not quite the kind of man you might think. He's redefining what it means to be a dude through a fresh perspective on sex/sexuality with some seriously funny and new kinds of dick jokes. Proving that laughter cuts across all identities and ultimately unites us all. Oh and, Ian is the world's first trans man comedian with a stand up comedy special."
