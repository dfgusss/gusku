    "overview": "Since the ban on use of animals in circus shows, the Great Sumatra Circus faces a major financial crisis. Baron, who owns the circus, accepts unseemly proposals from the mayor to hold cattle auctions, rallies and other alternative events at the circus. Unhappy with the news, circus artists come together to plan a new show and re-attract the audience, led by Didi, Dedé and Karina."
