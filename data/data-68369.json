    "overview": "It is morning, April 10, 2010. A nice, calm, spring day is coming. Millions of Polish families are still asleep when, in dozens of houses and apartments, nearly a hundred people are getting ready to travel by the safest means of transportation - the presidential plane. The destination: Smolensk. However, as the day draws to a close, unimaginable sadness and pain will invade these dozens of homes and apartments. Feelings that will be shared by the entire nation."
