    "overview": "The screen version of the Saltykov-Shchedrin tale about how two complacent generals miraculously found themselves on an uninhabited island. How a peasant was courting the generals, feeding and dressing them, content himself with crumbs from their table. They only slightly thanked him, but in the end they gave him only glass of vodka and a penny of silver."
