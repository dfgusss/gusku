    "overview": "In Zakopane - though really anywhere in the universe - an alien civilization lands seeking help with an intimate problem and awaits their contact, Yrek. When a nosy innkeeper alerts the press upon learning their mission, journalists descend and inadvertently entangle local Polish and Czech gangsters and their tailing agents in a cosmic game of cat-and-mouse, threatening to turn the quiet mountain retreat into the scene of an interplanetary showdown."
