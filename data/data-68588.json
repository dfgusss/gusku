    "overview": "Vacation on a container ship! Aspiring journalist Eva, who isn't exactly trusted due to her weak nerves, wants to use this unusual Far East voyage to finally show what she's made of. During the monotonous weeks on the high seas, Eva plans 'covert investigations' to land a hot story about ship hijackings and pirates in the South China Sea. Finally, she has the chance to be recognized as a serious journalist, and Eva isn't about to miss it! Highly motivated, she boards the 'Liberty' in Bangkok and begins to grill the ship's crew and captain—without realizing that she's actually hit the jackpot with this freighter! On the high seas, the ship is hijacked, and the crew and their valuable cargo fall into the hands of a band of armed pirates."
