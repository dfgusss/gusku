    "overview": "This film is a documentary composition of new jazz, New York as the city that generates it, and the musicians playing it.  The thoughts of the saxophonist Charles Gayle and the bass players William Parker and Peter Kowald from Germany accompany the film. Shot on 16 mm, this film remains one of a kind until today. Some of the recorded musicians have passed away - their spirits live on."
