    "overview": "Sometimes it takes a miracle for the attraction of opposites to work: Fabian Lauber and Janne Jarst are fascinated by each other, but couldn't be more different. The headstrong country doctor is an adrenaline junkie who gets his kicks from wingsuit jumping and fast driving. He obviously only took over his father's practice after his death for his mother's sake. For Janne, a specialist in Chinese medicine, on the other hand, calmness and attentive treatment of her patients are very important."
