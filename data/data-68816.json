    "overview": "They are on their way and Eva is still insecure. Her deep love and devotion for Jaime has led her to accept a special offer: swinging in order to arouse their marriage after fifteen years. Jaime seems doubly confident: a curvy 19-year-old Brazilian is waiting for him, while Eva has to resign herself to an uninspiring and unattractive partner. What looked like a night of playing, liberation and revitalization for this husband and wife becomes a mess inside four walls when Jaime discovers that their partners for the evening are not who they said they were."
