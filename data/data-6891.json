    "overview": "Ron and Melinda may be happily engaged, but Melinda's scheming brother-in-law Todd doesn't like the thought of a new addition to the family business, so he plans to incriminate Ron at the ultimate bachelor bash in Miami Beach. Between Ron's party-hearty friends and Todd's tantalizing temptations, not to mention a sex addicts convention right in their hotel, it's an outrageously sinful celebration that you have to see to believe!"
