An innate desire to travel, to meet people and to do the unexpected has become a calling card of sorts as fans the world over join their community and fall in love with their consistently evolving music. The documentary follows the band and their latest set of collaborators as they travel across uncharted territory, playing the major cities of South Africa with an eclectic mix of musician friends.

The film showcases the band at their most open and collaborative as they relish the excitement of playing to crowds in new cities who've never seen them before.
