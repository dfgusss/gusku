    "overview": "When small town drifter Sammy Barlach drives into Venus Holler in search for his next cold beer and the bunch that'll have him, he gets a lot more than he bargained for, namely food, lodging and the possibility of a better future, thanks to crimson-haired Jamalee and her brother Jason, who dream of hitting the big time. Breaks aren't easy to come by, though, if you live in Venus Holler. Powerless against the forces of corruption and prejudice, the hardest things Sammy has to battle are the demons inside his own head."
