    "overview": "A cartoon portraying Churchill as a Jekyll and Hyde figure. In the vaults of the spooky Bank of England Churchill mixes solutions of democracy, fraternity and liberty to produce a concoction which turns him from the demon Hyde figure to his human Jekyll form. Thus disguised he visits his subjects pretending to be friendly but really only to seize their gold. Eventually he is chased by Nazis who bomb London and destroy him."
