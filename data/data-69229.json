    "overview": "Sean's vicious attack leaves a man unconscious and him stranded in an elevator with five others. In the confines of the lift, love has a chance of blossoming - violence has a chance of erupting - Sean has little chance of escape. With his freedom hanging in the balance can the people who fear him offer him one last chance of redemption?"
