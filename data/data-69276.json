    "overview": "The Legend Of Earl Durand was the story of a young child whose family lived near DuBois, Wyoming and made Earl live in a hut in the wild because they thought he had a contagious disease. When the local Aboriginal people discovered his plight, they took him under their wing so he grew up as a sort of wild man, completely able to live off the land. He was known as the \"Robin Hood\" of the West because he hunted game on Federal land which was very illegal and gave the meat to the poor."
