    "overview": "In recording this scene the position of our camera was an excellent one, and we present to the public a most perfect picture of the train’s arrival. The engine is decorated with crepe to mark the solemnity of this great historical event. As the train stops at the platform great respect for the dead President is shown by the waiting diplomats and reception committee baring their heads and standing respectfully on one side as the mourners leave the train."
