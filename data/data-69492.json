    "overview": "The Tersago family isn't your average family business: clowns by day, thieves by night. They get arrested following a robbery homicide in a villa in Brasschaat, but let off for lack of evidence, except for son Wesley. Wesley's sister Amber decides to finish Wesley's wacky reality movie herself. Father Ronny wants to get out of organized crime and launder the stolen money with the production of a musical. Ronny and his companion Lou get approached by two police inspectors entirely convinced of their involvement with the robbery homicide. The stolen money is rumored to belong to a powerful Russian drug lord. The Tersago's now realize their lives are in danger. An armed man slips into the theater during the premiere of the musical while son Wesley plans an escape from prison."
