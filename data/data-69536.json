    "overview": "NBA TV will feature the primetime special — Allen Iverson: The Answer — during its extensive 2016 Finals coverage on Monday, June 6, at 8 p.m. ET, with the fearless and sometimes misunderstood Iverson looking back at his Hall of Fame playing career and the moments that made him one of the most talked about figures in NBA history.  During the hour-long special, NBA TV’s Steve Smith interviews Iverson about the difficult journey from Hampton, Va., to Georgetown University, his selection as the first overall pick in the 1996 NBA Draft, his close relationship with “The City of Brotherly Love” and carrying the 76ers to The Finals, his unapologetic scoring mentality, the famous “Practice” press conference, regrets about leaving Philadelphia, and his impact on pop culture."
