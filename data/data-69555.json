    "overview": "The Siberian city of Norilsk, above the Arctic Circle, was established here for the nickel and other metal deposits. Built under Stalin by Gulag prisoners—who numbered some 650,000 between 1930 and 1950—today it still constitutes an open-air cage, imprisoned by the glacial landscape, imbued with suffering and history."
