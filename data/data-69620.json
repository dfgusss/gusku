    "overview": "When a demanding and seemingly tactless music teacher from Warsaw is assigned to a special needs educational centre in a remote village, he and his new group of students become increasingly at odds with each other as they struggle to understand and accept each other’s ways. They have but one month to reconcile their differences, and make something meaningful together."
