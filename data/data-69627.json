    "overview": "A young woman detaches herself from her family, as she goes on an ecstatic journey to the birthplaces of her Ukrainian-German-Jewish self. While searching for her brother, she loses herself in the midst of national and religious conflicts, embracing the idea of having no identity at all. Leaving her past behind, she descends into the void of the biblical desert."
