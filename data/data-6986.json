    "overview": "A modern remake of Renoir's classic film. Aix-en-Provence, a spring night. Christian Lespinglet, an over-indebted gallery owner, rescues a homeless man, Boudu, from the waters of a canal who was trying to drown himself. Heroic to his detriment, he brings him home, for a few hours only... The incongruous arrival of Boudu will act like a mad dog in the game of skittles that is Christian's life..."
