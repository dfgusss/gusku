    "overview": "The documentary focuses on how future technology could significantly change the two inevitable features of the human experience: punching the clock and fading away. With advanced automation and artificial intelligence, the utopia of the end of human labor or the dystopia of widespread unemployment could not be a thing of science fiction. Scientists, engineers and academics all come together to share their thoughts on the future."
