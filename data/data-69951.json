    "overview": "Frustrated with the traditional school system, a family in Los Angeles pulls their two children out of one of the highest-rated schools in the area and takes their education into their own hands. In the quest to better their children's lives, they must ovecome long-standing assumptions about education and face the social ramifications of their bold decision. Class Dismissed will challenge viewers to take a fresh look at what it means to be educated in the 21st century and offer up a radical new way of thinking about the process of learning."
