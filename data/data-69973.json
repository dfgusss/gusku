    "overview": "The entire village is obsessed with the championship: the establishment team, led by the mayor and his deputy, expects to win, while for the first time the poorest youths from the local Roma settlement, led by a recently released “golden‐footed” ringleader and joined by the juggling church priest, also enter the competition. Both sides hunger for victory, and when a mysterious millionaire offers to fly the top players to Brazil, the stakes skyrocket. The tournament becomes a fight not just for the title but for the village’s social balance."
