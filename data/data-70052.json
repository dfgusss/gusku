    "overview": "A seemingly traditional journey of a young sheikh in a governmental mosque who moves from leading prayers to becoming a TV celebrity issuing \"fatwas\" that are accepted by millions who have become fans of his as a result of his courage and his attempts to deviate from the usual religious rhetoric in a society heavily influenced by fundamentalism. From Behind the scenes that exposes religion and authority struggle - Mawlana is a movie that defy boundaries."
