    "overview": "Gürkan and Altan have fallen into the hands of Cevat Bakır. Cevat Bakır, who killed Şahin for betraying him in the first film, spares the lives of Şahin’s accomplices, Altan and Gürkan, on the condition that they dispose of Şahin’s body. However, the two buddies mess up this task as well, bringing countless troubles upon themselves, just like in the first film, and manage to get the country’s most psychopathic men on their trail."
