    "overview": "On the trail of Tall Tales, on a tour of an American treasure, on the path of an area once inhabited by people we don’t know, people we’ve never met, on a land complete with gift shops, parking lots, and sky rides, at the foot of a tree that predates and outlasts all of this, we now insert ourselves into a fog of layers."
