    "overview": "Hot Property is an (un)romantic comedy about love, greed and estate agents.  Melody Munro is a corporate spy with a big problem - she’s spending everything she has and a few things she hasn't on her lavish lifestyle. But when she gets caught embezzling money from her company she is fired on the spot. No more car, no more credit cards, she can't even afford Nespresso capsules.  When her (now ex) friend and landlord calls to throw her out of the flat, it is the final blow. She will take no more. Melody vows to defend ‘her’ home at all costs. She uses her spy skills to take on her landlord, a raft of hipster tenants and a psychotic estate agent"
