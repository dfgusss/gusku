    "overview": "Upon helping her friend audition for their all-girls high school's production of Romeo & Juliet, freshman Sun-wha is unexpectedly cast as Juliet. To her surprise Romeo is played by the über-cool and stunning senior Ha-nam, whom all the girls seem to have a crush on. As the two would-be thespians grow closer, Ha-nam takes Sun-wha under her wing in more ways than one. However this sparks the jealousy of the play's director, Su-yeon, whom, it turns out, is more than friends with Ha-nam."
