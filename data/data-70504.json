    "overview": "Kennedy Hansen is a funny, loving child but inexplicably she begins to fall. It takes years for the diagnosis… Juvenile Batten Disease, an extremely rare, terrible and terminal prognosis. There is no cure for Batten Disease and after living only sixteen years, Kennedy leaves behind a great legacy of love and friendship. But her story doesn't end at her death, that's when the miracles really begin. Based on a true story."
