    "overview": "Jordan Klepper is an enlightened, progressive, sartorially aware comedian who's determined to fix America's gun violence epidemic. As his quest takes him from the nation's capital to the deep woods home of the Georgia militia and beyond, one thing is clear: If Jordan can't solve guns, no one can. (Hopefully, this is not true.)"
