Judy is stuck at a dead-end job and is about to make a big move in her life when her boyfriend unexpectedly proposes to her via voicemail. The engagement ring is coming via express mail and she goes to her best friends to help her decide what to do. Alex is a spendthrift who lives way above his means. Nick, secretly in love with Judy, is a writer who can never quite finish his novel. MIXED SIGNALS is a story about love, friendship, loyalty and the choices we all face."
