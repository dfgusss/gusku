    "overview": "The members of a Buenos Aires family have three hobbies — \"berretines\" in Buenos Aires slang — that keep them apart of their duties. Because of that, the family business is going down, and the only one who is concerned is the father, who hopes for his fourth son, an architect, to save the situation."
