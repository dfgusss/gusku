From the moment they meet, the young people, who hate each other, spend most of their vacation trying to ruin it for one another. During their constant bickering, Barış and Zeynep grow closer and fall in love, but before they can fully embrace their feelings, Zeynep's ex-boyfriend suddenly shows up, complicating matters."
