She agrees to help, but only on the condition that Lyubanya will help her regain the man she loved, a certain Valeriy. Lyubanya must \"accidentally\" get acquainted with him and pretend to be his ideal, and when he falls in love with the \"woman of his dreams\" — leave him. Then Simkina will appear to \"glue\" Valeriy's broken heart, and at the same time their broken relationship. Out of desperation, Lyubanya joins in this game, but very quickly realizes that she has fallen in love. The heroine faces the question: how to tell Valeriy the truth about himself and their \"casual\" acquaintance?"
