    "overview": "A horror comedy spoofing conspiracy theory moves, girl victim films, and Alien Grey abduction movies.  Melissa rescues a young woman from a mental hospital where no-one believes she is a victim of abduction by aliens. She and a colleague try to prevent the aliens from taking her but a government agent seems to be hot on her trail, and the Alien Greys and their powerful leader, The Hive Queen have no intention of being stopped. An outrageous mix of graphic horror and dark twisted humor."
