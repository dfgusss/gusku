    "overview": "Tales of the Valley of the Wind  composes an experimental love-letter to the spiritual world of Hayao Miyazaki, re-figuring [Nausicaa] into lush live-action scenes with period costumes, horses, swordplay, and, er...puppets.  All on a tiny budget, Packard implements his signature experimental touch to create a very unique fan-film indeed."
