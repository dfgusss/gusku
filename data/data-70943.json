    "overview": "What makes me a Sikh? That question posed by nine-year-old Zara Garcha starts a family’s journey to learn about their religion. The Garcha family explores Sikhism by visiting diverse Sikh communities around the world: meeting with a Maharaja, cheesemakers, fashionistas, farmers, and scholars to glean a better understanding of the world’s fifth largest religion. Their journey begins in Parma where they meet Sikhs who have a hand in creating Italy’s iconic Parmesan cheese. From there, the Garcha’s head east traveling to India to visit The Golden Temple, and learn about the historical foundations of the religion. As their travels continue their lived experience blends with academic insight and we see how the religion and culture has manifested itself throughout the world."
