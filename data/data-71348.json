    "overview": "Stand up comedian and political commentator Dave Smith's first hour special with the GaS Digital Network. Dave's stand up explores the underbelly of the American political infrastructure and shines a light on our own hypocrisy when it comes to social issues such as racism and sexism. Dave has a fresh approach to political comedy. He doesn't simply align blindly with one side of the political spectrum like many of his contemporaries but would rather call bullsh*t on both sides."
