    "overview": "Charles Schumann is a bartender par excellence—known the world over for his iconic Munich-based Schumann's Bar— and best-selling author of a cocktail guide the New York Times called \"the drink-mixer's bible.\" Here Schumann is your tour guide through some of the finest bars the world has to offer, traveling from New York to Tokyo with numerous stops in between to explore the fascinating history and rich culture behind these monuments to social imbibing, a pursuit all Milwaukeeans agree is in need of extensive documentary study."
