    "overview": "It's midwinter in Minneapolis, and rock musician Thomas (Shane Barach) can't seem to commit to girlfriend Jessica (Lara Miklasevics). At a local coffee shop, he runs into Sabina (Rose Mailutha), whom he knows casually from the club scene, and a relationship develops. But responsibilities lurk in the background since he needs to find work, and she must take care of her young son. With a naturalistic style, filmed in 16mm black-and-white, the film recalls Shadows (1959) an independent films of the early '60s."
