    "overview": "A whimsical blend of live action and animation, \"Saludos Amigos\" is a colorful kaleidoscope of art, adventure and music set to a toe-tapping samba beat. From high Andes peaks and Argentina's pampas to the sights and sounds of Rio de Janeiro, your international traveling companions are none other than those famous funny friends, Donald Duck and Goofy. They keep things lively as Donald encounters a stubborn llama and \"El Gaucho\" Goofy tries on the cowboy way of life....South American-style."
