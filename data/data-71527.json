    "overview": "Attempting to look at the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from a new perspective, documentarian and artist Udi Aloni returns to his native Israel to speak with scholars, activists and politicians on both sides. At the center of his investigation is the Temple Mount, a Jerusalem holy site sacred to both Jews and Arabs. Strongly influenced by the views of his activist mother, Shulamit Aloni, Udi argues for the creation of one state that accommodates both Palestinians and Israelis."
