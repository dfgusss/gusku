    "overview": "At a creative firm somewhere in Stockholm, there's a short break in a meeting. Cecilia relates an anecdote from a hen party, about a 'Turk kiosk' that turned out to be closed. Asal, relatively new at the workplace, questions Cecilia's choice of words, and this seriously offends Cecilia. In the end it's Asal who is accused of inappropriate behaviour."
