    "overview": "Lars Winnerbäck is one of Sweden's biggest artists for 15 years. At the same time he is one of those we know least about. Now Winnerbäck celebrates 20 years as an artist, despite barely filling 40. This documentary takes us closer to him than ever, while summarizing a musically unlikely career. But most of all, it gives an insight into an extremely complex human being, with all its weaknesses and characteristics reflecting an entire generation's feelings. In addition to Lars Winnerbäck is featured in the film Rolf Lassgård, Per Gessle and Melissa Horn. Director and producer are Øystein Karlsen, who is behind successes like Dag og Lilyhammer."
