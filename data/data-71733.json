    "overview": "Charlie is witty, inaccessible and - in her own words - fundamentally dialectic. Hannah is chatty, neurotic, always hungry and always in love. Things take an unexpected turn when one of the girls conjures magical candy that makes body parts talk, pineapples fly and through which a trip to another galaxy becomes the easiest thing in the world."
