    "overview": "In a single, fully-stocked hotel room on the night of the 2016 general election, two Trump supporters celebrate the unexpected results. As the night rages on, an ensemble of characters venture in and out of the room. Some match the two’s enthusiasm while others voice their terror at the prospect of the incoming president, but most struggle to find reasons to care less about the results that caused the debauched celebration occurring around them."
