    "overview": "A quartet of refined elderly ladies gets together for coffee. Neatly dressed in houndstooth and pearls, they sip from elegant china and nibble on sweet cakes while discussing Viagra, cock rings, orgasms and quickies. Nothing's off the table as they reminisce about the past and revel in the sexual revolution that's come up around them, empowering their pleasure well into their twilight years."
