    "overview": "Based on true and tragic events in the life of Vitaly Kaloyev, an architect and family man.  In 2002, his wife and children die in a mid-air collision along with 70 other people, mostly children. Vitaly is one of the first people to discover the bodies of his family at the site of the crash.  The blame is put on the company responsible for monitoring the air space, as well as the lone air traffic controller on duty at the time.  Two years later, after much obstructed efforts to get apologies and answers, Vitaly flies to Switzerland to obtain justice."
