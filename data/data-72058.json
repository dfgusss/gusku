    "overview": "When wannabe-singer Oscar is fired from her band and her boyfriend walks out, she heads to a remote cabin in the woods outside a ghost town called Tarnation to reflect on her life choices. But the woods are home to a demon unicorn, whose satanic master seeks Oscar's blood to complete a ritual that will raise Satan himself from Hell. Oscar must battle with a ungodly force of evil, capable of possessing any soul, to not only save her own life but to stop TARNATION descending upon the world."
