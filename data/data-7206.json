    "overview": "Andy \"Brink\" Brinker and his in-line skating crew--Peter, Jordy, and Gabriella--who call themselves \"Soul-Skaters\" (which means they skate for the fun of it, and not for the money), clash with a group of sponsored skaters, Team X-Bladz--led by Val--with whom they attend high school in southern California. When Brink discovers his family is in financial trouble, he goes against the wishes of his parents and his friends and joins Team X-Bladz. Brink tries to lead a double life but will be able to pull it off?"
