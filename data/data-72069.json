    "overview": "Mark Feinman knows he’s going to be big in show business…it’s just a matter of time. In a flash of inspiration he decides to tour a Shakespeare play around Europe. Undaunted by his inexperience and lack of organisational skills he gathers together probably the worst cast of misfits ever assembled."
