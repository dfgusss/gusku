    "overview": "Humanity discovered a 170,000 year old fossilized skull with a length of 1,850 meters due to an earthquake in Yogyakarta in 2006. The discovery confuses a lot of religious leaders and scientists. Even the world is arguing whether they should research the fossilized skeleton or hide it from the public on behalf of humanitarian reasons. A young girl is trapped in the search for the answer for the mystery behind the skull and the revelation of the truth to the world. If we are indeed not the most perfect beings as we believe, do we really want to know?"
