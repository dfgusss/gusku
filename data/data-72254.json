    "overview": "Above a council estate tower block in London a network of surveillance drones monitor the residents below. Through the eyes of the drones two teenagers are kept apart, each held by police order within the digital confines of their own tower. In this near future city drones form agents of state surveillance but also become co-opted as the aerial vehicles through which two teens fall in love."
