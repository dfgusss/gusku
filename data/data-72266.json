    "overview": "A reflection on Jafa's desire to craft a \"black cinema\" that is responsive to the \"existential, political, and spiritual dimensions\" of Black life. Comprised of found footage sampled from films, newscasts, sporting events, music videos, and citizen videos, all of it downloaded from the Internet, the clips have been woven together and set to Kanye West's anthem \"Ultralight Beam.\" Together the images and music make for an intense, poignant meditation on African American life in the twentieth-century. This history is also the history, by necessity, of racism and prejudice."
