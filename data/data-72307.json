    "overview": "In their last week as housemates, four friends, Tim, Kris, Sebastiaan, and René, unwittingly find themselves in an unfortunate situation where they have to sell an unprecedented amount of cocaine within a week. A particularly difficult task for even the most experienced gangsters, but for these four, who know nothing about the criminal world, it is downright impossible. This insane task will force them to descend deeper and deeper into the depths of criminality. A terrifying and at the same time hilarious journey that pits them directly against the Jewish, Turkish, and Russian drug mafias."
