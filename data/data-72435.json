    "overview": "As punishment, the devil Matěj must grant the wishes of a poor young man named Ondra until he says he is completely happy. But can such happiness even be achieved? Hell has its doubts about this, and it seems that they are justified, as the other devils are well entertained by Matěj's helplessness. After fulfilling ordinary wishes, when Ondra finally warms up, eats well, and gets dressed, more serious complications arise. Ondra falls in love with Rézinka, a countess from the castle, and to make matters worse, the devil Matěj takes a liking to the cook Marjánka."
