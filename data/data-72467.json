    "overview": "Kalin (35) is a talented advertising specialist, weary of life. Bilyana (35) is a free spirit, still uncertain of what she wants. They grew up in Socialist Bulgaria, where they were part of a mad group of friends, for whom every day was a different adventure. Childlike, they had a pact to get married. The two of them meet 25 years later."
