    "overview": "This 1920s home movie, shot by longtime Corpus Christi resident Antonio Rodríguez Fuentes, may well represent some of the earliest produced by a Mexican-American filmmaker about the Mexican-American community in Texas. In the footage, Fuentes captures his five children-Ruben, Ophelia, Mercedes, Antonio, and Carmen-on Christmas Day 1928. The children surround the outdoor Christmas tree, playing with the gifts they received."
