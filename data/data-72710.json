    "overview": "Aging TV star Walter Campbell's attempts to break up with younger girlfriend Lucy are thwarted by the announcement of her pregnancy. Looking for space, Walter resolves to visit his estranged daughter Nic, currently residing in Big Sur, resentful of her father's neglectful parenting and womanizing ways. He agrees to give a lift to Nic's friend Kim, who having recently attended the funeral of her estranged mother, is dealing with her own emotional baggage. Upon arriving in Big Sur, Walter discovers that Nic is living on a lesbian commune, and is in fact due to get married. Nic is appreciative of Walter's acceptance of her sexuality, which sees the pair's relationship begin to repair, but this newly formed bond is at risk of being destroyed once and for all."
