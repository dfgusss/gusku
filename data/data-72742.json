    "overview": "Krishna is the hot-blooded, aimless, flirt of a man from Chittoor whose only aim in life is to find a girl who will love him back. Continents away in Prague is his look-alike Arjun, the playboy rockstar who doesn’t have a problem bedding girls at all. But what happens that brings Krishna and Arjun together is what the film is all about."
