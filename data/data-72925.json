    "overview": "Tonda Blaník announced his presidential candidacy, promising, for example, butter and lithium for every family or corruption accessible to all, and even collected 100,000 signatures. However, he ultimately did not submit his candidacy for the presidency when his assistant Žížala failed to deliver the signature sheets to the Ministry of the Interior on time. Nevertheless, Tonda Blaník continues in his efforts to save the Czech Republic and show its inhabitants how to live better. The feature film follows on from the successful series Kancelář Blaník."
