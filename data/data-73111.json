    "overview": "In a small Scottish town in 1974, factory workers refuse to carry out repairs on warplane engines in an act of solidarity against the violent military coup in Chile. 40 years after their defiant stand in protest against Pinochet's Air Force, Scottish pensioners discover the dramatic consequences of their solidarity."
