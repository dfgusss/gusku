    "overview": "Five vastly different high school girls are assigned to lead an anti-bullying assembly, and in doing so, accidentally form a girl group that they call Drama Drama. The assembly is a hit, and a classmate convinces them to form a real band. As they write songs together, play at the homecoming dance, and prepare for a concert outside school, the band must navigate their own teenage drama: boys they like, jealous 'frenemies', the stress of passing their final year, and deciding their futures."
