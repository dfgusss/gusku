    "overview": "Ruta Meilutyte is one of the most recognizable and likeable people in Lithuania. She inspires the young generation to chase their goals and the rest of us - to be proud of Lithuania. Ruta is much more than a great athlete, she is the symbol of today's Lithuania. Currently a documentary is being produced that will allow the viewers to see Ruta's daily life from up close and hopefully understand a bit more about the amount of hard work that goes into preparing for this short distance swim."
