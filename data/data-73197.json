    "overview": "When a party bus on it's way to the Burning Man music festival breaks down in the desert and in the middle of a group of Satanic devil worshippers, all hell literally breaks loose. A massacre leaves seven survivors trapped in the bus, fighting for their lives while wondering if someone or others are not who they seem."
