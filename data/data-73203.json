    "overview": "Ricky is a young Arab Australian whose peaceful suburban life is turned on its head when his sister, Ameena, disappears without trace. In a climate of distrust and xenophobia, she is soon suspected of having joined the ranks of ISIS in Syria. In a ‘post-facts’ world, Ricky no longer knows who to believe, his sense of what’s right or the 24 hour media cycle of spin."
