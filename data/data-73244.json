    "overview": "In a future in which the earth has been sent out of control, affected by a cruel and inhuman mechanism that turns back Darwin's theory of Evolution, Hamming and Liv try to survive. It seems that nothing can stand in the way of their relationship, but every person gradually starts to feel animal instincts: uncontrolled aggression, protection of offspring, spontaneous sexual desire. When Liv disappears, Hamming has to make an important step – to face the world endangering his very own life in order to find her."
