    "overview": "1968. Catherine, Yves and Hervé are twenty years old. They're students in Paris and they love each other. The May student uprisings radically change their lives. Overtaken by communal utopia, they leave the city with a few friends to set up house in an abandoned farm in the Lot region. A desire for freedom and the search for individual fulfillment lead them to make choices that cause them to separate."
