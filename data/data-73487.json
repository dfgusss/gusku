    "overview": "The youngest son returns home to help his father and brothers meet the targets for a profitable order on cut wood. During his absence nothing has changed: the same back-breaking toil for the sake of a piece of bread, the same resistance from the neighbouring settlement, the same inability of the family members to express their love and understanding for their kin. And the river, which may rise at any time and wash away the parental home that stands on its banks."
