    "overview": "What if pain was merely a set up for the ultimate surprise party? Genie Burns, owner of Surprise Enterprise, masterminds off the wall surprise parties in nobody would-suspect-it locations. Here she takes crazy risks but in her love life, she plays it safe. Her partner Steven, who hilariously calls her out on every issue she owns, is gay which makes him safe. Danny, her friend from college would be perfect for her but she keeps him in the friend zone. Along comes Jeff, everything she avoids, but his charm and depth draw her in. Is he the right one because he challenges her fears, or the wrong one because he implodes them?"
