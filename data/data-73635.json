    "overview": "Rafi arrives at Fali's house with his suitcase in tow because his wife has kicked him out of the house. It is not the first time this has happened, although this time everything will be different, since the mess Rafi has gotten himself into this time... He is one of the big ones. Fali would like to help her friend, but she is in a hurry: tomorrow will be her son's First Communion and all she has to do as a father is take the child's suit to the farm where the event will be held. During the next twenty-four hours, and with the clock counting down stalking them, the compadres will manage to get out of various messes to get into new entanglements."
