    "overview": "Life of Czechoslovak soldiers in a military unit for the so called \"politically unreliable\" - the Technical auxiliary battalions, aka \"the black barons\". Although it might seem like a political satire and it's mostly funny, it shows the reality and the absurdity of military service under the communist regime. Based on a novel by Miloslav Svandrlik."
