    "overview": "With this film-manifesto, the two artists invent what they called the Cinéma corporel (Cinema of the Body), they present themselves as a \"double auteur femme\" and they lay the foundations of the radical critical and esthetical positions of their work to come. Double Labyrinthe has a mirror structure based on their \"mutual gaze\": in the first part Katerina performs while filmed by Maria and in the second part Maria performs filmed by Katerina."
