    "overview": "Freddy Lupin, heir to a proud family line of werewolves, is in for a shock when on his 14th birthday his first 'warfing' goes awry, turning him into a ferocious poodle.  The pack elders give Freddy until the next moonrise to prove he has the heart of a wolf, or risk being cast out forever.  With the help of an unlikely ally in a streetwise stray named Batty, Freddy must prove he's 100% Wolf."
