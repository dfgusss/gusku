    "overview": "Agathe Villanova is a self-centered, workaholic feminist politician who, upon reluctantly returning to her home in the south of France to sort out her mother's affairs, runs for a local election. Upon her arrival, Agathe grudgingly agrees to take part in a documentary being made by the blundering duo of Karim, an aspiring filmmaker, and self-professed \"reporter\" Michel, on the subject of \"successful women.\" As Agathe's life hilariously unravels, the camera is there to capture it all."
