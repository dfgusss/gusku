    "overview": "Life in the Doghouse tells the inspiring story behind Danny & Ron’s Rescue, a dog rescue centre. Started by life partners Ron Danta and Danny Robertshaw, the two men were moved to act after Hurricane Katrina left thousands of dogs stranded and abandoned. The two men set up a makeshift dog sanctuary in their home and ten years later they have housed and rescued over 10,000 of these furry babies."
