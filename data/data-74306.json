    "overview": "Eva is a young and independent cartoonist who returns to Málaga (Spain) to spend the summer holidays. There she meets her mother and Gema, her best friend. What she does not expect is to meet again with Rubén, her old boyfriend, with whom she has not had any contact since he broke off all relations with her unexpectedly, without farewells, six years ago. Eva will have to think about whether to give Rubén a second chance while she remembers her past, as well as the reason why the young man decided to get away from her."
