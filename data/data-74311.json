    "overview": "Fabiana is a seasoned trucker who has crisscrossed and conquered the roads of Brazil for 30 years. The fact that she is transgender doesn’t seem to make any difference for her nomadic life. In many places, she can hook up with a variety of women and is in her element among the guys on the road. Now she is approaching retirement, Fabiana realises her life will change drastically. Her house, where she lives with her girlfriend when not on the road, will become her new world."
