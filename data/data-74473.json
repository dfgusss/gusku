    "overview": "The Greenhouse is a magic-realist drama that centres on the eldest child of two women, Beth, who discovers a portal into the past on their family property. On the cusp of her widowed mother Ruth's sixtieth birthday and the return of her dysfunctional siblings Drew, Doonie and Raf, Beth is swept away by visions of their idyllic childhood and re-lives the moments that defined her adolescence. Despite Ruth's warnings, and as real-world tensions grow between the siblings, Beth becomes dependant on the greenhouse, soon realising it isn't the paradise she believed it to be."
