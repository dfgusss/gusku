    "overview": "It's Christmas Eve, 1986, and Borja is a precocious teenager with a passion for film. As his family comes together to celebrate the holiday, the combined forces of the suffocating Chilean heat, free-flowing drinks, and repressed desire contribute to the eruption of long-held secrets. Both an enticing family melodrama and an explicit erotic thriller, this is a story about the ways that passion and desire control our lives—from pop-culture tastes to sexual fantasies."
