    "overview": "This film shows how far we have come since the cold-war days of the 50s and 60s. Back then the Russians were our \"enemies\". And to them the Americans were their \"enemies\" who couldn't be trusted. Somewhere in all this a young girl in Oklahoma named Shannon set her sights on becoming one of those space explorers, even though she was told \"girls can't do that.\" But she did."
