    "overview": "Stage star Anna Held (1872-1918) riffs on her once-famous scene from the comedy Papa's Wife (1899-1901) featuring a naif getting tipsy on her first champagne, in this \"photographic interview\", filmed in 68mm by Frederick S. Armitage. AM&B's Picture Catalogue of 1902 pitched it as \"A stunning picture of the well-known actress in the drinking scene which made such a hit in Papa's Wife. The figure is shown in bust view, making the head very large and giving a clear view of the facial expressions of the beautiful artiste.\" The company said that both \"make hits either in the Biograph [35mm projection service] or Mutoscope\" [hand-cranked peep-show viewer]."
