    "overview": "Isra and Cheito are two brothers who have taken very different paths in life. When Isra gets released from prison and Cheito comes home after a long tour with the Marines, they both return to the island of San Fernando. The reunion of the two brothers will bring with it the memory of the violent death their father suffered when they were just boys; the need to get back on track with their lives and finally come to terms with what happened will bring them together again."
