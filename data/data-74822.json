    "overview": "The Narrator (Canek Denis) finds himself with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change his precarious lifestyle for a brand new life of never-ending lust and limitless power. But the price to pay is too high. He must surrender that which represents everything he has been up to that moment, that which defines him as a person: his ideas. He now must make a choice that will scar him for the rest of his life, much like a stain that simply cannot be removed."
