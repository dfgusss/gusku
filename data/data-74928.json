    "overview": "Haitian poet, critic and actor Dominique Batraville rummages through a library of literature and curios while drifting between recitations, musings and memories in a hypnotic stream of consciousness. The film is shot inside his cramped Port-au-Prince home, and yet it conjures a portrait of an entirely offscreen world. Song of a Seer reveals the intangible qualities lurking beneath surfaces—and points to the infinite space of the human mind."
