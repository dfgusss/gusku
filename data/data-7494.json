    "overview": "Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Owl, Kanga, Roo, and Rabbit are preparing a suitable winter home for Eeyore, the perennially dejected donkey, but Tigger's continual bouncing interrupts their efforts. Rabbit suggests that Tigger go find others of his kind to bounce with, but Tigger thinks \"the most wonderful thing about tiggers is\" he's \"the only one!\" Just in case though, the joyously jouncy feline sets out to see if he can find relatives."
