    "overview": "Two friends, young psychiatrists, perceive life in different ways. One wants to do the right thing. The second is to experiment. One is a diligent student. The second is the troublemaker. One loves, hating. The second hates, loving. It's a pity that they have only one passion - Katerina Sergeevna. For one, she is Mom, Dad's wife. For another - a lover."
