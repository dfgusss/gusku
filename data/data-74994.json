    "overview": "Symbol in the eyes of urbanites of an authentic nature, the French forest is going through an unprecedented phase of industrialization. Heavy mechanization, monocultures, fertilizers and pesticides, forest management follows the intensive agricultural model at high speed. From Limousin to Landes, from Morvan to Vosges, Le Temps des Forêts offers a journey to the heart of industrial forestry and its alternatives. Living forest or wooded desert, today's choices will shape the landscape of tomorrow."
