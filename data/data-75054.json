Also vying for Bethany’s attention is Lyle Macdonald, a spiritual pogey bum and the nemesis of Gary Gallant. After Bethany gets a taste of working for cash under the table, she plans the ultimate job that goes horribly wrong. With everyone in pogey jail, can Gary and Lyle put aside their differences and save Pogey Beach?"
