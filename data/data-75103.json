In 1984, police in Washington State are investigating a spate of serial murders committed by a mysterious man known as The Green River Killer. With no leads to go on, the detective in charge of the case consults with psychologists in an attempt to get inside the mind of the killer.

So he visits the imprisoned Ted Bundy, one of the most notorious serial killers in American history."
