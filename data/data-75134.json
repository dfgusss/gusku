    "overview": "Extreme sport lover Zhou Feng got involved in an international illegal trade by accident. So he had to follow an international special agent Bruce to Budapest. Together with a crappy police officer Miao Yan, a non-professional scientist Ding Shan and an unemployed doctor LV, they became an amateur unit. In company with the senior agent Bruce, these four rookies started a fight with the terrorists that was both thrilling and hilarious."
