    "overview": "A persistent rain falls on Zagreb. That day Janko finally decides to take the threads of his life in his own hands. For him this means, before anything, an attempt to establish a relationship with Iva who he has wanted to approach for some time followed by dealing with his aging father Franjo, a miserable translator who needs an escort to an award ceremony where he will receive an award for lifetime achievement. Iva and Franjo have their own secrets that they don't want to keep to themselves and also ideas of how this rainy day should go. Someone should, in the end, walk the dog."
