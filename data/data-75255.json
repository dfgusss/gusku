    "overview": "As Christmas approaches, Elizabeth Bennett, a New York event planner is sent to a quaint, small town to organize a holiday festival. When she arrives, she finds William Darcy, a high-profile billionaire lacking in holiday spirit, in the process of selling the charming estate she hoped to use as a venue. Elizabeth persuades the reluctant Darcy to let her hold the festival on the historical estate and, before long, the unlikely pair begins falling for each other."
