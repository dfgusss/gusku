    "overview": "“Keep it clean!” – The new president is serious about that, including looks. When Paul, whose large jug ears are quite apparent on class photo day, and some of the other “ugly” kids are taken on a surprise trip, they realize that the president wants to hide them away. On the run, Paul is helped by Sara, one of the “pretty” kids. They start an underground club to fight against the president. The movement soon turns into a revolution. The kids show the world that even children can rise up – and that you don’t have to be “pretty” to be a hero!"
