    "overview": "THESE ARE MY HOURS is the story of a single birth -- start to finish. This intimate documentary immersion into one woman's physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual experience of giving birth is the first film told from the perspective of a woman in labor. Just after midnight on December 6, 2016, a contraction awakens Emily Graham, in bed at home in Greenville, South Carolina. Labor is finally here. Over the ensuing hours Emily navigates the depths of her own body, with the support of her birth team: her husband Jason, her midwife Carey, and her mother Judy. You are invited to join them and be a witness to Emily every step of the way - It is said, \"When a child is born, a mother is born too.\" THESE ARE MY HOURS is the story of this transformation, celebrating womanhood by honoring its oldest ritual: giving birth."
