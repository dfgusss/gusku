    "overview": "He appears to be a subtle, intelligent embodiment of (German) Swissness. He is the only popular Swiss intellectual. But does that mean we really know Peter Bichsel, our modern folk writer? Peter Bichsel is an expert on Paris, but has never been there himself. In this film, he ventures on a journey. It takes him to room 202 at the Hotel Gare de l'Est in the station of the same name, but no further."
