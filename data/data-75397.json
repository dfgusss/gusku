When Matthew, a charming real estate developer, tries to buy the town for a corporate ski resort, Allison and the townspeople must work together to prevent that from happening. And just when the Bennet ladies seem out of luck, an unexpected visitor – with a well-known sweet tooth for cookies and milk – comes to the bakery and may in fact be the key to solving everything."
