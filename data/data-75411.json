    "overview": "Vasyl Serediuk - head of the local Museum - having sent his daughter Kateryna to a french university, never expected the outcome: a month ago she informed him that she is getting married to a French heart surgeon François. Since then Vasyl’s proud statement spread throughout the whole region: “The Serediuks  have made their European choice!\".  How huge was his surprise when he saw that the cherished European future son-in-law is a Frenchman of African origin. Organizing a wedding so that it never happens seems like a brilliant idea. But when true love stands in the way, the success of such plan is not a given."
