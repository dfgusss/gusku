    "overview": "Starring Reuter Christiansen herself and shot in the lush landscape of Møn, the Danish island where she has lived since 1970, THE EXECUTIONER uses a fragmented narrative to tell “a story of woman’s degradation and exaltation,” as its subtitle indicates. A landmark of Danish feminist art, the film was also Reuter Christiansen’s first major collaboration with Henning, who composed the film’s lyrical, subtly experimental music."
