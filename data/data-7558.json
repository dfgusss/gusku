Join Stephen and his friends—Toby Keith, Elvis Costello, John Legend, Feist, Willie Nelson, and Jon Stewart —for a yuletide evening of song, dance and nog-induced dementia. (Parental discretion is advised.) Remember, every time you buy a copy of Stephen Colbert’s Christmas Special, an angel gets his wings."
