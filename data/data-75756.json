    "overview": "Upon discovering a coded message in the self help book \"6 Dynamic Laws for Success (In Life, Love & Money)\" which purportedly reveals the location of $2.4 million missing from a bank robbery gone bad, a demoralized ex-used car salesman sets out on a quest to find the money and remake himself in the process. However, he soon discovers he’s not the only one after the cash, and that the road to riches and self-improvement is littered with irate ex-wives, litigious fiancés, household calamities, accidental murders, and love at first sight."
