    "overview": "A moody love story featuring a cat and mouse. Even if we are lucky enough to love and be loved, deep down we remain a bit lonely. The film talks about how dearly we have to pay for our inability to endure this loneliness. About the fact that we must take care of love carefully, because returning to a loved one may prove impossible, even if there is a glowing longing on both sides. A broken diamond can no longer be glued together."
