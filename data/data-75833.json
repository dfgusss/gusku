    "overview": "\"In an asylum, patients were subjected to watching horror films for psychiatric study... but they all went mad and now those films have been unearthed!\" claims the product description. In reality, the \"story\" is told with silly title cards over random abandoned asylum shots while long scenes from eleven different 70s and 80s horror films are edited in."
