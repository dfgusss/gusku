    "overview": "Pauline Schwebe is a police officer and single. She is touched when she discovers Leo Golombeck's handwritten wish list at a traffic light. In it, the seven-year-old invites a lonely soul to a Christmas party with his family. In return, he wouldn't mind if the lonely soul brought a few presents. Pauline visits Leo, who lives in modest circumstances with his sister Lotte and his dad Daniel. As Pauline's parents are constantly nagging her that she is still single, she quickly invites Daniel and his children to the family Christmas party and introduces him as her new boyfriend."
