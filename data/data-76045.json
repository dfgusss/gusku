    "overview": "A girl is possessed by a dark and mysterious entity. She will fight with all the elements at her disposal to get rid of it. Neither her mother, nor traditional medicine, nor a supposed expert in exorcisms, will be able to make the demon disappear, until a nun gets involved in the case and sows a doubt more terrible than the possession itself."
