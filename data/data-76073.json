His training takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself getting between the marital engagement of two old friends, Emily and John. Unaware of Ivan's secret relationship with his fiancé, John invites Ivan to go on a hiking trip with him. In order to keep up appearances, Ivan agrees to go along. On the trip, John grows ever more suspicious of Ivan's intentions with Emily. A dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues that might provide Ivan an unexpected route to a cure."
