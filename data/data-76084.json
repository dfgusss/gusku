    "overview": "After the fall of civilization, man has repeated the same mistakes again and installed a new system of law based on false science and superstitious beliefs. This reaches its climax when it comes to the “Chisa” flower, because anyone who dares to touch it is banished from the village and has to live a life of loneliness and poverty. The most vulnerable to this deviation are children, as their natural curiosity makes them fall prey to temptation."
