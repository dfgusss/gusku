    "overview": "Claudia travels to Iceland for her son Patrick's dream wedding. She has a big surprise in store: she is the mysterious \"new girl\" of his best friend Alex, who has even proposed to her and wants to turn the ceremony into a double wedding. However, the secret lovers are waiting for the right time to tell the unsuspecting Patrick. Both fear that he will be less than thrilled. Shortly after arriving in Reykjavik, Patrick receives a phone call that throws everything out of kilter for him: his fiancée Anna cancels at the last minute! He also receives bad news from the start-up he set up with Alex in Hamburg. Patrick would love to fly back immediately, but a volcanic eruption puts a spanner in the works. Instead of a celebration and honeymoon, he has to pass the time with Alex, Claudia and his assistant Nina. Nina also has a secret agenda: to conquer Patrick."
