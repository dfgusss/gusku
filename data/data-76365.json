    "overview": "An Agent from the future comes to the past to prevent crimes. The only way for him to return to the future is simply to wait. During this time, he must live in complete isolation. This would drive most men insane, but it suits the solitary agent just fine... until one day, when he runs into a girl about to commit suicide."
