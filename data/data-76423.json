    "overview": "As a novelist, actress/screenwriter for François Ozon and director, Marina de Van is fearless, always eager to deal with taboos and expose herself. Mostly home-made and shot under the radar, Ma nudité ne sert à rien is a brave self-portrait of de Van as a forty-something wandering soul, asking herself about her work, body and relationships in the age of dating apps and one-night stands."
