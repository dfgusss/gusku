He thinks his luck has turned when Blue's son, Fatboy, and his best friend, Spyda,, bring him a stash of stolen cellphones, and Black decides to sell them on the streets. There's only one problem: The boxes with the phones also contain the Colombian cartel's stash of Molly, which Spyda decides to sell."
