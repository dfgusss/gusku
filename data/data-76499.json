    "overview": "A group of friends from São Paulo head for a secluded beach to celebrate New Year’s. Together they relax, sunbathe and make music. And they talk: about their sexuality, their bodies, their hair, their youth, their fears, certainties and uncertainties, as anyone does sometimes with good friends. Along the way, we learn a lot about contemporary Brazil."
