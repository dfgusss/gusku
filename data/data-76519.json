    "overview": "Observes the mechanisms of construction and assimilation of gender in contemporary Italian society, through a kaleidoscopic mosaic of scenes of daily life: what are the choreographies of bodies, collective rituals, behaviors for each of the genres that condition our identities? Through paintings with a strong visual impact, Normal tells the story of normality making it alien to us, exploring the daily and collective staging of the male and female universe in which we all participate."
