    "overview": "Based on real events. In a densely forested area north of St. Petersburg people have been going missing for three decades. The few corpses ever found were naked. On October 14, 2017 a team of volunteers went out into the woods in search of a missing teenager. Soon, all communication with them was lost. Locals believe they were taken by the same dark spirit that took the others. They call it the Limping Widow."
