    "overview": "Pete is a gay man from Philadelphia whose fear of intimacy leads him to getting involved with married men. His father Ron, and his soon-to-be step mom, Pamela, are on him to find someone who's actually available and to settle down. Instead, he finds a man named Jack who is fifteen years into a perfect marriage with two beautiful children and an enviable wife. This will force both men to confront what they really want in their romantic lives."
