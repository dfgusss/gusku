    "overview": "Charlotte and Brandon meet online just after their previous relationships have imploded; in an effort to make themselves more appealing, they have fudged, exaggerated, re-imagined, and outright lied about their pasts in an attempt to be each other's perfect match. Now that they've said their \"I do's\" they are about to get a funny, hellish, and eye-opening look at just who they've vowed to spend the rest of their lives with. Will familiarity breed contempt... or bliss?"
