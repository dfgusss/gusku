    "overview": "Even though everyday life separates them, sisters Rike and Nicola go on vacation together once a year. They take it in turns to organize their trip. Their trips are just as different as the two of them themselves, so that the trip to Salamanca in Spain once again presents new challenges. Because what Rike doesn't know is that Nicola has organized a volunteering vacation on the Camino de Santiago for the sisters."
