    "overview": "Rebekka, Claudia and Sofie are freshmen in high school and will no longer accept being treated as juniors. Taking matters into their own hands, they devise a rite of passage, the 'fortune teller', symbolizing their entry into adulthood. As they take turns challenging each other's sexual boundaries, they eventually have to ask themselves whether performing weird rituals is the easiest way to get to know themselves and feel grown up."
