    "overview": "A filmmaker follows his friend and widowed airline pilot east and west around the world, as he searches to find new love via the dating app Tinder. The well-intended quest spirals into a controversial fly on the wall expose of one man’s addictive and outlandish behaviour in a bubble of vice and depravity that conflicts with his consummate professionalism."
