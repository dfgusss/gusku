    "overview": "LITTLE GERMANS combines animation and documentary film to tell the story of children that are born into extreme right-wing families. From a young age on they are trained to hate everything that seems 'foreign'. How does it feel to grow up in a world, where empathy is subsidiary and 'the nation' stands above everything? And who do those 'little Germans' become once they grow up?"
