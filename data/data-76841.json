    "overview": "Adam, Siwy and Dworaczek are teenage boys from poor Silesian families. They spend their time wandering around dumps, robbing cars. From time to time they try to sell the stolen items, but usually get into brawls with adults in the process. One day the boys are faced with the possibility of making their \"big heist.\" However, it turns out that this act brings them nothing - neither a sense of success nor money. Will their dreams of escaping the monotonous, tedious reality never come true?"
