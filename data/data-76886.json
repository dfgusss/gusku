    "overview": "This film talks about the possibility of the course of two lives through the love between Umut and Deniz. It questions how one’s decisions can shape their fate. Sometimes small moments and decisions can entirely change the course of our lives. Umut’s decision to take his dog Oscar for an evening walk allows his path to cross Deniz’s. On that night, Umut will have to decide between a gateway which leads to love and a life which he needs to face and encounter on his own."
