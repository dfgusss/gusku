    "overview": "In 1979, Toasters ‘N’ Moose formed, put out one album, and disbanded. Now 30 years later, their old manager (and his niece) has brought them together again for a 3 day tour of Northern California. Featuring their now classic hit “Rock Your Body Home” and live performances of many more great songs, our cameras follow on this less-than-historic tour."
