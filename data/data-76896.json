    "overview": "Simon Reeve visits Colombia in the year of the pacification, at least on paper, between the government, 'aided' by right-wing death squads, and the Marxist FARC guerrilla, which was turning into an armed super-drug cartel and champion of ransom kidnappings. He speaks with people about the horror that hopefully nears its end and the prospects if both sides disarm."
