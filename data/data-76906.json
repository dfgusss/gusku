    "overview": "For some reason, forever young and always immaculately dressed, Koschey has been unable to find a bride for three hundred years. He intimidated, and kidnapped, and turned various princesses into frogs, but these courtship did not help the prince of darkness. Meanwhile, the beautiful hero Varvara only does what she fights off in the arena from suitors who covet her dowry. However, having taken possession of the Koshcheev needle, Tsar Peas figure out how to get to Varvara. But he didn’t take into account one thing - although Koshchei’s death is enclosed in a needle, love can still come to life in his heart"
