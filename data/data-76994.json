    "overview": "It's the 1980s in rural Ghana, and Atswei is heavily pregnant and desperate to get to Ateke to deliver her baby. But when she and husband Boi miss the morning train — the only means of transport to the city — the hapless couple are left stranded in the blazing sun with only Boi's boombox for encouragement. A madcap race against time follows in this colorful screwball comedy, with wry but affectionate nods to Ghanaian traditions and gender dynamics."
