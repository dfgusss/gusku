    "overview": "Every year, hundreds of people go missing after using online classified ads. No case is as bizarre and unexplainable as this. In November of 2017, a broken video camera and smart phone were recovered from a recycling centre. The camera houses a memory card that contained disturbing and unexplainable material. This is that material. The following is not for viewers of a sensitive disposition."
