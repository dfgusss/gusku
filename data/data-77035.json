    "overview": "What if the apostle Paul came to our times? An old man in First Century Rome is about to be executed. Before he is killed, he is “translated” in time and space to the current time to Rome, Oregon. He is picked up by a young disillusioned truck driver, who finds out the old man makes some amazing claims."
