    "overview": "A father is working the controls of a railroad track, allowing approaching passenger trains to cross safely over the bridge. As one approaches, he sees his young son coming toward him on the tracks. It is at this moment the father must decide whom to save - the train full of passengers -- or his son. This powerful film poignantly illustrates the meaning of God allowing His son to die to save us."
