    "overview": "This film is Álex Montoya's first feature film: an interesting adaptation of the play La gente by Juli Disla and Jaume Pérez, also screenwriters of the film. The emergence of assembly groups after the political movements after 2011 served their authors to cast a comic look at decision-making processes and the capacity for dialogue of the human being."
