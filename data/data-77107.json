    "overview": "An atmospheric mood piece photographed in the winter at the giant dam built by Hydro Quebec in the northern wilds of the province.  The story concerns a worker's wife, who is bored with her dreary existence in the wilderness.  She walks around in the snow recalling how she met her husband, then goes to the landing field to catch a departing plane.  But she remains when her husband tells her how much his work means to him.  This moving and very humanistic tale represents the NFB at its best."
