    "overview": "Jake, a college drop out, along with his friends decide to take their homophobia to a whole other level when when they decide to download a gay oriented social media app where they would lure and attack innocent victims. Noah, a just coming to terms gay teen, doesn't know who to talk to about his feelings and turns to the same social media app the attackers use on their prey. Told from both perspectives of the main characters and a chilling conclusion that will alter everyone's lives forever."
