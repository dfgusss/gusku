    "overview": "The Munich LKA officer Sandra Rutkowski received an anonymous call in which a star tenor from the Munich State Opera was accused of molesting children. A boy brought to him is said to be locked in the cloakroom of the singer, who is still being celebrated on the stage. When Sandra and the Munich inspector Lukas Laim break down the door to the cloakroom, they find an intimidated, apathetic boy in the closet."
