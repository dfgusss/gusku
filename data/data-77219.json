    "overview": "1984, Sverdlovsk, USSR. A shy freshman, an entrepreneur, a poet and two charming it-girls navigate life in a student dorm, sharing their griefs and joys, all for one and one for all. Suddenly a horrible accident blows up the life of the dorm when a female student commits suicide. The dorm is a miniature model of the world that encapsulates the full range of human passions, acts of bravery and cowardice, aspirations for virtue and failures, of love, friendship and betrayal."
