She actually doesn't want anything to do with the LKA. But she has no choice. In \"Der Fall Lissabon\" she has to spy on a star lawyer who launders money for terrorist cells. Should she refuse, the life of her sister and that of her niece is threatened. Crime scene inspector Aylin Tezel embodies a brave young woman who gets caught between the fronts and can only rely on her instinct."
