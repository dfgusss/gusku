    "overview": "Jill and Joy receive a mission from their neighbors Tingelstein and Tangelstein: the ladies send the girls to look after their absentminded inventor brother Gadgetus. Jill and Joy get to know the wonders of Gadgetus’s farm, but everything is at risk of being destroyed when Samuel Shortcut arrives on his bulldozer, ready to destroy everything so that a new highway can be built in the area. Jill and Joy save the farm with the help of a device invented by Gadgetus, but before that they have to get to know the world of dreams and find help from there. Armstrong, a miniature pig, also takes part in the adventure and helps Jill and Joy, along with the other people living in Rose Alley."
