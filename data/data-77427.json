    "overview": "Sasha has three problems: a girl who wants a wedding, which he cannot decide on, because he is only a veterinary paramedic and cleans the ears of dogs, parents, because mom doesn’t like Olya, and dad doesn’t like his job because Sasha cleans ears for dogs, and third - Olya's mother doesn't like him, because ... yes, because he cleans dogs' ears. On New Year's Eve, everyone gathers at Sasha's house to celebrate his birthday, because he was born on January 1. Olya has prepared a gift for him - he will soon become a dad! In order to be alone with his thoughts for a while, Sasha hides in the toilet. By pressing the flush, he finds himself ... in his parents' apartment two hours before his birth. And in the yard on December 31, 1992."
