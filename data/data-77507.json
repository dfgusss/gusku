    "overview": "It's London, 1892 and Defendant 47 is on trial but can't remember who he is. He only can remember a few details, where he's been lately and glimpses of the past. Defendant 47 slowly starts remembering that he's mathematician who runs a photography studio. He now remembers that his preferred subject were children. Through them, he met Ellen Rhodes, the one who will only bring him to a dark end."
