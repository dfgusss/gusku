    "overview": "How does a book of war game rules written in 1880 lead directly to the creation of Dungeons & Dragons nearly a hundred years later?  Secrets of Blackmoor is the two-hour documentary film resulting from an unprecedented exploration into the evolution of Role Playing Games (RPG's) that reveals the true origin of Dungeons & Dragons.  It's the story of the invention of Role Playing Games as told by the people who were there: the Twin Cities Gamers.  If you think D&D is the beginning of the story, then think again: D&D is actually the end of the beginning."
