    "overview": "Based on his book, Michael Waltrip recounts the 2001 Daytona 500 and the lighting-fast transition from elation to mourning - as he took the checkered flag to win while Dale Earnhardt, his friend and team owner, crashed in Turn 4 behind him. Earnhardt's death and the events of the race had a profound effect on Waltrip, shown in this documentary."
