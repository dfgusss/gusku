    "overview": "Maria married an honest worker at a very young age, works as a part-time beautician and has three children. Her life is like many others in the working-class suburbs of Naples, where the daily struggle to make ends meet makes you get used to everything. When her husband is diagnosed with a terminal illness, Maria accepts the help of Gennaro, a rich owner of a car dealership. She lets him court her until she becomes his lover. One day he suggests that she become a business partner: he will transport a load of cocaine to Switzerland. Once she becomes a widow, her relationship with Gennaro will make her fall into a criminal vortex, which will finally allow her to experience new possibilities and fulfill old dreams. But the path chosen by Maria for her personal revenge will leave its inevitable victims in its wake, just like in a war that does not look anyone in the face."
