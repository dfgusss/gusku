    "overview": "Violet Evergarden comes to a private women's academy to tutor Isabella in the ways of being a lady. Heir to the York family, Isabella feels trapped in this new and uncomfortable world. She still grieves for the only person to ever bring her happiness – now lost to her. Violet's lessons do give her a brief respite from the melancholy but with the absence of joy, how long does it take to truly heal?"
