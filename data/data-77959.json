    "overview": "When Ana, a young compliance manager, discovers unusually high bills among her company's records, she can't imagine what an avalanche her research will set off. Not only does she cross paths with an aging small-time crook and a Viennese Mafia lord at an illegal bare-knuckle fight, she also runs into Carsten, an undercover investigator. He has long been on the trail of a network of money launderers and now faces a difficult decision — since he knows Ana all too well."
