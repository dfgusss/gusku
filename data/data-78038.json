    "overview": "For three days in August 1969, nearly a half-million young people descended upon Max Yasgur's farm in upstate New York for the rock 'n' roll event that defined a generation. Mythologized for 50 years, the filmmakers set the record straight with \"Creating Woodstock,\" the most comprehensive examination of how the festival came to be."
