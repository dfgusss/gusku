    "overview": "Franck and Karine are offered a job on a cruise ship they can’t refuse.

But this is the moment when the second grandfather Teddy, an eccentric and wild former nightclub manager and the total opposite of the strict André, chooses to return after many years abroad... Living together promises to be complicated…"
