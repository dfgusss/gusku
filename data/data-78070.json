    "overview": "Students of different careers prepare to take final exams. Botany, anatomy, sociology, medieval philosophy, criminal law, morphology, theoretical physics and piano. Each one uses their own abilities to cope with the situation of oral exposure, the most common evaluative practice in the National Universities of Argentina. Throughout the waiting moments in the halls, between the drama and the absurdity of each exam, the subjects begin to find unexpected relationships."
