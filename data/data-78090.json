    "overview": "Umut has been a thief since he was a kid. He constantly seeks the opportunity of his life and his family. He can't find either. Gülüm is a young girl who has no problems in her life, who has completed her schooling on time and is only a step away from her dreams. But before she takes that step towards her dreams, she hangs and falls. It is understood that Gülüm has liver failure. She'll die if she doesn't have a liver transplant. The fate of Umut and Gülüm merge at this point. Umut found the opportunity he had waited for the rest of his life. But this opportunity drags Umut into very difficult situations, and finds itself in a position that risks the lives of all loved ones. For Umut to come out of this vortex, he has to make very serious decisions. And love is worth everything? Is this love?"
