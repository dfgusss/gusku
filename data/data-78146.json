    "overview": "Everyone has seen a Trumbull sequence in Stanley Kubrick's \"2001 A Space Odyssey\", Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" or Steven Spielberg's \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Recognized and respected SFX maestro, he has also directed two full-length films which left their mark on sci-fi cinema: \"Silent Running\" and \"Brainstorm\". Today, at over 70, Trumbull-the-pioneer continues his quest for innovation and still dreams of a cinema which places spectators into the film. \"Trumbull Land\" is an immersive portrait of Douglas Trumbull in his studios and a diving headfirst in his cinema."
