    "overview": "In 2007 Cristina Vázquez, a native of Posadas, settled in Buenos Aires, built a life, made new friends. I am one of her new friends. We work together in a restaurant. In that place happens the police raid that turns my friend Cristina into the queen of the hammer: a young woman rampant, drug addict and promiscuous who is also a murderer. Months later, without evidence, she is tried and sentenced to life imprisonment. Fragments of an unknown friend in the story who wrote to Cristina Vázquez in the perfect suspect. A story that, without convincing evidence, is still in jail today."
