That is the extremely painful lesson that Ryan is learning right now, as specters of his past life of crime have returned to haunt him, destroying the only person he holds dear, and nearly killing him in the process. Ryan decides that if he cannot escape then he must confront them head-on in what can only be called a desperate suicide run."
