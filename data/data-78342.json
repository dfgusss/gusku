    "overview": "Filmmaker Paul Puglisi traveled across the US to make sense of the controversy surrounding of one of America's most enduring symbols - Christopher Columbus. Conversations with cultural leaders, historians, activists, authors and educators bring to life the perspectives that molded a 15th century sailor into a genocidal conqueror, a messenger of Christ, a cultural icon and a patriotic hero in a land he never knew existed."
