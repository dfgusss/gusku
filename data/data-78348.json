    "overview": "On the surface 19-year-old Mirjam's life appears perfect. She is a world champion freestyle disco dancer and the pride of her modern, evangelical church. Yet her body is calling out for help and at the dance world championships, where she is defending her title, she collapses on stage. Her family's solution is for her to focus more on her faith. In search of answers, she turns to a stricter, more conservative church."
