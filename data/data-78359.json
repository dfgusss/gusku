At the suggestion of a co-worker, he goes out into the night to find a prostitute for \"The Girlfriend Experience.\" He meets Christa, a streetwise call girl who's happy to fulfill his needs, and something unexpected happens. What starts as a business agreement blossoms into true love. But what happens when death enters the picture? How far would you go to keep the one person you've always wanted?"
