    "overview": "A woman and her 14-year-old daughter, who is a sleepwalker, in the midst of awakening. A marriage on the edges of a silenced crisis. A ritualistic, matriarchal, and endogamous family. Grandmother, siblings, cousins. A new summer, sweat, alcohol, traditions. Naked bodies, changing bodies, and the gazes upon those emerging bodies. A new New Year's celebration in the old historic family mansion is the trap for the sleepwalkers to finally awaken."
