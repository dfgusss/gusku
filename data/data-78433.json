    "overview": "This is the journey of five Dota players and a coach, who, just two months before, had never played together.  In 2018, OG were at rock-bottom, hit by painful departures and scrapping in qualifiers for Dota 2's TI8. Against the Odds is the fairytale of this broken team's shot at Gaming’s biggest prize."
