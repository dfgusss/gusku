    "overview": "A spirited artist with a mysterious bucket list gets a commission to paint a mural on a new hospital wing in a charming community. When she finds herself falling for the handsome architect designing the addition, she must decide if she can trust him with her list, and the painful memory behind it, or if he’ll break her heart and prove that it’s better to be alone than to be close to someone who will leave."
