    "overview": "In the near future, Manila is an almost-utopian city, but they still believe in ghost stories. Nobody survives the mysterious blackouts that happen in random parts of the city after midnight. Nobody believes the horrors in its darkness are even real. Four friends are about to find out that you don’t need to believe, for it to come for you."
