    "overview": "Three fraternal bank robbers, languishing in jail, discover a profitable (if not dodgy) way to spend their time. Crime can most certainly pay, if you \"know wot I mean?\" However when sex and greed rear-up between the good crims and the bad cops, the consequences are both bizarre and fatal."
