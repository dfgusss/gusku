However, this is the year it all flips around when she tries out and earns a uniform on the cheerleader squad lead by Ms. Flynn. Becky’s life is heading in the right direction when she catches the eye of the charming and handsome new student, Rob. Rob seems like the ideal boy, until his affection turns into obsession and he stops at nothing to keep Becky all to himself."
