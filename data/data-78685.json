Her journey to the college drives Nazli away from the village she has grown up - but years later, she wants to go back to the village where she was born, back to her mother - after all those years passed by with tons of \"I wish\". Candan Ercetin performed her song \"Annem - Mom\" once again for the movie twenty years later."
