    "overview": "Outside Wall Street, who knows BlackRock, the most powerful asset manager on the planet? Investigation of a discreet but influential actor in world economic and political life.  If money does not make you happy, it undoubtedly opens the doors of power. A maxim that the asset management group BlackRock, with its 6,000 billion US dollars spent, or more than twice the GDP of France, knows well. Companies, governments and central banks: the sprawling business has been expanding its influence in all directions, since its creation in 1988 by Larry Fink. The strength of this American management giant lies in the billions of dollars entrusted to it by its clients, most of whom are big fish in finance: multinationals, financial institutions and investment and pension funds."
