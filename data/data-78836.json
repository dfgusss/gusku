    "overview": "Angad Singh Ranyal is filmy, not the type to hold his belt buckle and dance at every Salman Khan song, rather the type who likes to watch their movie in peace. The stand-up special has observational humor and storytelling with a sprinkle of filmy-ness. Hopefully by the end of the show, you too will say- Angad, you are Kaafi Funny."
