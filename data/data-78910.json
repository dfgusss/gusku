    "overview": "Gergő and his high-school friends, the “Pack”, live for sex, parties and racking up views on their online channel. As their videos grow increasingly extreme, a house party turns tragic when they single out Lilla as their next victim. In a single night, their reckless game shatters the illusion of invulnerability in Budapest’s youth scene."
