The only memory of his past as a DJ in Beijing is the inspiring sophisticated electro music he plays in his car when he drives. One night, Naomi, a troubling and stunning escort and stripper, gets in his car. Intrigued by the young driver, falling for his music, she decides to make him her exclusive driver. But as they grow closer, Jin will have to betray dangerous people."
