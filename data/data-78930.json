    "overview": "On her 18th birthday, headstrong and artistic Charlie makes a startling discovery—the man married to her mother, isn't her father. Recruiting Oz, a rough sleeper whose only possession is his driving licence, she embarks on an epic road trip from Margate to the Isle of Skye to track down her biological father. On the journey they both learn more than they bargained for."
