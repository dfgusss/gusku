    "overview": "Six months after a car accident that cost her her parents, Cleo is finally starting to feel the same way before. She lives with her seven-year-old brother Bruno at her grandmother's house and is ready to return to her favorite activity – drinking parties with friends at Club No. 7.  When she gets into a fight in a bar, she is given a helping hand by the reclusive Leos. Despite the ten-year age difference, they become friends, and Cleo naively hopes that there will be something more between them."
