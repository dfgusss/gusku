    "overview": "Making a living from selling cheap wedding supplies doesn't free Fong from pressure to marry. She's been pushed beyond limits by unaffordable housing, archaic customs, and intrusive in-laws since engagement. More worrying is the comeback of a mainlander she's supposed to divorce out of a sham marriage."
