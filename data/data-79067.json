    "overview": "Prahastha, a lonely astronaut, works in a spaceship. Every morning, his spaceship comes close to Earth and Cargos are delivered at the arrival bay. These Cargos are people who have just died on Earth and we learn that Prahastha works for Post Death Transition Services — a large, pioneering, bureaucratic company that stores, transitions, and recycles dead people for rebirth. Today, after many years, a young, popular astronaut — Yuvishka, trained in cutting edge technology, will join the spaceship as his assistant."
