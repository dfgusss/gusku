Since Tusker was diagnosed with early-onset dementia two years ago, their time together is the most important thing they have.  As the trip progresses, however, their ideas for the future clash, secrets come out, and their love for each other is tested as never before. Ultimately, they must confront the question of what it means to love one another in the face of Tusker’s illness."
