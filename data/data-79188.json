In the age of technology, people are used to rushing, running, making money, while forgetting about the main thing - about themselves and their true desires. It seems to us that we will become happier as soon as we have a new car or a high salary. And everything is much simpler - the secret of happiness is hidden in the soul of every person: in the ability to believe in miracles, make friends, love, be courageous, follow your dream!"
