Nate will collide with his spitfire cousin-with-a-grudge (Jenni-Kate Deshon) he forced to run the factory when he left years before, a labor-strike lead by a high school wrestling buddy (Austin St. John), and a legal battle over the factory sale - brought on by the girl he left behind, Grace (Ashley Bratcher). Forced to search his soul and embrace his past, in rediscovering with his home town Nate just might reconnect - with his Grace."
