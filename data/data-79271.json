    "overview": "Director Olga Malirova Spatova's feature documentary authentically portrays Karel Gott as a phenomenal singer who gives his all to his fans, as a painter, but also as a loving husband and father. A man who was spreading joy with his songs for sixty years, among several generations not only here, but also in Europe, and even worldwide. The singer traces the steps of his life, allows viewers to peek behind the scenes of concerts, and shows also his family life and privacy that he otherwise tries to lovingly and humbly protect."
