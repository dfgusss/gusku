However, it soon turns out that there is nothing to pay for it. Now, in order not to stay on the street, the Frolovs do anything. To live a week with the whole family for 200 rubles? Easy! Play a classical concert dressed as an octopus? No problem! Become a social media star? You can also be a star. The Frolovs' monetary adventures turn into a comedy course in financial literacy for all Russian families."
