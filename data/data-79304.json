    "overview": "In this short lyrical film, haunting childhood memories, photographs and family stories form the heart of a woman's search for transformation. A descent into the labyrinths of memory, the film documents Jelena's recollections of her childhood in both Croatia and Canada, resulting in a fragmentary reconstruction of her past. With candour and sensitivity, Jelena reclaims her own identity, disarming us with her courage and will."
