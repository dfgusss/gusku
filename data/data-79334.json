    "overview": "Based on a story by H.C. Andersen, with new magical heroes, terrifying “woodpunk” robot dogs, real puppet theater, songs & dance numbers. Little Hans, a kind itinerant storyteller, opens his magic box, takes out his puppets, and, together with his spectators, creates a new fairytale. But not every character obeys the puppet master’s strings. The truth of the fairytale breaks everyday rules: here loyalty and friendship make miracles; love destroys the strongest magic spells; and a song wins a war!"
