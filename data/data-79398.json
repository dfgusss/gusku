    "overview": "Documenting the Witch Path is a documentary film that is testing the limits of three young documentary filmmakers. They find out about a place called the Witch Path that leads out to the lake known as the Witch Lake. It's where they drowned innocent women in the 17th century because they were accused of witchery. All because the people blindly listened to the priests. Nowadays, the path and the lake is closed off by the township. No one wants to answer why, but these filmmakers will find out the horrifying truth about it."
