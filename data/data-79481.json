    "overview": "Vincenzo dedicates his life to the bookshop he owns in Paris and to his daughter Albertine, forced to stay home because of an accident occurred to her a few years earlier. One day Yolande, an exuberant, eccentric, funny and beautiful girl, bursts into Vincenzo’s shop. Charmed by her vital energy, the man starts feeling again emotions he’s been chocking-off for too long, and which will make him question his melancholic and somehow suspended way of facing life."
