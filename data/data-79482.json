    "overview": "A young girl, recently married, is traveling from Aidini to Greece with her mother and her two daughters. On board the ship she decides not to let life pass her by, but to live her own way. And she goes ahead! She writes endlessly wherever she can, on napkins and cigarette boxes, to bills. She smokes, she passionately falls in love, casually gambles in luxurious salons, but also in illegal basements. A teacher who becomes an actress and plays in streets and in theaters, a poet who becomes the greatest Greek folk songwriter. She collaborates with all the famous music personalities of the country, from Vassilis Tsitsanis and Apostolos Kaldaras to Manolis Ηiotis, Antonis Repanis and Manos Hadjidakis, bravely asserting herself to a cruel and typically male-dominated world."
