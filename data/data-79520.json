    "overview": "Dropped into a web of family, sexual, political and romantic relationships where nothing is quite what it seems. One event leads to something else, people appear in one situation and reappear in another and by the end the lives of 22 people intersect in unpredictable ways during a 90-minute period on one magical night in the city they share."
