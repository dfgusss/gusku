    "overview": "Ancient literature has referred to the sound of hell as \"the wailing and gnashing of teeth.\"  Many people believe that may be the explanation behind a paranormal phenomenon that has been heard around the world. Camille Williams (Suziey Block) believes this haunting sound is responsible for the disappearance of her parents when she was a young girl. Now a grown woman, Camille sets out with her friend James (Clinton Roper Elledge) to hopefully find some answers."
