    "overview": "In Event of Moon Disaster illustrates the possibilities of deepfake technologies by reimagining this seminal event.\r\n What if the Apollo 11 mission had gone wrong and the astronauts had not been able to return home? A contingency speech for this possibility was prepared, but never delivered by President Nixon – until now. The immersive installation invites you into this alternative history and asks us all to consider how new technologies can bend, redirect and obfuscate the truth around us."
