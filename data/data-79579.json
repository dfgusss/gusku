    "overview": "David Samaras, \"el Griego\", is the general producer of the popular talk show \"Hoy se arregla el mundo\", where supposedly ordinary people resolve relationship, couple, friendship, work, parent and child conflicts. The most enduring bond in his life is Benito, his 9-year-old son, the fruit of a casual relationship. The story changes completely when he learns that Benito is not his son. The search for the real dad will lead them to a crossroads much bigger than the one they set out to face."
