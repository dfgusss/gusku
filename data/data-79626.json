    "overview": "It's been a long time since Caine, Bronson, Angus and Wendell—aka ‘The Chain Breakers'—escaped a torturous Vietnamese POW camp. They now find themselves sharing a new prison, The Hogan Hills Retirement Home for Returned Veterans. Each of the boys has an unrealised dream they want to achieve, so they band together to devise a plan to escape their new hell. But the rules of engagement have changed. In fact, they can’t even remember what they were—and that’s half the problem."
