    "overview": "Anne Walberg is a celebrity in the world of perfume.  She creates fragrances and sells her incredible talent to companies of all kinds.  She lives as a diva, selfish, with a strong temper.  Guillaume is her new driver and the only one who is not afraid to stand up to her.  No doubt this is the reason why she does not fire him."
