It has an exceptional life-span of 30 years, but what's the secret behind this record-breaking longevity? In this film, a 777 is taken apart, inspected, and entirely refurbished. This incredible operation is carried out every 16 years so the aircraft can remain at the cutting edge of technology, comfort, and safety."
