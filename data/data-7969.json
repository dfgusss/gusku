    "overview": "Somewhere in New Jersey, a group of masked rollerblading children \"save the universe\" by training to fight the evil Cobra Khan through a series of action-packed montages.  Along the way they hypothesize some slapstick hijinks in a balloon factory, and save the day through a hypothetical Sonic Virtual Reality battle.  A real treat!"
