    "overview": "Stephanie, a restless and vibrant actress, meets Gerard, an NYPD counter-terrorism specialist who’s an aficionado of experimental theater (and maybe out of his mind). Flirtation ensues, ends disastrously, and forces Stephanie to the ramshackle home of musician Eleanor Friedberger, a supposed escape infected by violent memories of her past life."
