    "overview": "Faced with the trials and obstacles of life, the tight-knit community of Ste-Adeline has always remained united. But this time it's in shock and will have to face a situation that will confront the inhabitants with their contradictions. At the center of the scandal, Magalie, a teenager with a childish pout, Manuel, the adopted child of the village's emblematic mayor, and Isabelle and Chantale, protective mothers but powerless witnesses to a predicted tragedy. In Ste-Adeline, appearances are deceptive and the layers of a carefully maintained social veneer end up cracking, revealing the true nature of the inhabitants of this peaceful little town."
