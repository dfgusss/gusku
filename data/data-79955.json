    "overview": "Chhalaang humorously addresses the value of Sports Education in the school curriculum. It follows a hilarious, yet an inspirational journey of a typical PT Master from a semi government-funded school in Northern India, Montu, for whom it’s just a job and is forced to do what he has never done - Teach."
