He transports passengers through the road which has been destroyed by flood on his motor bike when he meets a young girl who's the new teacher of the village school and falls in love with her. A love so pure that ends in driving him crazy and it seems like only a miracle can save him. \"God is Close\" is Vazirian's first feature film and it is about love from a spiritual point of view which ends to a miraculous experience."
