    "overview": "Villa Empain was conceived by a Belgian philanthropist as his private home. After its completion in 1934, Louis Empain donated the property to the state. Since then, the exquisite building has served as a Soviet embassy, a TV studio, etc. Only since 2008 does it fulfil its original destination: a haven for art."
