    "overview": "Best friends for life, Jane and Fiona have done everything together since kindergarten – Jane following wherever Fiona will lead. Left devastated and adrift following Fiona’s sudden suicide, Jane’s only way to make sense of everything is by helping Fiona’s widow Gemma care for their young son Bailey. Polar-opposites, the two women have nothing in common save for their shared grief and love for Fiona."
