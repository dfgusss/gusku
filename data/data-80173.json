    "overview": "A contemplative odyssey across our planet, looking at the simple and extraordinary ways that dogs influence our daily lives.  Former child soldiers in Uganda. The local pub in a Scottish town. A dog walker on the streets of Istanbul. A kaleidoscope of unconventional portraits from fascinating locations.  People need dogs, and perhaps they need us, but what do humans do to deserve the unconditional love they provide?"
