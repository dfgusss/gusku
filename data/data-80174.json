    "overview": "Melanie (Leslie Hope) has a good, solid life, but when she’s diagnosed with cancer, her world spirals out of control. Instead of confronting her disease, she leaves her husband (Bruce Greenwood) and heads out for a bender while searching for the meaning of life. During her trip she meets a mysterious, erotic photographer (Jeff Kober) and agrees to throw caution to the wind and pose for him. This opens up dangerous choices revealed in a surprising show that ignites passionate, provocative emotions and incendiary repercussions through not only her life, but her friends and family."
