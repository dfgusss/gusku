    "overview": "Four short stories are set along the roads of Donbass during the war. There are no safe spaces and no one can make sense of just what is going on.  Even as they are trapped in the chaos, some manage to wield authority over others. But in this world, where tomorrow may never come, not everyone is defenseless and miserable. Even the most innocent victims may have their turn at taking charge."
