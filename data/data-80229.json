    "overview": "The relationship between two neighboring farm families are strained when one of them chooses to lease their land to an oil and gas company. In the midst of growing tension, the land is drilled, and something long dormant and terrifying, deep beneath the earth's surface is released. \"Unearth\" is about the horrifying repercussions sown by short-sighted decisions, and what our children reap from our actions."
