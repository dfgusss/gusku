    "overview": "Spain, 1970s. While a cruel dictatorship rules an eternally grey country through fear, violence, repression and censorship, María, a young dancer, dreams of bringing bright colours into her life and the lives of others, as she makes her way towards personal freedom and pursues her crazy dream of becoming a TV star; a very funny journey in which she will be comforted by the pop songs of the incomparable Italian singer and dancer Raffaella Carrà."
