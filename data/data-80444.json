    "overview": "Dr. Miami (a.k.a. Michael Salzhauer) is the most famous surgeon in America. Millions of loyal followers from around the world tune in daily as he live streams graphic plastic surgery procedures on social media - all with the enthusiastic consent of his self-proclaimed \"beauty warrior\" patients. Celebrated for his outrageous social media persona and boasting a patient waiting list that's two years long, his private life is quite different than one may expect. After he leaves a lively day's work of Brazilian butt lifts, breast augmentations and choreographed snapchat videos, he's a devoted husband, father to five children and an Orthodox Jew who observes the Sabbath."
