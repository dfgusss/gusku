Their mission is to save the explorer Beanka, who has mysteriously disappeared and seems to be a longlost friend of Skalmans. They do not realize that they have a follower though; a smug cat named Kattja. She is determined to get to their destination - what she believes is a treasure - first. Their expedition include being chased by wolves, spending a night at a spooky hotel, climbing a volcano and finally, maybe finding what they all are searching for. However, the treasure is not always what it seems to be."
