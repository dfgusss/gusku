    "overview": "Life surprises you with its weird plans and events which changes our lives so much so that we can never go back to being what we were earlier. At such times we have to rise against the wind just like a kite does. It is the same with the story of Gaalipata 2. Its story is set in two different time zones, in two different places but with the same characters. It's about a turbulent yet fun filled journey of three friends and their love interests."
