    "overview": "Andreea Raducan, a successful 32-year-old woman and one of Romania’s greatest gymnasts, sacrificed her childhood to become an Olympic champion. She finally won the all-round Olympic gold medal in Sydney in 2000, but was stripped of it three days later after testing positive for a doping substance contained in a flu tablet her doctor had administered to her minutes before she entered the competition. Fifteen years later, Andreea is fighting the toughest fight against the people who deceived her, as she tries to recover her medal and, along with it, her dignity."
