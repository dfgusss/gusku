    "overview": "After losing her laundry store to a fire incident, a single mom Duk-hee receives a call from a bank offering a generous upfront loan so she takes it right away. But soon after, she finds out that she has become a victim of a voice phishing scheme. Devastated, Duk-hee turns to the police for help, only to be more disappointed that there is no hope of retrieving her money. At the moment of despair, Jae-min, the phisher who tricked her, rings her phone once again to tip Duk-hee off about the criminal organization that locked him up and coerced him to make voice phishing calls from China. With that call, Duk-hee makes up her mind to investigate this case for herself and take a plane to China with her friends."
