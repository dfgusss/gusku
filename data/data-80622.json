    "overview": "The world had changed. Streets day by day were filled with protest. The unemployed. The lost. Chaos. Then something happened. Something though it had no name had arrived. Fear. Fear over took rationale. The streets became empty. The new age of reliance had begun. The reliance on power. The reliance on comfort. On certainty. Something had happened. But nobody knew what. Until now."
