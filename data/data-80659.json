    "overview": "Lifelong pranksters who once left summer camps in flames and terrified counselors, a group of old friends - now all but Marcell, the wealthy but unhappy engineer - plots a daring art heist: sneak a bizarre painting into the century’s biggest auction. They even rope in their estranged buddy and a professional thief, but their “perfect” plan quickly unravels into chaos, wild adventures and plenty of frog–eating mayhem, which suits them just fine."
