    "overview": "Crime and Punishment set in Turkey. Bilal worked as a torturer for the military regime in the 1980s that murdered Selman's sons. Selman now has a gun on Bilal in a cave. Both men are trapped by their primitive instincts. The interplay of light and dark dissolves the boundary between perpetrator and victim."
