    "overview": "Four childhood friends and their wives at an upscale dinner party. After a much-heated discussion about how smartphones influence their personal lives, the group proposes a late-night game:  everyone is to place their mobiles on the table; whoever gets a text, notification or call must share it with the group. It is a recipe for disaster."
