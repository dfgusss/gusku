    "overview": "An electronics store erupts into chaos as four young Vietnamese gunmen storm the premises, setting the stage for the largest hostage situation in US history. Rick Gomez, SAC PD's top hostage negotiator, quickly realizes that his job is not simply to talk down the gunman and keep everyone safe, but must also juggle the politics of an arrogant sheriff and a trigger-happy SWAT commander to prevent a national tragedy."
