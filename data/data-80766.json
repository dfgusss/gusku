    "overview": "Documentary film contrasting the experiences of two high-school seniors, basketball players from remarkably different backgrounds.  Brian Walker is taken from his close-knit Indiana family, living in a small town. In contrast, Stretch Graham has practically no family support, and looks to his Brooklyn team and his warm-hearted coach for support. Both are actively being recruited by colleges."
