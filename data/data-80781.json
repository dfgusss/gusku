    "overview": "It's Friday night and five friends on the cusp of adulthood gather at a house to celebrate the end of another school week. They drink. They flirt. They laugh. They shoot the breeze. As the night grows later, the teens reach a state of alcohol-induced openness. They reveal secrets, crushes and an unintentionally cruel streak."
