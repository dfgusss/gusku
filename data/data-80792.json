    "overview": "Beautiful, ruthlessly ambitious, intelligent, and successful businesswoman Catherine Black lives a life of luxury in an architectural dream house in Malibu with exclusive designer fashions, fast cars, and exquisite jewelry. She has no need for a man except to satisfy her natural serial killer instinct, literally. When Tyler, a petty thief, responds to her online roommate ad, he thinks he's struck gold. But he has no idea that after a night of partying and passion, he is really just on her menu to be her next victim… until real romance gets in the way."
