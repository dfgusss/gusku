    "overview": "Rosa (Rosa Forlano), a 90-year-old Nonna, falls in love with a Robot while teaching it how to make spaghetti. Unfortunately, her family recipe is erased by a software update. TOTO is a sincere ode to traditions like Rosa’s—who’s also the real-life Nonna of filmmaker Marco Baldonado—while also a warning signal to hold them close in times to come."
