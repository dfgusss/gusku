    "overview": "Frantisek Soukenický is a psychiatrist with an apparent life in order ... until the appearance of a former lover scorned. She ends her career and Frantisek ends without a job, his wife (who left him for another man) and homeless. He doesn´t have choice but to start from scratch, and know that everything that happened was his fault. Abandonment, reunions, commitment and the suffering caused certain relationships when they reach their final part of this film that combines drama with dry humor."
