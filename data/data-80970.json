    "overview": "In \"Ape Canyon\" a lone Bigfoot (North America's Greatest Lover) roams the forests of the Pacific Northwest. He brings his gift of Red Hot Sasquatch Love to nature-loving ladies everywhere, whether they're hugging trees or simply camping and hiking. Bored waitress Darcy (Clover Lutter) had one unforgettable encounter and now she wants more. Night and day, she combs the woods for Bigfoot, calling to him, reciting love poems, and yearning for the wild, hairy touch of the beast who can satisfy her better than any man. Darcy's jealous husband Bill (Chris Henry) is also hot on the trail of Sasquatch, but he's coming with guns blazing. Time is running out for Bigfoot. Will Darcy win his heart before it's too late- or will the consequences of his untamed libido bring his wild ways to an explosive end?"
