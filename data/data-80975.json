    "overview": "Pandora's Box unmasks the global pandemic of menstrual inequity and period poverty. From Maasai villages, to Mumbai and on to London, we meet young women who are forced to stay at home from school, or even drop out, merely because they don't have access to menstrual supplies. We meet formerly incarcerated women in the U.S. prison system who talk about their struggles to menstruate safely while deprived of basic human hygiene. One of them asks: \"Isn't the ability to menstruate with dignity a basic human right?\""
