    "overview": "Jiwon, a motivated new police officer, is strangely bothered after meeting Osun, a social worker. On a hot summer day, a kidnapper sends a message saying, ‘If you want to save the kidnapped child, donate money to the welfare center.’ The incident becomes a national concern as the media report it. Somehow, Jiwon doubts the link between the case and Osun."
