    "overview": "Jaakko and Sirpa have never met face to face, but talk on the phone every day. When Jaakko hears news about Sirpa's declining health, he decides to go meet her in another city. It's not the easiest decision, because he's blind and paralyzed from the chest down  - and he has to make the journey alone. To get there, Jaakko must rely on the help of five strangers. What could go wrong?"
