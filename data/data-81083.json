    "overview": "Amina, Sami and Jennyfer are high school students in the Paris suburbs, in 93.  At the initiative of 3 of their teachers, they embark on an unexpected investigation into a gigantic leisure park project which involves concreting agricultural land near their homes.  But can we have the power to act on a territory when we are 17 years old?  Funny and intrepid, these new citizens take us to meet residents of their neighborhood, property developers, farmers and even elected officials of the National Assembly.  A joyful quest that challenges conventional wisdom and revives our connection to the land!"
