He worked in a bank first, but when the bank is not satisfied with Emre, the company assigns it to an empty plaza that has been idle for years. Emre is obliged to spend 12 hours in this 27-storey plaza in Istanbul, where there is no one else. In this plaza where there is no one, Emre will find himself in the unexpected events and a mixed love."
