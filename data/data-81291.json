    "overview": "Kristen and Hannah are best friends­–smart, likable and college-bound– and also addicted to heroin. The pair of seemingly unlikely addicts spiral down a path of destruction, hiding their secret from well-meaning but busy parents behind pink bedrooms and school uniforms, propelling their tight-knit community from disbelief to disaster to, ultimately, hope."
