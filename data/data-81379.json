    "overview": "Kolya is an ordinary guy: video games, rap and friends. The last thing he cares about is the future. Until one day, he gets into the future himself. And everything is not easy there. The Earth coalition won the intergalactic war and lives quite happily, only the leaders of the defeated pirate forces are secretly preparing a new offensive. To do so, they need to go back in time and change the course of history, and Kolya unwittingly becomes their tool. But most importantly, Kolya meets Alisa, a girl unlike anyone else."
