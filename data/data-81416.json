    "overview": "Surviving graduation is just the first challenge for Bray, Oliver, and Stacey, three friends determined to make it to the Summerland Music Festival, no matter what it takes. Embarking on a road-trip in high spirits, there’s more than just music waiting for them at the end of the rainbow. Bray has plans to meet Shawn, a boy he met on an online dating site he’s convinced is questioning his sexuality. The problem? He’s been pretending to be Stacey, Oliver’s girlfriend, to get close to him."
