    "overview": "Comedian Beth Stelling takes the stage at Minneapolis’ Varsity Theater to talk sex, drugs, and babies in her hilarious new special Beth Stelling: Girl Daddy. Musing on the ways that sexual pleasure is different for men and women, Stelling’s not ashamed to admit that she always thinks her massage therapist is falling for her – and is not afraid to call male comedians out for making lazy #MeToo jokes. Stelling also shares her takes on being a relationship person, having reverse body dysmorphia, alternative wedding traditions, her relationship with her Orlando-based actor father whose personality is “Fox News,” talking sex with her may-as-well-be-virginal mom, and how her sisters just love to make babies."
