    "overview": "This engaging, long-unavailable documentary follows Phranc—a butch lesbian performer who rose to underground fame in LA’s punk scene before reinventing herself as “America’s favorite Jewish lesbian folk singer” and touring with acts like the Smiths and Hüsker Dü—as she embarks on her surprising new career: Tupperware saleswoman. Using her gregarious personality and performance experience, Phranc finds remarkable success and a newfound community hosting Tupperware parties, shooting straight to the top of the West Coast’s highest sellers. But what does it mean to be a gender-nonconforming queer woman in a business typically associated with the classic postwar suburban housewife? As the irrepressible Phranc herself puts it, “I can change closed minds just by showing up.”"
