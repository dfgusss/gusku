    "overview": "Like many young men in the Dominican Republic, 19-year-old Miguel \"Sugar\" Santos dreams of winning a slot on an American baseball team. Indeed, his talents as a pitcher eventually land him a slot on a single-A team in Iowa, but culture shock, racism and other curveballs threaten to turn Sugar's dream sour."
