    "overview": "A look at the story of Liverpool's quest to return to the top of English football by winning the Premier League. This is a revealing insight into why the club fell away after their domination of football in the 80s, inluding how the club's identity was shaped by both the tragedies of Heysel and Hillsborough, the struggle to keep up with the rapidly changing world of football, and the Jurgen Klopp revolution that has returned them back to the summit of the game."
