    "overview": "Anne falls in love with the Jewish doctor Daniel. Since he is not Jewish, he allows himself to be coached accordingly in order to keep up appearances. Every attempt by Daniel to clear up the misunderstanding achieves the opposite. Eventually he capitulates because he doesn't want to lose Anne. Tobias has to help him."
