    "overview": "One of the most popular TV shows \"\"Heads and Tails\"\" is on the verge of closure. Many presenters, directors, cameramen have left the project, and those who remain are not in the best shape. The atmosphere in the team has long lost its creative fuse, everyone is dissatisfied with something, and even the family, once ideal, couple of presenters remaining on the project demonstrates a discord in the family. In order to avoid collapse, the producer of the program will have to take a desperate step: Arrange the filming of the program in one of the most closed countries in the world."
