    "overview": "Christoph Pehofer took a nine-month journey through North America and Asia. Staying in hostels was a rare alternative. What he did instead was sleeping in complete strangers' living rooms - Couchsurfing. The main focus of the film is on the people which participate in Couchsurfing and their great diversity: from a young student, to a family, to a nudist in Manhattan and a transgender in Bangkok."
