    "overview": "Once a fragile ballerina Olya meets a rude and gloomy boxer Evgeny. The contrast between the worlds of the heroes and their worldview is so striking that the very possibility of intersection of heroes appears as a miracle. Are the heroes ready to accept the same timid feeling that arose between them? Will they overcome everything external and superficial, behind which fragile loving souls are hidden."
