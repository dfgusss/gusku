    "overview": "Nathan Holmes and his girlfriend Ashlee have the perfect life together - a storybook romance - but Nathan is a man possessed by intense and disturbing dreams. His psychiatrist, Dr. Cameron Graye, doesn't seem to be helping, and neither are Nathan's parents, who seem to be holding something back. As Nathan delves deeper into the unknown, he begins distancing himself from everyone, and as life continues to spiral out of control, the line between dreams and reality blurs and not even Nathan knows when he's awake or when he's dreaming."
