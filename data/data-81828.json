Hundreds of years into the future the human race fights for its survival against Illuminati forces. Following a prophecy, Trump's clone joins forces with the surviving human allies to bring the battle straight to the Illuminati headquarters in hell. But when Donald Trump meets Satan himself, he'll be in for the fight of his life."
