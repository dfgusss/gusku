María has been living there for decades after emigrating when she was young and Verónica is a young girl recently arrived in search of opportunities she never found in Spain. A strange friendship is forged between them and this leads María to set out on a return journey to the south of Spain with an unusual mission. What begins as a search for Verónica's roots will become an opportunity to open herself up to the world and question certain principles on which she had based her life."
