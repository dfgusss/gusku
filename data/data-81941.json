    "overview": "Rachel, a concerned researcher, and her team have set out to sea to prove that the disappearance of a family and crew from a merchant ship was for reasons having to do with the supernatural. Her theory that those on the Mary Celeste vanished into a \"rift\" between dimensions proves true as the boat breaks down and her crew begins to vanish one by one."
