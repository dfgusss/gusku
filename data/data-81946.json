Among the first curists, four overweight teenagers sent by the town hall; Marion and Lio, her skinny sister who imposes the cure on her \"for her own good\"; and their friend Émilie who, having shed her extra kilos, discovers as soon as she arrives that her beloved husband is swooning in the arms of a man... who is clearly overweight!"
