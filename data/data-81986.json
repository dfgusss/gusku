    "overview": "A group of hard-up low level criminals are sent into a giant abandoned school building to fetch stolen goods for the local kingpin. Unfortunately for them, the building is inhabited by the unhinged caretaker Joe and his super strong man-child bodyguard Sunny. One by one the criminals are picked off in increasingly grotesque ways. Heads roll, blood splatters, and gore slops as Sunny tears through the gang like tissue paper. Who will survive and what will be left of them?"
