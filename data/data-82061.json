    "overview": "The silver spoon masterfully escapes from prison and starts a new life. New sweet life! Sokolovsky joins the secular crowd, where everyone is sitting on a new synthetic drug, and he is again surrounded by cars, villas and top models. Friends, enemies and the FSB are following the trail of the silver spoon, trying to understand what game he has started and on whose side he is. Igor is trying to understand who he is - a traitor, a saint or is it the same ... silver spoon?"
