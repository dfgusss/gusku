    "overview": "Past and present collide when aimless slacker Hannah gets hired to portray Lady Wadsworth -- a Southern belle from the 1800s -- for tours at Wadsworth Manor. Hannah figures she can fake it well enough, until the ghost of Lady Wadsworth appears and tells her it's time to change her wild ways -- or she'll haunt her forever."
