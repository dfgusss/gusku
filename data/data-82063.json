    "overview": "A Stranger (30s) hikes out of town and into the forest. He sets up camp for the night. He hears a deep howling, peeks his head out the tent and gets attacked -- leaving him unconscious. An anonymous Man (25) drags his body to a house, which is nestled in a place that time has somehow forgotten. The injured Stranger awakens in a bed as a Woman (35) nurses him back to health. This Man and Woman play a game with this Stranger, a game that pushes him to the brink of madness."
