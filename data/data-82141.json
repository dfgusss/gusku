    "overview": "When Maria thinks she's at the bottom of the barrel, she discovers that this barrel has a double bottom: no job, no money, no worthy accomplishment and now a dying mother begging her to do something with her life.  before his death!  She has no other choice but to get back in hand and find a career ... But what can she do with a 7-year-old BAC in communication and no work experience?  Believe it or not, she can become a substitute in a high school!  Thus, Maria, 30, as responsible and stable as a 14-year-old teenager, returns to high school in the role of the one to whom she threw pieces of erasers: the replacement.  Too jaded teachers, rebellious teenagers, intimidated or not sufficiently denounced, she will be confronted with the reality of teachers and young people today and, who knows, may discover a vocation."
