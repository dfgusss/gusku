    "overview": "In 1988, in Saint-Élie-de-Caxton, an 11-years-old boy is worried for his grandmother's life. Worn out by illness, the old storyteller tries to convince her grandson that Death no longer exists. Her story will bring back to life the extraordinary people from the village in 1927 who, by using rocambolesque tricks, will eliminate Death that threatens them. From now on, Death will coincide with the birth of legends."
