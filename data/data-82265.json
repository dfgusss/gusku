    "overview": "\"To make the film Goddaddy was a great challenge, because it covers almost forty years of Milan Bandić's activity, a seemingly hyperactive and Trump-like character of the Croatian political scene. Bandić has been elected six times as the mayor of Zagreb, which is not only the capital city of all Croats, but also the capital city of all Croatian criminals. Three times Milan Bandić has rejected to give us an interview for the film, so we made an audition to find him a double.\" - Dario Juričan"
