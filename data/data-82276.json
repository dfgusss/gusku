She has just moved to Las Arboledas after the separation of her parents and spends her days in the boring company of her younger sister. The monotony disappears when she meets Eva, a girl with a rebellious attitude with whom she will discover love and the disappointments that accompanies it, a turbulent journey full of assaults, illusions and rock and roll."
