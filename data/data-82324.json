    "overview": "Giacomo, the main character, 35 years of laziness, is a man who doesn't know and doesn't want to fight. He is a introvert curmudgeon, a little bit nerd but not very social, who walks with the look downward on his device without giving to the people what they would like from him: only a little bit of attention and enthusiasm. He loses his job, he is left by his wife and coincidentally he remains closed in the women's bathroom of the art-house cinema, together with the owner's small dog."
