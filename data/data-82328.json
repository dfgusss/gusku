    "overview": "As Shannon, a woman who wants to put her father's ashes away in the woods witnesses a corrupt cop dealing drugs with a junkie, she has to try and run away after she gets rampaged by two discreditable cops after they see her taking secret photographs of their crime maneuver. They then do a cat-and-mouse game around the woods as Shannon teams up with a retired sheriff along the way for more reinforcement. It's just a diversion of survival and egalitarianism."
