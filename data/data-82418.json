Y2KILL has assembled a team of horror legends including Kane Hodder, Bill Moseley, and Scream Queen Linnea Quigley for five terrifying segments each more deadly than the last! All of this murderous mayhem is hosted by the Temptress of Terror but she better watch out, because the vengeful Mistress of Midnight is out to prove that she's still the most hellish host around."
