    "overview": "People who are very different in social origin, material capabilities, occupation and outlook on life are involved in a curious situation. Wealthy businessman Igor and his girlfriend Olga - a socialite who dreams of a career as a designer; tired from work as a physiotherapist Andrey and his wife, a pharmacist, Irina. The thrill seeking in one case and the desire to find a way out of the family dead end in the other lead these couples to a New Year's Eve swinger party. A sexual experiment in both couples, initiated by only one of the partners, turns into a series of incidents and ends in failure. To the surprise of themselves and their \"legitimate\" halves, the heroes reveal real feelings and strong mutual affection."
