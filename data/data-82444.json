    "overview": "Treyvon has everything, well almost everything. He's got the fast car, good city job, model looks - even a good sense of humor, and yep - a body to die for. The only thing missing is that one special somebody. Ever since he embarrassed a young woman who asked him for a date, his love life has been cursed. Now, over 15 years later, he is trying to break the spell."
