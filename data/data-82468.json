    "overview": "On a lark, Zoey rents a food truck and enters a reality TV competition. Heat rises between her and the handsome founder of a fast food chain, but when Zoey finds out he’s a judge in the contest, things quickly fizzle. Zoey’s determined to win fair and square and she suspects ‘Mr-Too-Good-To-Be-True’ is really after her sauce recipe, not her heart."
