    "overview": "Pothuraju Veera Shankar is a hot-headed circle inspector from Andhra who doesn’t like to hear the word ‘background’. Wherever he is appointed in the state, he brings all the notorious gundas to their knees with his signature policing style. When Shankar is appointed in Ongole, the brutal Katari commits a spine-chilling murder and angers Shankar. How the rivalry between Pothuraju Veera Shankar and Katari turns worse is what Krack is all about."
