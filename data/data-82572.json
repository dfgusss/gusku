With the combination of her new skills and natural talent for social media, Ozi soon has a worldwide following. When she learns that her parents might be alive, Ozi sets off on a quest to find them and to tell the world what is happening to the rainforest before it’s too late. With help from new friends, cheeky monkey Chance and loveable rhino Honkus, Ozi discovers that one voice really can change the world."
