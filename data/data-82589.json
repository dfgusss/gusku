    "overview": "Tonino Esposito is the son of the fearsome Camorra boss of Rione Sanità, Naples. Unlike him, however, Tonino is clumsy and utterly innocuous—a decent person at heart—and so when his father dies he's passed over in matters of succession. His pride wounded, he doesn't resign himself and tries to be his own boss, only managing to make a fool of himself. When he finds out that his daughter is dating to the son of the judge prosecuting the new boss, Tonino sees the opportunity to prove himself in front of his family and all of Naples."
