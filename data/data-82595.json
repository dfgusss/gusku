In her desperation, she seduces a drug addict into a dark ritual. Suddenly her luck changes and she lands a talent agent who wants her to expand her social media following and transition her into film and television. All seems to be going well until the disturbing visions she's struggled with since childhood return, forcing her down an even darker path. Can Savanna's luck continue or will her past catch up to her and destroy her dream of success?"
