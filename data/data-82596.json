    "overview": "Marika has terminal cancer, with a stomach full of tumors. It’s been 10 months since she was told she has two months to live. Her first goal was to finish the season of Game of Thrones, then to make it to her next birthday. Now at her 50th birthday celebrations, easy discussion revolves around what her next goal might be, and whether or not she should have an open coffin at her funeral. The atmosphere is the opposite of morose, as everyone is laughing and at ease."
