    "overview": "In the north of the Iberian Peninsula, we find two regions that will provide us with great moments. These are the Basque Country and Navarre, two territories that are home to a high percentage of Europe's biodiversity. At Natura Bizia, we will reveal the best-preserved corners, the most spectacular biodiversity, and animal fauna in its wildest state. Vertical cliffs, an endless sea, magical forests, and enormous limestone mountains will provide us with unforgettable experiences. We will swim among the largest cetaceans on the planet, enjoy the first steps of the brown bear after its winter hibernation, witness the daily struggle of wolves to conquer new territory, and fly alongside the most powerful of our eagles."
