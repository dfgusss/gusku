    "overview": "Alice and Tommaso have been together for fifteen years; they don’t have children, he‘s a musician, she’s an actress. Invited to dinner for an announcement, their friends think it’s going to be a marriage announcement, but instead discover that decided to break up: but without drama or emotional rifts, staying friends with each other. A legitimate but naive ambition. Love stories end, because people change. And no change is, nor can it be, painless."
