    "overview": "Four travellers meet in Madrid’s city centre through a rideshare app. Four individuals who could never imagine the journey they are about to embark on, as they gradually exchange secrets, emotions and mistrust, eventually arriving at a very different destination to the one they had planned. Along the way, they will learn a lot about who they are travelling with... and about themselves."
