    "overview": "An urban legend says that lighting fireworks at an abandoned airfield will beckon the \"summer ghost,\" a spirit that can answer any question. Three teenagers, Tomoya, Aoi, and Ryo, each have their own reason to show up one day. When a ghost named Ayane appears, she reveals she is only visible to those \"who are about to touch their death.\" Compelled by the ghost and her message, Tomoya begins regularly visiting the airfield to uncover the true purpose of her visits."
