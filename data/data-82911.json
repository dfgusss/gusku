Faced with growing doubts about himself, his purpose, and his belief in God, Joe is stunned when he receives a message from God on his computer screen telling him that he’s been chosen to inspire the world and play in a world championship golf tournament. Guided by God’s eccentric personal messenger, Herb, Joe learns that the seemingly impossible is possible…through faith, family, and second chances."
