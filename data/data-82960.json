    "overview": "At 12 years old, Carrie Watson places a piece of wedding cake under her pillow when her mother tells her about the superstition that doing so will ensure you dream of your future true love -- and that night, Carrie dreams of a handsome man meeting her at the altar. Fast forward a couple decades, and Carrie, now a successful chemist (and amateur baker), is prepping the wedding cakes for her little sister, Lydia's wedding. Carrie is shocked to discover that the groom's best man, Jason, is the very same man from her wedding cake dream."
