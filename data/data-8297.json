    "overview": "Reunited for their mother’s funeral, four sisters – Selma, Regina, Laura and Lúcia – find themselves forced to divide much more than an apartment in Copacabana. While dividing the articles,  the sisters compare options, destinies, lifestyles, and expectations. The turbulent sale of the apartment represents a turning point in their lives: they know they have never been so deeply involved as accomplices, or as sisters."
