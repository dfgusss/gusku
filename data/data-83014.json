    "overview": "Over time and during conquest, \"comida casera,\" home cooking of Texas Mexican families sustained indigenous identity and memory. Cooking deer, cactus and tortillas, women led the cultural resistance against colonization. This road movie weaves through Texas cities, names the racism that erased Native American history. It celebrates a new type of encounter, one with a table where All are welcome."
