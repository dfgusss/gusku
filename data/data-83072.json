In her opinion, the best way to destroy her mother's extramarital affair and bring her parents back together is a teenage daughter in trouble. Thus, Eveliina gets herself in trouble as many ways as she can. Along the way, the lives of a few others are at stake. Still, Eveliina guards her plan to the last, and the adults have their own secret ways of survival - until the bubble bursts."
