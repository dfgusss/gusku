    "overview": "At the age of 20, Burton Barr Jr. was held down by a group of friends while they injected heroin into his veins, which started his 22-year drug addiction. At the height of his addiction and during his darkest hour, his father came to him. He didn't start preaching at Barr, telling him that he needed to quit. He didn't talk about the hurt and the pain that Barr was causing his family. He didn't even tell Barr about the damage that he was doing to himself. He just opened the Bible to a certain scripture, gave it to Barr and told him to read that scripture every morning before he left home. The scripture was Psalms 121. 121 details how Burton Barr Jr. overcame his addiction to heroin, cocaine, crack, alcohol, cigarettes and sex by learning to harness the power and live out the words of the 121st Psalm."
