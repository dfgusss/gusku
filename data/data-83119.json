    "overview": "They are very different, but they have one dream - to reach heaven. The famous Moscow stand-up comedian Ilya Pogorelov was publicly accused of lying by his ex, and now he needs to \"just\" survive. And the shy provincial Sanyok wants to break out of his cocoon and live for real at least a little. By chance (or providence), Sanyok and Ilya set off together on a journey to the sea to find themselves, make their dreams come true and find love. The duet \"Pogorelov and Sanyok\" formed along the way will travel across the floor of Russia, blow up TikTok, make millions laugh and move - make hearts beat faster and remind you how to enjoy life."
