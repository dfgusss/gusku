    "overview": "Explores the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the unique perspective of the camera crews who risked their lives filming in the irradiated aftermath. Initially started by a Japanese newsreel crew, and then continued under the supervision of the US Army, this documentary reveals how their footage was seized, classified top secret, and then buried by American officials for decades in order to hide the full human cost of the bombings as a costly nuclear arms race began."
