    "overview": "Imagine a sprawling city of 155,000 retirees, equipped with 54 golf courses, 70 swimming pools, and its own media outlet. The thousands of residents of The Villages, Florida, live isolated from the world in a leisure bubble where age is no longer a question. But all of this comes at a cost, paid by the flora, fauna, and locals."
