    "overview": "HELLBOX is a paranoid supernatural thriller about a shadowy conspiracy against humanity that stretches across five centuries. It’s told through interweaving storylines in which assorted people (knights from a holy brotherhood, a group of college girls, a suicidal psychiatrist, and a haunted couple with their own dark secrets) see their lives horribly changed when they come into possession of an ancient, mysterious box… Some say it holds a piece of Hell."
