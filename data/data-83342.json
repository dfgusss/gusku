    "overview": "Aisha lives at a centre for asylum-seekers in Ireland in a state of ongoing uncertainty. Having fled Nigeria after a violent gang murdered members of her family, she is desperately trying to find some degree of permanency, where she and her mother can be reunited and live without fear. As she navigates the complex legal system to seek settlement in Ireland, she sparks an unlikely friendship with Conor, a new guard at the centre. A former prisoner, Conor’s life experience and calming presence resonate with Aisha, allowing for a tentative romance to begin. But the bond between the pair comes under strain as the threat of deportation looms ever larger."
