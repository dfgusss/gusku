    "overview": "Lennon exists timidly on the sidelines of the thriving Columbus indie music scene, yearning for a personal connection that might shepherd her into the cutting-edge art scene. Enter Bobbi Kitten, an enigmatic, striking and talented half of a popular indie pop duo, who takes Lennon under her confident wing—unwittingly entangling herself in a dark obsession."
