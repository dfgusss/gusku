    "overview": "As always, our beloved horse, Julius, is steeped in history. And at the same time he helped the Prince - they accidentally exchanged bodies, of course, not without the help of an old acquaintance - Baba Yaga and a little witchcraft. Now Julius is sitting in the palace and landscaping Kiev, and the Prince plows the field. These are the games of thrones. But this cannot go on for long, the fatherland is in danger! And as always, three heroes get down to business."
