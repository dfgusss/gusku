    "overview": "Juanjo (Antonio Pagudo) is a forty-year-old man who, despite not having low self-esteem due to his baldness, his wife, Inma (Eva Ugarte), obsessed with image and aesthetics, is in charge of making him complex about it. On the other hand, his friend Sebas (Carlos Librado \"Nene\") is affected by his lack of hair and is willing to do whatever it takes to regain his younger version, something that affects his ex-wife, Sofía (Amaia Salamanca) , and their daughters. Ready for anything, both get into a little trouble to get the money to allow them to travel to Turkey and have a hair transplant. In Istanbul they meet Rayco (Tomy Aguilera), a young reggaeton singer who is having great success, but after discovering his alopecia at a concert, he needs an urgent hair transplant. In this way, the three of them will try to seek happiness through aesthetics, but perhaps they will discover that there is something far beyond the physical."
