Since she got married, she has focused all of her efforts on caring for her family, until achieving what for her is a perfect family. However, her entire world begins to collapse with the arrival of Sara (Carolina Yuste), the girlfriend of her son; a young girl with great freedom and without mincing words who has a very different family from what Lucia always dreamed of as a political family. Now, Lucia must accept that the perfect family was not exactly what she thought."
