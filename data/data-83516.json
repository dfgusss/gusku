    "overview": "In the 1990s, many young women from Southeast Asia, carrying their hopes and dreams, were married off to this faraway island of riches...\r\n Through a two-part narrative, the film contrasts the past and the present of Taiwanese society. Can these immigrant women across different eras break free from their predicaments in this foreign land to rediscover themselves? Can they as well as the locals, live truly free lives?"
