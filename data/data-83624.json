    "overview": "Over the past six decades, thousands of women across the globe have become sick with an amalgam of mysterious and severe autoimmune disease symptoms. The common denominator in many of their cases? Breast implants. One such woman is beloved singer and media personality, Michelle Visage (RuPaul’s Drag Race) who, here, allows the audience into her journey to find wellbeing via “explant” surgery to remove her implants. Along the way, she introduces us to other women, all experiencing similar but uniquely debilitating indicators that their implants are poisoning them."
