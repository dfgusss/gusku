    "overview": "Join John Challis on his journey to the capital of Serbia, Belgrade, where he aims to uncover why ‘Only Fools and Horses’ is so popular in the small Balkan nation, apparently it’s the most watched show in Serbia, but why? Boycie is received in Serbia as almost a national hero, causing a media frenzy everywhere he goes on his voyage to learn about the people and the country. From a Royal Palace, to a brandy distillery, to a university teaching cockney rhyming slang; the documentary will keep you entertained as well as discover what it is that unites this tiny Balkan state with British humour."
