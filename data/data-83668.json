    "overview": "Buster, 11, loves everything about his life. He’s an optimist who knows that the going can get tough, but if you apply a little magic and a lot of love, things will work out. He's always willing to lend a helping hand to his little sister who has a limp, to his parents and to his old friend Mr. Larsen who is, like Buster, a \"master magician\". This summer, Buster hopes to be a big hit at the town’s talent show. But he has a lot on his plate: He has a crush on Joanna, Mr. Larsen’s health is deteriorating and his family also needs him. Here is where Faith, Hope and Charity save the day. That’s the way things work in Buster’s world."
