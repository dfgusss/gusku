    "overview": "Where is home? For a group of Chinese students studying and working in Tokyo, it might be the Nankokute restaurant whose manager has been in Japan for years without ever managing to obtain a residence permit. The cook left his family in China and hasn't yet managed to have them brought over to join him and one waiter's father is sick while the other's is a violent alcoholic. An engaging fresco of everyday life with touching moments and an authentic, natural atmosphere."
