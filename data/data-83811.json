    "overview": "Johannes, an innocent, Kaspar Hauser-like man with the heart of a child, lives secluded in an alpine hut together with his eagle and his devout mother. Daily life in this isolated world is governed by prayer and ritual. But suddenly, modern objects and disruptive noises intrude between nature and worship. A tourist development threatens to poison their paradise and awaken the devil."
