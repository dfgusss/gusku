    "overview": "To get through his one-week probationary contract, a young Moroccan plumber must deal with equally eccentric colleagues and customers. Valero, his superior, doubts Moha has what it takes, or that customers will accept a Moroccan worker. Maybe six days is not enough time for someone to overcome their prejudices. But it might be enough to discover that we must live together."
