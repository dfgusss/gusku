    "overview": "After environmental activist Kharis Redwater is called back to the living world by her mother Mary Lynn after a questionable “accident” that cost Kharis her life, an ancient spirit is reborn outside of a small northern town out of revenge for the loss of her daughter’s life. Kharis returns as a Wheetago, a ferocious creature that only gets hungrier the more it eats. Can an ex-military Park Ranger, Stacy Cole, and Police Officer, Betty Stonechild, call back their traditional teachings to stop Kharis before she continues to feed on all who get in her way?"
