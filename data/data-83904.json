    "overview": "In the 19th century, a young widow named Eva manages a remote winter fishing outpost in an Arctic bay, which she inherited after her husband, Magnus, was shipwrecked. The nearest settlement is three days' march away and inaccessible due to deep snow on the mountain trails. The outpost faces a harsh and brutal winter with rapidly dwindling supplies. Eva and her crew are already living on bait as their fishing catch declines. One morning on the beach, they witness a Basque whaling ship sinking far out near the cliffs known as \"the Teeth,\" which rise steeply from the sea. Eva now faces an impossible decision, as any attempt to rescue the survivors risks depleting the last supplies for her and her men even faster."
