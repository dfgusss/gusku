    "overview": "The Dog House is a legendary New York dive bar, owned by an extraordinary family. Three people, from different back grounds, enter at closing time on separate nights, carrying the world on their shoulders; but by the time each of them leaves after \"last call\", their souls are saved, while two of them realize how connected they are. Last Call at the Dog House is a unique and uplifting gay spiritual film that packs an emotional punch."
