    "overview": "Mathieu, a member of the French institute in Irkutsk, is arrested overnight by the Russian authorities.  Imprisoned and accused of sexual abuse on his own daughter, he realises he is a victim of a Kompromat. With the help of the FSB, someone has built up a case to frame him. Isolated, he has no one to turn to. Proving his innocence is impossible: the only solution is to escape."
