In the midst of moving out from their student flat, Maja’s evening takes a surprising turn when she stumbles upon an old relative who is without a doubt, dead. Nobody from the family is available to help, so Maja has to deal  with it herself. As she waits for the authorities, Sara, Maja’s childhood friend, joins her.
