    "overview": "When the family gets together, it's always a joy. But if you haven't seen your brother or sister or their families for a long time, the reunion is full of pretense and social niceties that sooner or later turn out to be false. What if you meet at the saddest event that awaits every family? The patriarch of the family is on his deathbed, and you have gradually gathered to measure his apartment to find out how much it will be worth when his heart stops beating."
