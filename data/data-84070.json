    "overview": "In 1957, Moscow sent a stray dog into space on Sputnik 2. She became the first living being to orbit the earth. She never returned. Her name was Laika. This inspired short begins with a catastrophe aboard an international space station that sends a lone Russian astronaut fleeing in an escape ship. Isolated and barreling through space in a half-mad state, he encounters… British Director Adam Fair has come up with a brilliant concept for a space-set horror film. One that thrills and surprises while also educating a new audience about Laika’s tragic story, tapping into energies of national guilt over her fate."
