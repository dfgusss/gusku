    "overview": "A perfect couple rents a holiday home on a sunny Italian island. The reality does not live up to their expectations when they find out that the pool in the house is broken. Ignorant of the fact that the island faces water shortage, they ask for someone to fix it. The constant presence of a stranger invades the couple's idea of safety and starts a chain of events, which makes them act instinctively and irrationally, heading to the darkest place in their relationship."
