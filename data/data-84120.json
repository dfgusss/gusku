    "overview": "When Zoe Williams has to prove to a big investor that her company's new dating app works, she tests it on herself and soon ends up on a date with her complete opposite, Oliver Beckett, an easygoing, spontaneous artist. Huh. Not exactly Zoe's type. Even though it's clear the pair have chemistry, Zoe's worried- could something be wrong with DigiLove's algorithm? Or is it true when people say \"opposites attract\"?"
