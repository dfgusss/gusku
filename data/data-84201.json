    "overview": "The Man Who Knew Too Much is a documentary film by Michael Oswald about Colin Wallace, a former Senior Information Officer at the Ministry of Defence, UK. As part of his work Colin Wallace engaged in PsyOps and spread fake news, he and his colleagues created a witchcraft scare, smeared politicians and attempted to divide and create conflict amongst communities, organisations and individuals. Colin Wallace fell out with sections of the British intelligence community, he was framed for a murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison. 15 years after his conviction the sentence was quashed on appeal after the Home Office coroner admitted his report had been influenced by a member of the intelligence community.\r\n The Man Who Knew Too Much is a unique and in-depth look at the smoke and mirrors world of intelligence, psychological warfare and fake news through the eyes of a man who stood proudly at the centre of that world."
