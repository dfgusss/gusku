    "overview": "Between 1988 and 1992, British Electronic duo The KLF had scored #1 records throughout the world and had become household names. Determined to ridicule the establishment, they battled The Beatles and ABBA after sampling their music in hit records, and published the best-selling book The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way). In 1993, to mock performance art in the ultimate fashion, The KLF set fire to £1,000,000 in cash and destroyed their entire catalogue, vanishing from the public view... until now."
