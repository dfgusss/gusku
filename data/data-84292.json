    "overview": "After a devastating battle against a diabolical turtle, a team of five avengers — known as the \"Tobacco Force\" — is sent on a mandatory retreat to strengthen their decaying group cohesion, where they share scary stories the film depicts. Their storytelling sojourn goes wonderfully well until Lézardin, Emperor of Evil, decides to annihilate planet Earth."
