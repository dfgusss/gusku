    "overview": "Through a unique architectural and engineering lens, “Rise & Fall: The World Trade Center” recounts the inspiring, true story behind an American icon, and the remarkable group of people who dreamed it and made it real. No ordinary pair of buildings, the Twin Towers featured a unique structural design—and dozens of other technical breakthroughs—that made the then-tallest buildings in the world possible. But did these innovations contribute to their collapse on 9/11? With the help of harrowing first-hand testimonies, expert interviews, and never-before-seen graphics, and with the benefit of two decades of engineering hindsight, viewers will understand how the Towers rose…and why they fell."
