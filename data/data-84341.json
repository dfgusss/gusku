    "overview": "Meet a diverse group of men, real men across the globe all sharing the same name: James Bond. Australian director Matthew Bauer's energetic exploration of masculine identity features a gay New York theatre director, a Swedish 007 super-fan with a Nazi past, an African American Bond accused of murder, the ornithologist whose name was stolen by author Ian Fleming to name his fictional secret agent, and two resilient women caught up in it all."
