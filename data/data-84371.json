    "overview": "A group of Malayali travellers, returning to Kerala by bus after their visit to Velankanni, all doze off in a lazy nap after lunch. One of the travelers, James, stops the bus in a village in Tamil Nadu. He starts behaving like a native of the place and speaking in Tamil, confusing his fellow passengers and the villagers alike. He walks amidst faith, delusion, dream and trance, followed by others."
