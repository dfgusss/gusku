    "overview": "The story is a psycho-drama full of turns of events right from the opening scene and well after the credits. Icaro, a man in his late thirties with a wife and a child he loves and a safe job in a bank, is all of a sudden reminded of his boyhood ambition when Ombra, an eerie creature belonging to his cradle-day memories, reappears in his life. With Ombra back, nothing can ever be the same. Ancient dreams and hidden skeletons plummet the protagonist into spiraling insanity as present and past collide."
