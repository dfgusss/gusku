    "overview": "Tom Riley wanders out of the woods behind his home on Steelmanville Road and must climb through the window to get inside. He is baffled by objects in the house that aren’t his and things moving on their own. He soon finds himself dealing with evil forces that cause him to rely on the help of others to try and figure out once and for all how to rid the house of evil…including the most powerful demon he has ever faced!"
