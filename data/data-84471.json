    "overview": "When Sam, the designer behind a popular home renovation show, returns to her hometown during the holidays to help renovate the Bell Harbor Inn, she gets paired with Coop as her lead contractor. The only problem — he's the guy who broke her heart and she's the one who got away. Sparks fly as they work closely to get the renovations done in time for the inn's annual Christmas Eve Harborfest."
