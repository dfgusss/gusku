    "overview": "﻿After a truly trash year, actor, producer, and New York Times bestselling author Phoebe Robinson is finally out of quarantine and ready to get back onstage. Bringing her signature brand of authentic confessional humor to her first-ever solo stand-up special, Robinson gets real about therapy, interracial dating, reparations, hanging out with Michelle Obama, aging out of watching civil rights movies, and more in a no-holds-barred hour of comedy that’s both unflinchingly honest – and uniquely hilarious."
