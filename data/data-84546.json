    "overview": "Kasino is a youth comedy based on true stories told by a wide range of people about the time when mobile phones first appeared in the hands of young people. For decades, young people from all over Finland gathered in youth centers like Kasino in Kauhajoki, where music was important, but the most important thing was to see friends. And perhaps to behave irresponsibly."
