    "overview": "Nour is a 13-year-old orphan living in the countryside in the early 1980s. He is smart, but is also a compulsive liar with vision problems and wears eyeglasses that don't quite remedy his weakened eyesight. To gain the respect of his fellow classmates, he ventures inside a haunted house right in front of the school, one that all the kids are afraid to enter. Inside, he finds a solitary old man who's hiding from the world. A friendship and apprenticeship are born between the boy and the old man, initiating a journey of self-discovery that lies at the very heart of this light-hearted drama."
