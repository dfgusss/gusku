    "overview": "The Felpetos have managed a clandestine lottery business for decades. The family enterprise operates in a small housing development. Maribel leads a crew of clerks who log the bets from her living room. Alejandra, her mother, lives in an identicalhouse just a few meters away, which serves as the administrative office. Some lotto bankers have been raided lately, and the atmosphere in the neighborhood has become strage since. There has been talk about police dismissals and big-money movements. Nobody can tell what is true from the rumors or the news on TV"
