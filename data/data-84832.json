    "overview": "In Boston, the city that brought us Cheers, there really is a place where the staff know all the regulars by name. But it's not a bar, it's a downtown diner that's been there since the 1940s and has become a historical and cultural icon. 24 Hours At The South Street Diner introduces a diverse group of waiters, regulars, late-night revelers and local celebrities who call Boston's only 24/7 restaurant home. They share stories of why this tiny diner means so much to the neighborhood and the city of Boston and how it's survived fires, bankruptcies and even an attempt to revoke its late night license."
