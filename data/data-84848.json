    "overview": "Five people are recruited by the Viking Society to collaborate on the first manned mission to Mars. They were chosen because of the psychological similarities they share with the five astronauts who will travel to the red planet. These volunteers therefore form a B-team of alter egos who will experience the adventure in parallel, behind closed doors on Earth."
