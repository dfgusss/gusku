    "overview": "Four American teenagers have received a mission from God that takes them from the safety of their remote religion-filled bubbles to the other side of the planet. In the frozen forested lands of Finland, these impassioned, wide-eyed teens confront local Finns, Europe’s most non-religious and private people, and attempt to convert them to their faith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints."
