    "overview": "In order to leave a lasting impression in space, Dr. Georg Friedle and his team of researchers include a condensed version of world history with the 1977 Voyager mission. However, their attempt to present themselves as an intelligent and empathic race backfires unchecked: their version presents a completely insane species whose development is apparently based on pure luck rather than solid reason. A planet where Greek philosophers are celebrated as rap stars, religion is touted as a clever marketing concept, stag parties serve as a secret weapon in the First World War and the construction of the Great Wall of China is a misunderstanding of honest Berlin craftsmanship. Even the revelation of the alleged true background to the assassination attempt on Hitler is likely to make experienced historians see the end of humanity as a mere matter of time."
