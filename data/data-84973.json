    "overview": "Axel is an employee of a call center who is used to complaints from his clients and an unbearable boss. Axel has a natural talent for dealing with people and their problems. But one day everything changes, when he receives a call from Figueroa Mont, a frustrated client who wants to unsubscribe. Fed up with the bureaucracy of the companies, Figueroa warns Axel that he is watching him through a telescopic sight attached to a high-precision rifle and that if he does not solve the problem, he will blow his head off."
