    "overview": "In a follow-up to Restaurant Hustle 2020: All on the Line, Executive Producer Guy Fieri asks four of America's favorite chefs -- Maneet Chauhan, Antonia Lofaso, Christian Petroni, and Marcus Samuelsson -- to turn the cameras back on and document the new highs and lows of navigating the re-emerging restaurant industry in 2021. With the dominance of COVID-19 slowly receding and states and cities coming back to life in a variety of ways, each chef has a unique plan to get cooking and get their restaurants -- and themselves -- back on track. The year also offers Maneet, Antonia, Christian, and Marcus fresh opportunities and challenges to shine in the ever-changing food industry, media landscape, and restaurant business."
