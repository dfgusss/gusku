    "overview": "Hockey club star Maxim Kovalev, the son of the deceased billionaire and the owner of the team, is not used to holding back emotions. Neither at a hockey match, nor when a traffic cop slows him down on the way to an important game and wants to arrange everything \"according to the rules\" ... A simple conflict turns into a fatal situation for him, which radically changes his life. He's facing time. Will Maxim be able to survive? Will the star-studded hockey player be able to improve? And who will help him in this? After all, a trucker driver, an employee of the investigative committee, traffic cops, and motorists stuck in a snow disaster turned out to be on the road together."
