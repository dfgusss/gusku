    "overview": "A young filmmaker returns to the village where she was born – a hamlet in the north of France – to investigate a strange story about a terrorist threat. She starts with members of her own family, and doesn’t have to go much further. The misunderstanding – as it turns out to be – shows above all how alarmist news items and political machinations in the cities can take on a life of their own, deep in the hinterland."
