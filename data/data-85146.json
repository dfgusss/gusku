    "overview": "On May 8, 1978, it was unusually quiet in the Aftonbladet editorial office. A stenciled document lay on every desk. \"About our life at Aftonbladet, by the women in the Aftonbladet editorial office\" was the text on the red cover, and the pages contained testimonies of sexual harassment and a deep-rooted alcohol culture in the workplace. The manifesto created a heated debate and later led to Aftonbladet starting the first women's editorial office in Swedish press. This documentary is about how the Document, 40 years before #metoo, changed the world, at least a little."
