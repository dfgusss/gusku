    "overview": "Born into a poor family with eight children in Kahramanmaraş, Dilber Ay endured many sorrows and hardships in the life she began in a tent. At the age of 13, she was sold to an older man for money, they married, and had children. She was beaten and tortured for singing, but despite all the pain she endured, she rose to the top of the stage with the strength she drew from her God-given voice, and she also experienced prison. She never gave up, always singing her way out of the bottomless pits she fell into."
