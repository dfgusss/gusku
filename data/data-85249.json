    "overview": "Mickey Mouse is one of the most enduring symbols in our history. Those three simple circles take on meaning for virtually everyone on the planet. So ubiquitous in our lives that he can seem invisible, Mickey is something we all share, with unique memories and feelings. Over the course of his nearly century-long history, Mickey functions like a mirror, reflecting our personal and cultural values back at us. \"Mickey: The Story of a Mouse\" explores Mickey's significance, getting to the core of what Mickey's cultural impact says about each of us and about our world."
