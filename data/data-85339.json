He thinks she’s his soulmate, but his autism and trusting nature keep him from realizing she’s actually a prostitute. Violet realizes something is different about Shawn, and it’s not just because he has a condition that allows him to “hear” colors. Shawn thinks he’s found a potential wife, while Violet thinks she’s found her ticket out of her own trapped life. Based on the award-winning novel."
