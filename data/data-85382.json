    "overview": "Mack attempts to connect spiritually with her recently deceased sister by escaping to her family’s rustic cabin. Her seclusion is quickly cut short when Alex, her Type A childhood bestie, crashes the private grief retreat, bringing Dylan, her own offbeat friend with her. Emotions run high as Alex attempts to bond with a growingly resentful Mack, and tensions mount as Dylan’s true feelings for Alex begin to show."
