    "overview": "Warsaw, 1968. Students protesting against the illegal expulsion of their colleagues from university and in defence of play Dziady, directed by Kazimierz Dejmek and performed at the National Theatre, which has been taken off the bill. Among the protesting young people are also Hania and Janek. Their families are on both sides of the March barricade. Young and madly in love with each other, like in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet in a country in revolt, they fight for their affection. Will their love survive? Will they be able to overcome the adversities that fate throws at them?"
