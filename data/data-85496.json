Staying at the town’s charming Lemon Tree Farm, Beck meets gruff but handsome owner Joshua, and the pair strike a deal: he’ll help her discover the town’s hidden gems if she helps with the farm’s PR. Working together is no walk in the park to begin, but sparks soon fly when they discover they have more in common than they first thought… Could love be in the air, or will one big secret ruin the fledgling romance?"
