    "overview": "José Eduardo, known as Zé, owns a small football school and wins a trip with his wife and blogger daughter to Cartagena in a raffle. José Eduardo, known as Edu, is a successful businessman who is going on vacation with his wife and son. The confusion begins when, by mistake, Zé stays at Edu's luxury hotel, which, in turn, ends up at Zé's simple inn. This exchange provides experiences that the two families were not used to, but which ends up uniting them even more."
