Pushed over the edge, Johnny Jones suffers a mental breakdown and ignites a killing spree never seen in history, leaving a trail of death and carnage everywhere he goes. While the tensions and the murders only get worse, the city calls Detective Cutchin (Tom Sizemore) to solve the case and bring Johnny Jones to justice."
