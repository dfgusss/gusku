    "overview": "Worlds collide at an awkward dinner party in 1959 New England. Tables turn when a progressive biracial couple attends dinner at the imposing home of an unexceptional artist and questionable psychiatrist. By daybreak, they find themselves pawns in a cynical game that exposes the cracks in their facades."
