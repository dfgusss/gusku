    "overview": "The story of four lifelong friends who met in the 2000s when they were presidents of the BDE of the Nantes Institute of Business. At the time, they were the \"Bioman\": the kings of partying, excess and \"transmutation\". 20 years later, they have mellowed out and lead well-ordered lives. Except... Once a year, when they get together for the WEB: the Bioman Weekend. There, they \"transmute\" hard as they like to say. In short: they drink and sing in a pathetic way."
