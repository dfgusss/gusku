    "overview": "Alma lives a humble and secluded life behind the walls of a contemporary Catholic convent in Denmark. As she prepares for her perpetual vows as a nun, her older brother Erik unexpectedly shows up. He is a recovering alcoholic and clearly depressed, yet Alma struggles to show him mercy, as his presence unearths a family secret she has desperately tried to suppress. With the ceremony impending, Alma begins to lose her footing and doubt whether she is worthy of the love of her God."
