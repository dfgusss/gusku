    "overview": "Zombie Land Saga: Yumeginga Paradise builds upon the original TV series' unique setting with an expanded scale. The idol group Franchouchou, which initially set out to revitalize a region, is reborn in this film as a symbolic entity carrying the future of the Earth. While preserving the quirky charm of zombie idols, the film’s direction is more dazzling, suited to the theater screen. In particular, the climax's live performance scene introduces new potential in idol anime by seamlessly blending music and drama, offering both laughter and heartfelt emotion."
