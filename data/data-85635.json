While the UFO phenomenon has existed since the dawn of recorded history, very little scientific research is accessible to the public. Most of the serious research is conducted by various governments and militaries across the planet; this film is a documentary on how a team of military veterans, scientists, and researchers come together and launch an investigation into this fascinating world of the unknown while providing the data and results to the public."
