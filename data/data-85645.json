    "overview": "In a small town in central France, Simon is a priest devoted to his parish. During a mass, Louise, whom he hadn’t seen since his seminary years ago, reappears. She introduces him to Aloé, an 11-year-old child, who is his son. This news will disrupt his daily life: can he be a good priest for his parishioners and a good father for his child? Simon will try to convince the highest authorities of the Church that his vocation is compatible with paternal love."
