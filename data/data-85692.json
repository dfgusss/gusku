    "overview": "The Warkop trio — Dono, Kasino, and Indro — are dragged into the most daring mission yet: disguise themselves as Indonesian national team players in a World Cup qualifier to sabotage a match in the fictional country of West Korea and stop a conspiracy that could trigger a nuclear war. But saving the world is only a small part of their job as CHIPS agents. They also have to hunt down their own rebellious robots; and transform into elementary school children to uncover a national exam cheating scandal."
