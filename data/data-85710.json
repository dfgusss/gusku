Guitarist Tony has drunk himself to poverty when a message reaches him: after years of sobriety, singer Katarina has relapsed and is in dire straits. Tony gets a visit from Katarina's distant daughter Ellie. She's looking for answers to questions about her family - in exchange for the key to the band's comeback. Wanting to reclaim their fame and money, Tony and bassist Pete set out on an adventure - determined to bring No Love Lost back."
