    "overview": "The horror begins as Ayla and her high-school friends discover a hideous, semi-human mutant. They keep it prisoner while shooting repulsive viral videos, but the gang’s hunger for “likes” drives them to film the beast performing murderous acts. When one boy sees that Ayla is using the monster’s gruesome violence to settle her own vendettas, he threatens to tell the authorities, but is he too late to save his friends?"
