    "overview": "Tridan Lagache has spent his whole life at Club Med, changing friends every 8 days. At 50, he resigns from the vacation spot where he was born, determined to track down his great mini-club childhood love, Violette.  He shows up in Paris, naïve and lost but glad to be lodged by Louis, a half-brother he never knew he had. In order to be rid of the cumbersome Tridan, Louis passes one of his fling off as Violette, and Tridan, all emotional, thinks he recognizes her at first glance."
