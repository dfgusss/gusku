    "overview": "Documentary on the life and art of  Marie Cermínová AKA Toyen or “the baroness” to her friends. Long considered a marginal figure, it was not until her death in 1980, when her estate was auctioned off, that Toyen’s masterpieces finally saw the light of day.  This film is a portrait of an important figure of the European artistic avant-garde in the 20th century."
