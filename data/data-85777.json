    "overview": "Getting dressed for a night out in Lagos is serious business. The Nigerian megatropolis is home to one of Africa’s most vibrant party scenes, one where the best dressed peacocks in town strut their stuff to the wildly popular sound of afrobeats. “Borderline sleazy, sweaty necks, and chests, chilling outdoors on a cool Lagos night . . . I mean, it just had to be the starting point!” says Maki Oh designer Amaka Osakwe of the bombastic style that inspired her first foray into menswear. “The name of the collection kind of says it all: Because Men in Silk Shirts on Lagos Nights.”"
