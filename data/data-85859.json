    "overview": "Christmas is coming. The children accidentally break a Nativity scene figurine from their father's collection and must by all means get an equal one, the problem is that it is a unique antique piece. Sara, the eldest daughter breaks up with her boyfriend, Ocho, who will try to recover her favors with the help of her father-in-law, Javier. Precisely Javier's father-in-law, Marisa's father, will be welcomed into the family home to spend the holidays after her recent separation, which will not leave Javier's mother, Milagros, indifferent. Rocío, the folklore of the family, who has been playing the Virgin for several Christmases, is relegated this year to playing the shepherdess, something that her father, Javier, is not willing to assume."
