    "overview": "Emilio, a shy, not too brilliant pupil at a humble local secondary school, has always harboured a secret love for Natalia, the cutest, brightest girl in the class. On the last day of the school year, when he finally decides to declare his love, Natalia is awarded a scholarship to study Medicine at Oxford. It would seem that all is lost for Emilio, but his drop-out school-pals are not ready to throw in the towel. After faking qualifications and scholarships, this band of brainless nuts land in Oxford, causing havoc in the normally peaceful campus existence.  —The Film Catalogue"
