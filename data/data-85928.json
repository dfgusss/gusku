    "overview": "After leaving his family's sheep farm in the Australian outback, a young man joins his countrymen on the western front of World War I with hopes of helping expedite an end to the bloody conflict. But as war rages on, he is forced to grapple with the brutal realities of trench warfare, including a near-constant battle to keep himself alive—without leaving another man behind.\r Inspired by the real-life diary entries of local ANZACs, the feature film details the untold story of some of Australia’s greatest military victories."
