    "overview": "Comedian/actor Helen Hong spent Covid quarantine trying to date doomsday preppers, stealing her dog's Xanax, and trying to teach the world that China is not the only country in Asia. She also had a baby... kind of. (But don't tell her Korean parents). Helen's special was taped at the Tribeca Festival in NY, one of the first events to re-open the city post-lockdown."
