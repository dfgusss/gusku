In spite of that, the company and her family force her hand as usual… While she is living her usual life, her friend Anna comes to see her. Anna, Jia’s role-model as the CEO of a company, suggests going on a tour around the country in a convertible the very next day but Jia refuses to go due to the pile of work she has to do and her upcoming surgery. And the day after, Jia faces the mourning portrait of Anna. Suffering from burn-out, Jia buys a ‘Cabriolet’ convertible with the money she saved up for surgery and takes off on a tour around the country."
