Sheinberg is overwhelmed by the situation that affects him beyond his professional level and decides to go to Israel. There, with the help of Rubén, an old friend of his grandfather, he will “travel” in time, entering the ancient history of Israel, seeing himself reflected in the ancient character Jacob.
