    "overview": "Home2Home tells the story of Dennis Kailing who travels 43,600 km (27,000 miles) through 41 countries on 6 continents to circumnavigate the planet in 761 days. He does it on a bicycle - on his first bike journey ever. With the question \"What makes you happy\", but without experience in bike traveling, the 24-year-old from Germany jumps into the deep end and simply sets off - always heading east. He's traveling alone, but he's rarely lonely: many encounters with interesting, crazy or \"completely normal\" people give him insights that ordinary tourists rarely experience. While others like a well-structured all inclusive tour, this bike tour is a journey into uncertainty. But in the uncertainty hides the biggest adventure - Dennis gradually becomes aware of this."
