    "overview": "After her parents' deaths, Ariana Alvarez is lost and can’t hold down a 9 to 5 job no matter how hard she tries, which isn’t that hard. To help her navigate post-college life, her doting Tío Jorge gets her a seasonal membership at his swanky country club and challenges her to make some friends… complete with a hopelessly hot caddy. But Ariana soon learns that life among the wealthy and golf-obsessed is a lot like being back in high school: cliques abound, mean girls everywhere, and only the richest kids get to call the shots."
