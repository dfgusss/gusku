    "overview": "A fractured family of four brothers and one sister confront haunting memories of their mother’s passing fifteen years ago.  Fifteen years had passed, as Nicole (Summer Chan) returns home to Hong Kong to be reunited with her three brothers, clinging to the shattered memory from the night of her mother’s passing.  Through hypnosis sessions with her big brother Joseph (Simon Yam), the trauma that the family sustained is unexpectedly reawakened when she desires to connect back with the memories.  Then, the whole world around this family takes on a dark form and love becomes almost undefinable."
