    "overview": "The pandemic brought society to a standstill, but from an animal’s perspective the world didn't change that much. Unless, of course, you live in a zoo. What was life like in the Salzburg zoo when no visitors were allowed? Microstories from the pavilions, enclosures, and terraria, told with Horvath’s typical sense of humor."
