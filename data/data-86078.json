    "overview": "Comedian and actress Nikki Glaser takes on a range of topics in her brutally-honest yet conversational style. Whether she’s dishing about sex, outlining the do’s and dont’s of dating (and how to trick someone into marriage), or oversharing about her (not-so-private) parts, Glaser delivers an hour of unapologetic and no-holds-barred comedy around topics often considered “taboo,” and showcases her ability to pivot from humiliating moments to being an empowering voice for women: the kind she yearned for as a confused adolescent."
