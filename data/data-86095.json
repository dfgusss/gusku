    "overview": "In the microcosm of a private school, the latent traumas of adults coexist with the teenager’s wild search for identity. From somewhere on its walls, travelers could glimpse suggestive ports, but no one finds enough energy to leave the trip. The fruits of the past lay roots that imprison and immobilize those who close their eyes as salvation."
