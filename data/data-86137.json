    "overview": "By the time Johnny Cash released his iconic “Man in Black” album in 1971, the international superstar was broken down, hollow-eyed, and wrung out - often torn between Jesus and the “Cocaine Blues.” This tells the true story of a music legend’s spiritual quest, and his ultimate return to an “unshakeable faith.”"
