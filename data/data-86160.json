    "overview": "Genevieve Harper makes the most out of raising her two siblings after their parents' tragic accident. At just 24, Viv has devoted herself to providing her family with the best life possible, sacrificing her own dreams along the way. When Trent Fox, a known player on and off the baseball field, shows up at Viv’s job, the Lotus House Yoga Center to recuperate, the attraction between the two of them is instant. But Viv does not have time to devote to a man, let alone a man who will only break her heart. Can love grow between a woman who’s rooted in her life and a man who resists any notion of setting roots down?"
