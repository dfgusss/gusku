    "overview": "Digital artist Lex Carre documents her struggle with anxiety through work that she posts anonymously online. Her pieces capture the attention of cunning curator Andrea Caulfield, who offers mentorship in exchange for control of Lex’s career.  When Lex’s mental health starts to spiral from the pressure, Andrea assumes ownership of her work—prompting Lex to plot a psychological showdown against the exploitative mentor who stole her art and nearly destroyed her mind."
