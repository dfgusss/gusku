    "overview": "It's the year of the baccalaureate for Magyd, a little Arab from rue Raphaël, northern districts of Toulouse. A formality for the French, a seismic event for the “native”. Just think, the first Arab ferry in the city. The end of a tunnel, the climax of a long standoff with fate, under the incessant loving pressure of the all-powerful mother and the jeering quelibets of the gang. Because it is not good to pass for an “intellectual” after school, in the periphery of “living together”; Magyd and his inseparable friends, Samir the activist and Momo the chat artist, experience it on a daily basis."
