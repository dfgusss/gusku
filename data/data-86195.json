French Member of the European Parliament José Bové, maverick politician and prominent figure of the environmental party, suspects a setup by the tobacco manufacturer Swedish Match, potentially involving the President of the European Commission, José Barroso. Standing alone against all odds, he decides to investigate and unravel this story, which shook the foundations of the entire European institutions."
