Invited to Japan for the reedition of her first book, she is welcomed by her local editor who takes her to Kyoto, the city of shrines and temples. As they travel together through the Japanese spring blossoms, she slowly opens up to him.  But the ghost of her husband follows Sidonie: she will have to finally let go of the past to let herself love again."
