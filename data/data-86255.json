Once arrived, they meet a mentally deranged woman named Maria Miyoshi who proclaims she's a fan of Kuroishi's works. The woman pleads that she's experienced the same things as documented in Kuroishi's works. Unexplainable phenomena quickly begin to happen, so Kuroishi sets out to document these experiences and turn them into a film, together with the help of a 'super volunteer' named Shôhei Uno and a handsome psychic medium named Nanashi."
