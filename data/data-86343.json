    "overview": "Amit, Om, Javed and Bhupen - a group of four friends - have come a long way in life. Bhupen had a lifelong dream of going to Mount Everest with his three friends but the idea is quashed immediately as soon as he expresses it to them during a get-together. However, Bhupen's sudden death leads the trio to leave their cozy Delhi lives and trek to Everest Base Camp as friendship was their only motivation."
