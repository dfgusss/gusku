    "overview": "Set in the peak of the 1960s Civil Rights movement, “Paul's Promise” is the inspiring true story of Paul Holderfield, former racist firefighter-turned-pastor who started one of the first integrated churches in the American South. It’s one man’s journey to hope and healing during a troubled time in our Nation’s history that resulted in one man’s decision to serve God and stand up to injustice - a story that continues to make a huge impact on the community to this day."
