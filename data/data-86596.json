    "overview": "A boy, whose mother used to prohibit his time travel games, has grown into an adult. He executes his everyday life like any man - exercising at the gym, working as a nightclub bouncer and spending his spare time with those who just happened to end up around him. An ordinary day comes to a halt when he runs into a familiar woman - with whom he hasn’t met before. The twosome develop an unprecedented sense of connection which makes them question everything they have believed in. As their self-evident future together starts to shine in the horizon, his repressed childhood enters from behind it. Encountering the past drives at stake both - the hopes for true love and his sense of reality."
