    "overview": "Bookended by Inauguration Day 2021 and the State of the Union speech of March 2022, this documentary is a front-seat account of the Biden administration’s tense first year, marked by security threats both at home and abroad. Assuming office only two weeks after the January 6th attack on the Capitol, Biden’s presidency entered the maelstrom of an ongoing global pandemic, renewed conflicts with Russia and China, and America’s international standing in decline."
