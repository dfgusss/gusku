    "overview": "Sara has come to terms with her position as a detached observer of other people's lives. She is fascinated when she meets the gallant, graceful, and soft-faced Martin. Gradually, their connection grows, but when Sara wants to take their relationship to a deeper and more physical level, Martin shies away. He is hiding a deep secret. Refusing to accept his unwillingness to open up to her, Sara compels him to expose himself, and when he finally does, it turns out he is intersex, a hermaphrodite. Sara’s love remains strong, but when she unintentionally reveals Martin’s secret to her family, she discovers that her joy at the relationship has blinded her to the reality of how society deals with “freaks.”"
