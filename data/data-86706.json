    "overview": "30-year-old Muscovite Aiko’s father, with whom she had not communicated for many years, died - he was a tyrant, and she does not feel sorry for him. But for some reason she goes to Kazakhstan for the funeral, where she sees her father’s second family for the first time: the sister is unbearable, the brother is out of this world, the stepmother is the same age as Aiko herself. And the strangest thing is that for them dad was completely different."
