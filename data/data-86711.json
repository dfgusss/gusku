    "overview": "Son confesses to his mother, Ana, that he does not feel like a girl; he is a boy. Confused and blocked, Ana will decide to stop in order to observe and understand him and, in the same way, to understand herself. Ana and Son are two sides of the same coin: a mother who does not take care of herself, of her own identity, and a boy in search of his identity with all his strength."
