    "overview": "Above and Beyond highlights one of the most compelling escape and survival stories from World War II. On December 1, 1943, Bruce Sundlun's bomber drew fire from German fighter planes and crashed in Nazi-occupied Belgium. With help from an underground network, Bruce fled to occupied France, where he joined the Resistance. He would go on to spy for the OSS, the precursor to the CIA."
