    "overview": "In Czechoslovakia, between 1946 and 1971, the characters of two very different fairy tales interacted and enriched each other: on the one hand, the filmmakers of the Czechoslovak New Wave who, through poetic, committed and ambitious cinema, fought against the Soviet yoke with subtle irony; and, on the other, the writer Jan Procházka, who in 1968 added his voice to the popular outcry of the Prague Spring."
