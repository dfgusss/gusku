    "overview": "Rooted in current news this investigation traces back Russia's intervention in Syria and sheds light on the war in Ukraine in a different way. Since 2015 in Syria, Vladimir Putin has benefited from the inaction of the United States and its European allies. It is also in Syria that Russia has experimented with its weapons and war diplomacy. This documentary recounts the broad outlines of Russian intervention in the Syrian conflict to understand how it has shaped the Kremlin's foreign policy over the last decade and how it made Vladimir Putin believe that he could easily defeat the Ukrainians. Filmed in Russia, Syria, Europe and the United States, this programmed is full of expert testimonies and archives."
