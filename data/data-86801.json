    "overview": "A deep space mission called Pioneer is seeking a new home for humankind. During its long voyage, a malfunction forces one of the crew to wake up from cryo-sleep. During the years alone, he develops the mind and abilities of the on-board A.I. system but is unaware to the extent of its awakening. Does it hold the answers to save humankind or the means to finish our existence? Having purposefully augmented itself via a black hole and now redirected to return to Earth, only time will tell."
