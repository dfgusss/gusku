    "overview": "Look out for the Karate Girl! Injustice has reigned over the quiet town of Shek O in Hong Kong. Chu Po is a young masked vigilante out to help those in need and kick a baddie’s ass. Just as her social-media popularity increases, so do her frequent injuries, as she learns that her beginner’s skills may be no match for those of more experienced fighters. Fate draws her to a local church infested with illicit drug-dealing activities. She soon realizes her connection to that church is more personal than expected as there’s a link to her family’s past. Should she simply stay in the shadows and pray for a miracle, or put her karate chops to good use?"
