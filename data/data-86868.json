    "overview": "Vigilantes Inc.: America’s New Vote Suppression Hitmen  The 2024 election is in danger:  8,500 self-proclaimed vigilante vote-fraud hunters have already challenged the rights of 851,000 voters of color.  Investigative reporter Greg Palast (Guardian/Rolling Stone) hunts down the MAGA vigilantes including one dressed like Doc Holliday—with his loaded 6-guns—who blocked the vote of 4,000 Black soldiers including MAJ Gamaliel Turner.  Palast and Major Turner confront the vote rustlers in scenes humorous, weird and dangerous."
