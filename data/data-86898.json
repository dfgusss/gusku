    "overview": "An international team of scientists venture into the virtually unknown interior of Antarctica to explore a lake buried 3,600 feet beneath the ice. Their success hinges on the performance of their custom-built hot water drill and their ability to work as a team in the harshest climate on the planet. As they struggle against the ferocity of the ice and wind to unravel mysteries buried deep under Antarctica, they consider how our relationship with nature – and with one another — will impact humanity’s future and the future of all life on our rapidly changing planet."
