    "overview": "Former mob leader Shi Sanburo is released from prison and works as a car parker while trying to start a small pub business. One day, Sanburo is caught and sees his son in the police station. Knowing that he has stirred up troubles with gangsters, Sanburo tries to resolve the problem. Never would he expect the leader to be the son of his once triad brother, who double-crossed him and put him in jail. The sons will now fight at the Boxing Championship, bearing the conflicts of their own and the histories of their fathers. Chan Tai-lee, director of Tomorrow Is Another Day[14th], explores a troubled father-son relationship this time, driven by a compelling performance from veteran actor Patrick Tam."
