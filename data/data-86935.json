    "overview": "Shot between Sardinia, Rome, London, Paris, Baltimore and Los Angeles, the film tells of the arrival of Hollywood at Capo Caccia in 1967, when the film \"Boom\" by Joseph Losey was shot, with the stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Although the film, produced with a high budget for the time, aspired to become an international success, it was one of the most sensational flops in the history of cinema."
