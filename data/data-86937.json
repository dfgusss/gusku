    "overview": "Cengiz is the singer at a tea garden in Bursa and his greatest ambition is to release an album. Cengiz's life changes when he meets Taskin. Believing that the song composed by Taskin's father, Serafettin, would be a great start for his album, Cengiz buys the song using money he borrowed from his older brother. When Taskin spends all that money, Cengiz starts performing with Taskin and his sister Arzu."
