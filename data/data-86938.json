    "overview": "A fairy tale writer Yonghee lives a soulless living after losing his wife. He has been unable to enter the room for a long time where his wife used to paint, as he has hyperventilation symptoms whenever he enters the room. One day, strange sounds are heard from the room. As he courageously opens the door, water is leaking from the ceiling. In the room, a kitten that Jane secretly has hidden has lived there. Moreover, Roan, a carpenter who comes to repair the ceiling, suggests to make this abandoned room into a cat room. What will Yonghee choose?"
