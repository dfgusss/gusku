    "overview": "General Khadyakov turns sixty. He decides to ditch Moscow for a day and celebrate his birthday in an authentic Russian village with an immersive countryside experience. Fishing, a jolly feast, a visit to the banya, and a farm-style spa - that's the plan, and all of his beloved friends are coming. But the party goes awry: the rich guests manage to turn the whole village against themselves, get into a nasty quarrel and lose all the food."
