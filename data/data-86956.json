    "overview": "For Marisol Rivera, a first generation Mexican-American, college is everything she's worked toward. She spent mornings cleaning horse stalls and evenings studying. Now, with a scholarship in hand, she's ready to leave Southwest Texas and begin her new life. However, when Marisol is falsely accused of a crime, she learns a heartbreaking truth: she's undocumented. Forced to go on the run, Marisol discovers a kind America amidst a harsh bureaucratic system. A coming of age film through the lens of immigration, Marisol critically examines systemic oppression and the causality of racism."
