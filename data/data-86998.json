    "overview": "Katya is a landscape designer. On December 31, she delivers New Year's trees to customers. The last tree from the unfulfilled order could have become Katya's only guest for the New Year, but her mother is determined to introduce her daughter to a young man. To avoid this fate, the girl agrees to meet her uncle, her neighbor from Chicago. From this moment on, the longest day of the outgoing year begins for her: she will pick up the wrong uncle from the airport, meet a man, hide from bandits pursuing her... and on New Year's Eve she will again find herself at her tree, but will she be alone?"
