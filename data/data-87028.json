When his congregation is violently attacked, police quickly arrest a young white nationalist who threatened them in the past, but Rabbi Mo doesn’t believe the troubled teen is a killer. Since no one else will investigate, Rabbi Mo becomes the detective. As bodies pile up, he must learn how to use a gun to battle the real enemy."
