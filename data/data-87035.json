    "overview": "The larger themes of life have slowly found their way into Goedemondt's small, safe world. He wasn't been waiting for that at all. How long can you deal maturely with, for example, parenthood, the future, and death as a forty-something? If it's up to Goedemondt: quite a while. He still doesn't stop his childish shouting and ranting, and he still taunts, rebukes, resists, stuns and ignores. Can he get by in society with that behavior? He's quite hard headed about that."
