    "overview": "In one of his finest dramatic performances yet, Louis Koo stars as a veteran ambulanceman who simply wants to do his job without any interference from his boss. While he considers emigrating with his daughter, he clashes with his new partner, a young go-getter on the fast-track up the bureaucratic ladder. A mature directorial effort by Cheuk Wan-chi, this dramedy about Hong Kong’s civil service culture and the latest emigration wave is a charming,  yet sobering love letter to her city and its people, especially those who still remain."
