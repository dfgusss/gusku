    "overview": "Mudos testigos is a cinematographic collage made from all the surviving material of Colombian silent films, re-editing the images in such a way as to create a single imaginary film: the impossible love story of Efraín and Alicia that traces the convulsive first half of the twentieth century in Colombia.  Compiled by the late Luis Ospina and finished posthumously by Jeronimo Atehortúa."
