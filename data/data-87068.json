    "overview": "Jenny is a gold digger who buys luxury goods with conned money. She runs away to a village in Mt. Jirisan and learns of a thousand-year-old wild ginseng wine that is rumored to be a cure-all. Jenny thinks stealing it from the ailing grandfather and grandson will be a piece of cake. However, from the moment she encounters Doen-jang, the boy who swings a hoe and does strange dances, things spiral out of control."
