    "overview": "In the world of camel racing, Ghanim is preparing for the Great Race of Safwa.  His younger brother, Matar, grew up hearing these poems about their legendary grandfather, known only as \"Hajjan,\" the Arabic word for jockey. But as he follows in his grandfather's footsteps, in a regional qualifying race, foul play interrupts Ghanim's dreams.  Matar realizes that the only chance to save himself and his inseparable camel Hofir is to also become a \"Hajjan\", and enter the world of Bedouin camel racing — where heroes are made."
