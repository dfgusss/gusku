    "overview": "Two love stories, decades apart, unfold by two iconic bridges—one in the misty hills of Munnar in 1970, the other beneath the bustling skyline of London in 2024. As hearts meet near the Hanging Bridge and the London Bridge, fate weaves an unexpected connection between the past and present, revealing that love, no matter the era, always finds a way across time."
