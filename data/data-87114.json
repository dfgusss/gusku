    "overview": "Lucia and Paolo are two 30-something actors who have been together for many years. Their relationship, much like their careers, has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs—lately, more downs than ups. To reignite both their love life and their shot at fame, they decide to participate in a reality show where they must each recount their love story separately. They make a pact: they will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. But is their version of the truth the same? Will this experience bring them closer together or tear them apart for good?"
