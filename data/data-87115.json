Three years after the loss of Isma, his best friend and mentor, Anis takes his courage in both hands and decides finally to get out and meet people again. And the person he meets is Madeleine. Thinking she’s way out of his league, Anis gets tangled in a web of silly lies trying to impress her. But something huge is about to start. An unexpected thing. A thing called love."
