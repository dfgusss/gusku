    "overview": "Christina acts as a modern art exhibition organizer, but in reality, she organizes entertainment for wealthy clients in the most exotic locations. Dozens of elite girls from all over the world work for her. Once in the past, Christina also worked as a hostess at such parties, but, being very ambitious, a few years ago she completely changed her image, and became an extra-class manager. But this work also has a downside - the constant presence of crime, police and special services, as well as disruptions and intrigues of girls trying to tear off a bigger piece of the pie."
