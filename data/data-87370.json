    "overview": "Hazel Miller is a top publicist in New York City looking to build her empire. Diego Vasquez is a top MLB pitcher for the New York Mets who froze during Game 7 of the World Series. He also happens to be the guy who shattered Hazel’s heart in high school. When Hazel is tasked with spinning Diego's image, it might be her biggest challenge professionally, and personally, as she takes him back to their hometown in Ohio to deal with what they’ve both left behind."
