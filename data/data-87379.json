    "overview": "It's Oscar's first day of working at Bradbury Asylum, where the helter skelter patients are killing each other - when the staff aren't trying to first. He reports to Dr. Isaac Cole who has taken a keen interest in Angelica Zacherly, survivor of the East Willard massacre. If the holidays weren't stressful enough, not one but two Santa-clad slashers have arrived on the scene with opposing motives. From padded walls to splattered doors, Oscar's about to learn that minimum wage can be murder."
