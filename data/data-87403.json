    "overview": "From Oscar-winning filmmakers Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy Chin, \"Wild Life\" follows conservationist Kris Tompkins on an epic, decades-spanning love story as wild as the landscapes she dedicated her life to protecting. After falling in love in mid-life, Kris and the outdoorsman and entrepreneur Doug Tompkins left behind the world of the massively successful outdoor brands they'd helped pioneer like Patagonia, The North Face, and Esprit, and turned their attention to a visionary effort to create National Parks throughout Chile and Argentina. \"Wild Life\" chronicles the highs and lows of their journey to effect the largest private land donation in history."
