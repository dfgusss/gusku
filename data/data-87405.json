    "overview": "She is a tactical submarine officer. He is a steward. Before diving for 90 days she chooses to make it her \"four-hour\". But here he is clinging. Who follows her. Who sticks it. Where do we go if the flight crew of a 747 prides itself on romance? As if we had time to be in love on board a military ship. Still, the Pacific Ocean is not big enough. Neither does the Arctic Ocean. The world is so small when you love each other so much."
