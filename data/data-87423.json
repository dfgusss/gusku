    "overview": "George Orwell was one of the most visionary authors of the 20th Century, whose novels, 1984 and Animal Farm, foretold a chilling, authoritarian future. Acclaimed director Raoul Peck interweaves clips, readings from Orwell's diary, cinematic references, and modern-day footage to craft not only a portrait of the writer, but a fresh take on how prophetic his work has become."
