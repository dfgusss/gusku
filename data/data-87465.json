    "overview": "Ayoub is a rather old man , decides to re-marry, after 40 years married life with Shamsi, who is lost suspiciously. However, not a single member of the family can accept such marriage. Nevertheless, Ayoub is very much determined to re-marry, in spite of all objections. No one has any idea who is the bride? She's Roya, the family young servant/nurse who was taking care of Ayoub's disabled young boy and then fired by Shamsi, now the lost wife! Anyone's question is what is the relation between Shamsi's sudden disappearance and Roya's returning as the new bride of Ayoub."
