    "overview": "The soothing pace of the film shows a woman's journey to reinvent herself, as Anna serves 15 years for a murder she committed as a teenager, and although her sentence has expired, the strange looks around her mean that her trial is not yet over. Anna travels far from home to a small town and finds a job, ready to start a new life, but she still struggles with closure, fear, prejudice, and the black holes left by the old days that she must fill herself."
