    "overview": "A special from Lizzy Hoo about life, family and following your dreams, but only if they're worth it. With tales about her former office life, her brother’s backyard trout-farming dreams, and father-daughter trips to Malaysia with her larger-than-life father Chan. Lizzy's show is an hour of big laughs and good times from a comedian whose profile has exploded in a few short years."
