    "overview": "Marco, Guido, Leo, Luisa, Gaelle and Mattia have different mothers, they are not all biological children of the same father but they have a single true father figure of reference: Manfredi Alicante. When the latter passes away, they all find themselves together for the first time in their father's house in Bordeaux, living the illusion of being able to become a united family. But now each of them brings with them a story, an identity and going back won't be easy."
