    "overview": "Andre Ward's journey from the streets of Oakland to the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Facing an all-too familiar series of obstacles including substance abuse, the loss of a parent, drug dealing and teen pregnancy, how Ward faced that adversity is what separates him from the rest. Fight after fight he defied the odds and silenced his critics. And then, guided by faith and devotion, he walked away - choosing his role as a father and a husband over his boxing career."
