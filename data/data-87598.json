    "overview": "Confined to his Tahitian hut by the French colonial  authorities in 1903, the painter Paul Gauguin is forced  to paint a new masterpiece to save his five-year-old  native son, while battling illness and torn between  madness and sanity. In the course of these events,  memories of the past, especially of his life and work at  the Panama Canal, the place where his artistic career  began and his guilt at abandoning his family in Paris,  begin to haunt him."
