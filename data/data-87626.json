    "overview": "Chantal is at the beginning of her career as an influencer when she steps through a mirror and finds herself in a fairy tale. She identifies as Sleeping Beauty. Her best friend Zeynep follows her through the mirror. Chantal’s goal, naturally, is to find a man, definitely a prince. Perhaps she will marry Prince Bosco. She already has a wedding gown, but he seems more interested in men. Her friend, Aladdin (Mido Kotaini), has a magic lamp; he rubs it, and people appear. She works to finish making a flying carpet. There is a wicked witch, Sansara, who sometimes looks old but often young. Her friend Zeynep ends up in a grave but reappears. An elderly rather fat fairy pops up occasionally. Chantal must fight a dragon."
