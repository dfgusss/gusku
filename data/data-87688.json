    "overview": "Fathia and Reyhan are reunited as adults. However, for the sake of her adherence to religion, Fathia decided to stay away from Reyhan.  However, ironically, this separation actually brought Fathia, who had memorized the Koran, to face a bitter reality. She had to accept marriage to an older man who was already married in order to help the family financially."
