    "overview": "The day Liao was discharged from prison with his maimed right hand was also the day Nan was forced to retire. Nan will no longer be the head of CIB, just as Liao will no longer be a pickpocket. Liao wants to find the young pickpocket who called him “Daddy” back then, while Nan misses his daughter badly, who hated him profoundly and was unwilling to forgive him. So the two desperate old fellows start trying to find their last hope."
