    "overview": "It is winter in Gdynia, Poland. This is Kasia's town, a rebellious teenager: headstrong, fearless, and streetwise. When Kasia was 3 years old, her parents left Poland, hoping for a better life in Germany. They never returned and Kasia grew up with her grandmother. When her grandmother passes away, Kasia is heartstruck. To top it all off, she also seems to be pregnant."
