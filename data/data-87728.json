    "overview": "Ava, a sharp Gen Z teen in suburban Malibu, feels invisible amid her celebrity parents, Greyson and Zoe (Jason Priestley and Mena Suvari). She connects with Cameron, a grieving Afghan-American teen who is secretly gay. Both disillusioned, they bond over their shared love of filmmaking. When tragedy strikes their friendship, the blame lands on Ava’s father’s controversial sci-fi film—upending their lives. As Ava and Cameron grapple with grief, sexuality, and the burden of creative perception, they forge an unexpected alliance in the search for truth and identity until the tragedy strikes."
