    "overview": "Martín always wanted to be a film director, but until now he has not been able to fulfill his dream. After living in Madrid for a while, he returns to his native Mallorca to teach a course on the seventh art. His five students will give him back the hope he lost a long time ago and together they will join forces and passion to start a joint project. A priori insignificant course, but one that will change the lives of all of them."
