    "overview": "Passionate about sailing, Jean-Paul is going through a rough patch. Up to his ears in debts, he pulls away from his family. Determined to take his life back in hand, he signs up for Virtual Regatta, the online version of Vendée Globe boat race. To enhance his impression of being a “real” skipper, Jean-Paul holes up for 3 months on his boat in his garden. His voyage, unlike any other, will allow him to reconnect with his family and, even more, with himself."
