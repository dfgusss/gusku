    "overview": "Navigating both the criminal underworld and law enforcement agencies, professional snitches called \"yadang\" provide covert information about the drug world to prosecutors and police. When a drug bust at a party attended by high-profile second-generation VIPs entangles those involved into a dangerous conspiracy, a seasoned yadang must do everything in his power not just to make it out on top, but alive."
