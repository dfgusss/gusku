    "overview": "A fever dream of the faces of love.  Six circles of love.  A kind of death and rebirth experienced within each circle.  Each song in the short film evokes a realm of what love can feel like to a human being, the metamorphosis through the experience of Love.  Faced with the person that was at every metamorphosis, there is a certain death, and certain transformation.  We watch her move without words towards salvation."
