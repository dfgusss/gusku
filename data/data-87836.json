She has raised her younger sister, Umeko and has reached this age without a single happy memory of love or fun. In addition, Sakurako has a very poor appearance, and children in the neighborhood make fun of her, calling her \"Frankenwoman,\" which makes her despicable to others.  While taking care of Tamura, a wealthy old man she is visiting, Sakurako meets a handsome boy named Ryuji. Sakurako falls in love with him at first sight.
