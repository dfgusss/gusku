However, things are complicated by the fact that Tommi is easily fooled and the money from the old apartment, more than half a million euros, disappears in a pyramid scheme. When Tommi is in danger of losing Harriet for good, his loyal friend Juhis takes the reins. Juhis plans a rescue operation that kind of works."
