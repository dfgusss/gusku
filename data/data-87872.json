    "overview": "Fiona, a tenancy lawyer from the big city, wants to spend a weekend in the Black Forest with her boyfriend. He is having fun with business partners on the golf course, she is taking part in a wellness program. When a fallen tree blocks the road to the hotel, the young woman comes into contact with grumpy logger Sascha and finds shelter on Josef and Marlies' farm. What Fiona experiences there makes her think about her life. What's more, she suddenly feels attracted to the taciturn woodcutter."
