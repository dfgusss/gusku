    "overview": "Born from the ashes of the iconic punk band Ebba Grön, this documentary tells the story of Imperiet and their journey to become the leading star of the post-punk generation and one of Sweden's biggest rock bands. It's also the story of Sweden, at a time in which they took their firm position on the world stage and when political commitment from the artists was a necessity."
