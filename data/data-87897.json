    "overview": "Jim Bouton's 1970 book \"Ball Four\" was groundbreaking, shocking, and controversial. It sold in the millions. 40 years later, Bouton and former teammates spin hilarious stories from behind baseball's cloistered clubhouses, giving a rare glimpse inside Major League baseball in the 1960s. The book's cultural impact is examined by filmmaker and former pro baseball player Ron Shelton (\"Bull Durham\"), author Jean Hastings Ardell, and David Kipen, former director of literature for the NEA."
