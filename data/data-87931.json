    "overview": "From Pouziou les Trois Galoches to the Isle of Beauty, it’s just a step… Invested with a supernatural power transmitted by the ghost of his father, Christian foresees a future murder in a premonitory dream. A certain Pasqualini, a clementine producer in the Aléria region, will be assassinated in seven days. But how to apprehend the murderer of a dead man who is not dead? Thanks to the legendary common sense and tyrannical nature of Maria, ready to annoy all the Corsicans to save one, and the rare flashes of genius from her big oaf of a son Christian. It’s just as well if, in the process, they have to immerse themselves in local customs, disguise themselves as bandits, try Corsican polyphonies, or force Christian to eat brocciu."
