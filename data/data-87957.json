    "overview": "Once an Olympic medalist in archery but now the top target for restructuring, Jin-bong heads to the Amazon to seize one last chance offered by his company. After barely surviving a life-threatening ordeal, Jin-bong arrives in the Amazon, where he meets three warriors with god-given archery skills: Sika, Eba, and Walbu! Believing he has found a way to save himself, Jin-bong teams up with Bbang-sik, a Korean-Bolédorian interpreter, and brings the three archery masters to Korea… Now, Jin-bong’s comeback depends entirely on the Amazon trio!"
