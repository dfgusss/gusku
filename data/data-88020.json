    "overview": "July 23, 2018. An important date for ex-FEMEN leader Oxana Chatchko - the opening of her exhibition of blasphemous icons. So begins a day of wandering across Paris. Amidst encounters with lovers and an art critic, and an appointment to confirm her political refugee status, memories of her past as a feminist activist, and the traumas and betrayals suffered during her fight, resurface. Can she reawaken her desire to live?"
