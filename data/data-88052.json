    "overview": "Gump's new journey begins exactly where the previous one ended. Together with his beloved Béďa Kozí Bobek, the main animal hero goes through a story that was written for them long ago by the stars. And while Gump's first story was sadder, in its loose sequel entitled Gump – We Are a Pair, viewers can look forward to lots of funny animal scenes. Alongside the main character, a new character will appear, Jenny the dog, who will play Gump's sister Kytička."
