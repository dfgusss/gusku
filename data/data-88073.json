    "overview": "In a fading North Calcutta Rajbari, Titli clings to routine after her husband Shaon vanishes. As Durga Puja nears, Megh arrives, an unexpected guest who brings warmth and a painful revel of thought. Amid rituals and memories, unspoken grief surfaces, stirring buried emotions, silent longing, and the ache of unfinished stories."
