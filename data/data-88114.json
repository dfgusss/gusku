Apparently, the Caucasian relatives of the Russified Ossetian thought so when they decided to help him, following the ancient tradition, to ride his St. Petersburg bride to the village. But what if, in the end, the wrong bride ends up in the car, the family learns David's main secret, and for all the guests who have gathered, the wedding will still need to be held? Then \"Caucasian Bollywood\" will come."
