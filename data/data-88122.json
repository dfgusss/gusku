    "overview": "Salvo, a Sicilian fisherman, is devastated by the tragic death at sea of his child during a bath at the \"glass beach\" and to escape the unbearable pain he leaves his village and goes to work far away as a offshore welder on an oil platform. When he receives news of his father’s stroke, he returns to Sicily to sell his father’s house with the idea of using the proceeds to obtain shared custody of his daughter in Calabria. But here his life will change again thanks to the activities of the catwalks that cross the Strait and the presence of people and unexpected affections, in the landscape of the coasts and villages of Messina and Villa San Giovanni."
