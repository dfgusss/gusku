    "overview": "30 years ago, Titi and Dirwan appeared at a small town and took over a rundown mansion where they turned it into a quaint and idyllic home for the homeless and those who have nowhere to go. It has created a buzz among the small community and nearby towns especially when Dirwan has never demanded for any payments and he has taken great efforts and measures to provide the best care and facilities for the residents. Unknown to everyone, the shelter home is only the front for another ludicrous but dark and sinister business. Business that Titi and Dirwan have been profiting for close to 2 decades. Its charming facade and warm hospitality lure unsuspecting victims. This place is perfect as it is located at the edge of the town, far away from anyone and coupled with unreliable internet and mobile phone services."
