    "overview": "This scenic documentary attempts to reconstruct the last days of Jesus Christ - from his arrival in Jerusalem to his death on the cross. But what is faith and what is historical? The narrative begins with the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem with a small group of followers, continues with the scandal in the temple, the provocation of the Jewish rulers, the trial before the Roman prefect and the execution of the sentence."
