As Mr. Heller’s mentorship turns to dangerous obsession, Clara uncovers his horrifying secret identity and murderous past. Now trapped in a psychological game with a predator who’s eliminated anyone standing in his way, Clara must use her understanding of Heller’s twisted psychology against him before she becomes his next victim. Some lessons are worth dying for – others are worth killing for."
