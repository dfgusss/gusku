    "overview": "Ellen believes she has the perfect life. When her new husband, Paul, isn’t traveling on business, he dotes on her and her daughter. But after a stranger is caught prowling around their house, things don’t add up. Why is Paul always away on business? And did he know the prowler? It's as if something, or someone, is taking over his priorities. Ellen begins to discover a web of lies that she must expose to in order to free herself and her daughter. That is, if Paul doesn’t stop her first."
