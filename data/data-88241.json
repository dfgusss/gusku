    "overview": "In 1973, after Pinochet's coup, Chile was one of the most dangerous places in the world. The only apparently safe place was the embassies. The film is based on real accounts by João Carlos Bona Garcia who spent 42 days inside the Embassy in these conditions “of not knowing if he would be alive the next day” and survived."
