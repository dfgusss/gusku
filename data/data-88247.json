He claims to be the sole heir, but someone is living in the supposedly uninhabited house: Clara Mensen. Together with her friend Valeska, she tries everything to prevent the sale. Also because Mayor Flasskamp wants to close the deal with Kühn very quickly. He already owns the neighboring property and could finally implement his plans for a large hotel. But the two have made their plan without Clara Mensen. She discovers Kühn's true identity. And Kühn learns a secret about Clara Mensen. The two rivals suddenly have to work together to save their own skins."
