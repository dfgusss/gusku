    "overview": "From the music of Hungarian composer Mihály Vig , Georgian filmmaker Koberidze, Alexandre crafts a story of pixelated dogs on a ledge. This short film is part of the 2x25 Project of Film Fest Gent and the World Soundtrack Awards. The project commissioned 25 composers to compose a short piece of music, after which 25 filmmakers made short films that are the ultimate symbioses of music and cinematography, fitting completely within the DNA of the festival. The result: 25 exceptional films where the music inspired the form, narrative and texture."
