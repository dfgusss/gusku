    "overview": "Being Romanian: A Family Journal is the story of millions of Romanians who, through various circumstances, have ended up living between these borders and having to stand each other: just the way things happen in every large family. This is a journey through space and time, where family bridges the gap between every moment that has united us or torn us apart during the last 100 years since the Great Union that marked the birth of modern Romania."
