Even Helene is there, as she hopes to use the footage of the performance to build up her influencer channel. What nobody knows is that Helene's family is on the verge of bankruptcy and Helene urgently needs followers to avert the threat of bankruptcy. Helene is also under pressure from the high expectations of her magical animal, Karajan the cat from Paris, who imagines a life of pure luxury."
