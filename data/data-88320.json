    "overview": "Edu, a senior pilot who serves pioneering routes in Papua, received a special assignment from Simon, the owner of the airline company. Edu was promised to lead Simon's subsidiary, if he was able to establish a youth football club which they would sponsor, by recruiting young Papuan talents. Edu then met John, the coach who had just won a gold medal at the national football event. John responded pessimistically to Edu's plan, because his team had split up and returned to their respective lives. Edu realized that pessimism was the biggest challenge he had to face."
