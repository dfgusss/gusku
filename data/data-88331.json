    "overview": "When a fortuneteller predicted Lisa's death on August 15 in midst of fear and violence, she shrugged. Yet, this morning, as the sun rises over a deserted and heat-scorched city, the police is desperate. The killer of three women will strike again by midnight. Suddenly Lisa feels less serene. Especially since she is sure, a man has broken into the empty building. August 15th will be a very hot day…."
