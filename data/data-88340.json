    "overview": "Luana shares a common situation with her father, Fábio: lack of luck in love. Since his wife's death, he has been unable to get into any serious relationship and finding an ideal girlfriend seems to be an increasingly distant dream. However, everything changes when he falls in love with a co-worker and starts making plans to live with her. What seemed like an idea a little out of the question, ends up becoming a new path, full of new obstacles, patience, love and complicity for both, as Fábio's friend is nothing more, nothing less, than Antônia, Fábio's mother. Hugh."
