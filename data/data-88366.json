    "overview": "To mark his recent appointment, the new Pope prepares for a tour of Latin America, only to find that the Vatican is bankrupt. A rich Mexican woman offers to help out. In return for financing his trip, she demands he attends an event in his honour in the city of Ciudad Juarez – Mexico’s capital of crime. The “guardian angel” turns out to be a drug trafficker, and when she discovers that a lookalike Pope has been sent in his place, confusion, laughter and unexpected chaos ensue."
