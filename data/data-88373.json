    "overview": "Set in the Cloudy Falls residence, a run-down apartment complex in Niagara Falls that seems destined to be torn down, the film tells the story of a handful of its tenants, chosen randomly by the narrator, Rita, the building’s glib superintendent. They include Terry, an uptight, middle-aged gay man who grows enamoured of the erratic, young drifter squatting next door; Brigit, a spiritual debunker who exposes psychic frauds on her little-seen YouTube channel; Riley, a compulsive liar whose many tall tales are starting to catch up to her; and the collection of neighbours who surround them."
