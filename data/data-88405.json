    "overview": "Tai is the middle-aged owner of an Internet cafe, but unfortunately, it’s not doing so well. It’s mostly empty, especially because, as his landlord points out, kids play games on their phones nowadays. He decides to participate in the Hong Kong One Shot Esports tournament and hopefully win the grand-prize money to save his business. To qualify, he needs to be part of a team, so he recruits Solo, a recently fired esports player facing a decline in his career; Fay, who started working at Tai’s Internet cafe after not lasting long at her previous jobs; and former movie star Octo, who plays games with his elderly wife to help her exercise her brain and fight the degeneration process. Together, they call themselves Happy Hour, and they’ll combine their strengths in gaming to win this fierce competition. It ain’t over till it’s game over!"
