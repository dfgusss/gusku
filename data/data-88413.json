Legendary street dancer DeRay and spoken-word poet and battle rapper Naima explore a powerful love built on recognition and trauma that contains both the potential for inspiration and destruction.  Take an electrifying journey through the vibrant and impressionistic experience of their relationship to each other and through their own creative personal voyages in this hip-hop fantasia that opens a door into the choices we all make in our lives."
