    "overview": "Jung-seo, who is planning on getting married, wins an apartment subscription, which is almost like winning a lottery. Not being able to pay the deposit, she makes a begrudging visit to her father for money, who had divorced her mother without paying any alimony. But when she meets his new family, everything gets messed up due to different desires of each of them. In the unexpected chaos, Jung-seo gradually faces what they really want, and most importantly, what she wants deep inside herself."
