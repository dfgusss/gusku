    "overview": "Chloe and Alessandro are two 30-year-old, longtime friends living together in a large apartment. Chloe works for a culinary recipe publisher, while Alessandro is an up-and-coming painter. Although their friendship is strong, they have very different approaches to relationships. Chloe is constantly searching for her Prince Charming, while Alessandro, living openly as a gay man in a small town, navigates life with maturity despite the challenges. Their dynamic shifts when Roberto enters their lives. The three become inseparable, each learning from the others: Roberto sheds his bigotry, Chloe finally finds happiness, and Alessandro is content seeing them both fulfilled. But their balance is tested when Chloe finds out she’s pregnant."
