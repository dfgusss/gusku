    "overview": "Marco is an anxious nineteen-year-old approaching his final exams, with three subjects to catch up on, a mother glued to her smartphone, and a brother who dreams of becoming an indie singer. He is antisocial and wishes he could love the way people used to. Aria graduated the previous year, has *one day at a time* tattooed on her arm, and lives every day as if it were her last."
