    "overview": "César and Teresa are a happy couple until one night she sleeps with Coque Malla, César's great idol since his adolescence. Teresa confesses it to César, repentant, but he doesn't know how to react. Is being unfaithful with your erotic myth excusable? Teresa has not slept with her idol, but with Caesar's. And there is no current legislation on that. César needs to talk to Coque, even though the singer no longer lives in Spain. So the couple travels to Miami in search of him, while they rethink their 15-year relationship and their own lives."
