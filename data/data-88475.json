    "overview": "One script, two screenwriters, three revisions, four seasons change, five flavors mixed. According to legend, during the early years of the Ming Dynasty, General Chang Yuchun headed north with his army and established a campsite that later became known as \"Chang Ying.\" Several hundred years later, a group of young people also stationed there, dreaming of becoming directors, screenwriters, actors, producers, and more. Among them were two screenwriters, Zhang Liao and Sun Tan. They wrote a movie script that they believed would go down in history and were determined to bring it to the big screen."
