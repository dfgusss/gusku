Isolated, vulnerable, and in need of friends, she finds brief solace in the company of two local teens. But when she becomes complicit to their unforgivable act of violence, she finds herself ensnared by Mr. Sandman – the twisted soul of a tormented child who haunts bullies’ dreams before feasting on their eyeballs when they finally wake - Anna must right her wrong before becoming a victim of this gruesome curse."
