    "overview": "When the Rebolledo accountants' children finally leave their home, their lonely parents, feeling abandoned, come up with the crazy plan to win the lottery in order to regain the interest of  Pali and Marcelo. Posing as millionaires works wonders, so much so that their children give up their personal ventures in order to be close to them. But things get out of control when they demand the same luxuries."
