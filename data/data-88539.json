    "overview": "31-year old Ilja Felder works in crisis intervention. When assessing a bereaved mother after her son committed suicide, Ilja struggles, but refuses to admit his weakness to himself and his supervisor Nadia. Soon he drives out to his first unaccompanied assignment - a road accident during a stormy night. When the accident perpetrator turns out to be suicidal, Ilja completely loses his nerves and almost makes a fatal mistake. As a result, he finally has to acknowledge that he can no longer ignore his past."
