    "overview": "Moon loves penguins. Her lifelong ambition is to study penguins in Antarctica. She believes she’ll meet her destined mate just like penguins do. One day, Moon runs into Adley, a guy in a penguin suit fortuitously making penguin courtship gestures at her. She believes the penguin-scented Adley is her fate. As they spend time together, Adley is moved by Moon's genuineness and passion. Just when their relationship has made some progress, Moon is recommended for an exchange program to the UK, throwing Moon into a dilemma between pursuing love and her dream."
