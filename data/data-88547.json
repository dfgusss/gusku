    "overview": "Steve Baker is a night watchman who's in his early 20's but his life is already getting away from him. His band is falling apart, he owes a ton of money for drugs, and he's in love with his best friend's girl. When Marty Lyons comes along and ropes Steve into a criminal world of oddballs, misfits, and lost souls that are as dirty as the Charles River, Steve wonders if this is a change for the better or if he's about to make the worst decision of his life."
