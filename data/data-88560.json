For someone who was not blessed with a warm affectionate family, this was what she had always dreamed of. However, one day while Hagino is out, she receives a call from Moeka asking for her help. She rushes home and finds her house turned upside down, Moeka's clothes torn to shreds and a strange young girl is standing over her, with a pair of scissors in her hand."
