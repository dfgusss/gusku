    "overview": "In a shabby bar outside Paris, in the early hours of the morning, a few customers are having a last drink or a first coffee, when out of nowhere one of the regulars wins the €294 million lottery. But another customer decides otherwise: a gun is drawn, shots are fired and the winner collapses, leaving the ticket ownerless. The remaining customers lock themselves behind closed doors, and see an opportunity to concoct the perfect story to cover up the crime, then all walk away millionaires. But as unforeseen events conspire against them, their temptation sends them all on a bloody downward spiral."
