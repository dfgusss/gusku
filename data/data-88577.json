    "overview": "Mrs Foster, a retired lady whose cup is half empty, is starting chemotherapy and is understandably anxious. The last thing she needs, is to have to share the treatment room with a 'know it all child' who wants to grow up to be a lesbian. But through their unexpected friendship, Maisy Jones gives Mrs Foster much more than just a glimmer of hope."
