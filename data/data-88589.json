    "overview": "During the production of the play based on Aristophanes’ „Birds” the three artist friends face the painful truth about themselves. Someone regrets abandoning someone. Someone seduces the director of the play, because they believe in polyamory. Somebody thinks that the war has never ended and one must never surrender. Someone else claims that it’s all about how you fall and you should know how to drop. And in the meantime, somebody decides to express an unusual declaration of love."
