    "overview": "METRALLA was a rock group from the late 1980s that achieved great success with its first and only LP titled “Por Tus Muertos”, but which mysteriously dissolved just before giving its first concert. Thirty years later, Miguel, one of the members of the band, still dreams of being a rock star, even though no one goes to his concerts and his music store is about to be seized by the bank. Ordúñez, a famous rock radio communicator, offers him to give a concert at the Palace of Madrid on the condition that he reunites the original members of the band."
