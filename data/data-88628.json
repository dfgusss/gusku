After the existence of the Helang in ESLM, the NTSF is increasingly threatened when the Helang try to destroy their organization. Fadli began to investigate and suspected the NTSF of having spies who leaked their information. Fadli begins to distrust anyone until he discovers the truth within his own organization.
