    "overview": "The brownie escapes from the captivity of Baba Yaga in her magical world, and ends up in the apartment of the girl Natasha and her parents. Kuzya needs to find his magic chest that grants wishes. Both Natasha and the local grumpy brownie Nafanya help him in this. It turns out that Kuzya himself gave the chest to Andrey, Natasha's dad, many years ago. It would seem that the goal is already close, but in search of both Kuzya and the chest, Baba Yaga entered our world, and she has her own insidious plans."
