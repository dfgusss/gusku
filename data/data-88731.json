He’ll rather spend his time with his friends and Checkered Ninja feels he is overlooked and is eager to engage in a new mission. The result of this is that Alex, by accident, ends up having a conflict with Marco, the bad boy boyfriend of Jessica, entangling him in a conflict he hasn’t asked for and he is pressured by Checkered Ninja to defend himself."
