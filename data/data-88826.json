    "overview": "On TJ's 18th birthday, a stranger delivers him a key from his father, last seen as he was hauled off to prison eight years earlier. With the key is an address for a proposed meeting – 3000 miles away and in two weeks. The key unlocks a timeworn 1968 convertible, with a coffin welded to its floor. With each decision that follows, TJ plunges deeper into the mysterious and beautiful landscapes we all navigate – on our own, with our tribe, through the shifting turns of the road ahead."
