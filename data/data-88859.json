    "overview": "A financially struggling couple starts livestreaming themselves when a gunshot rings out and they find their next-door neighbor is murdered. To find the killer, they invite the other residents of the building over to probe for clues over cocktails, a different cocktail for each invitee. It gets even more complicated when a second body is found. No one is safe, and no one can be trusted as they try to unravel the mystery."
