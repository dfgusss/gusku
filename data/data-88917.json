    "overview": "Before there was Future, Lil Yachty, Tekashi69, Lil Pump, or Kodak Black, there was Young Guttah Nutz. \"MUMBLE: Fate of a Lost Icon\" is a mockumentary about the rise, fall, and omission of Young Guttah Nutz, the creator of mumble rap. Growing up as a poor inner city youth, he hit the streets as a teen, dealing drugs and pursuing music until he met who would become his manager, Ed O'paque, leading Guttah Nutz to record a song that would change the course of the music industry forever."
