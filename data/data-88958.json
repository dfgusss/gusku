A hundred years later, in Lanling City, the kind and innocent girl Ling Yun is waiting for her lover to propose marriage, but instead she is betrayed by her father and abandoned by her lover. Under immense resentment, Ling Yun's blood tears the seal apart. The released Hua Yuan possesses Ling Yun and establishes the \"Eastern Women City\" with eight other fox demons. In order to completely break free of Lingyun's body, Hua Yuan sets his sights on the seven-orifice Linglong Heart of scholar Xu Wenliang. In order to make Xu Wenliang voluntarily offer his heart, Hua Yuan and her fox demons set multiple traps for him."
