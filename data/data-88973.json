    "overview": "Lok is the Chief Investigation Director of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). Ordered by his superior to set up a special team to investigate a corruption case involving a bank's senior executive using cryptocurrency to tamper with the trading market, Lok approaches the cryptocurrency's trading platform software designer Xin for help, hoping to gather evidence internally. During the investigation process, ICAC discovers the bank's finances in ruins, and identifies the suspect as bank executive, Toh. When the chairman of the bank is kidnapped and the ransom demanded is in the form of the crypto coin related to the market tampering, Lok becomes more convinced there is more than meets the eye. When the commercial crime evolves into a criminal case, ICAC vows to bring in the mastermind."
