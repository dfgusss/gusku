    "overview": "In southeastern Turkey, Kurds who want to live their lives in peace are squeezed between the harassment of Turkish military patrols and the demands of the PKK guerrillas, all while land and pasture are scarce. Ciwan is the village chief, a righteous and humble family man. Day in and day out, he rushes through his village duties and tending to his livestock. Two steps behind him is his 14-year-old son Feyzi, wondering why he has to learn everything right now. What he doesn't know is that his father is seriously ill and time is running out."
