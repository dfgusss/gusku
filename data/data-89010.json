    "overview": "Omer and Carine move restlessly from place to place and keep their heads above water with tournaments at the pool table. Both are on the run from their past: Omer as an African refugee, Frenchwoman Carine as an ex-junkie who was in danger of sinking into the drug scene. Now the couple have ended up in Berlin, where Omer senses a big coup: he wants to challenge the notorious billiards player Sultan to a tournament. With the winnings from this match, he and Carine could finally move on and perhaps even fulfill Carine's dream of opening a beach bar. But things turn out differently, because the shady Sultan has also devised a plan to pull the wool over Omer's eyes."
