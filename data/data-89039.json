    "overview": "After the brutal massacre by the Palestinian terrorist group Hamas in Israel on October 7, 2023, the worst act of bloodshed against Jews since World War II, anti-Semitism has reached a new qualitative dimension worldwide, including in Germany: arson attacks on synagogues, Star of David markings on front doors, graffiti on Holocaust memorials, well-attended demonstrations with anti-Israel slogans and shouts of \"get out of here\" at German universities by supposedly left-wing extremists, whose blatant threatening gestures and threats of annihilation are more reminiscent of the views of their Nazi grandfathers. Where is the state taking consistent action against such hostilities and where is the loud protest from the middle of society? Is Jewish life still safe in Germany? The documentary film has followed four German Jews in their fight against hatred over the last three months since the massacre and lets them report on their experiences."
