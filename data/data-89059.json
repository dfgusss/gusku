    "overview": "When four student filmmakers are paid half-a-million dollars to look for ghosts on Boney Island, they assume it'll be the easiest weekend of their lives. All except Madeleine, whose belief in ghosts puts her in direct conflict with the other skeptical slackers. It doesn't take long for the others wonder if it'd be easier (and more lucrative) to oust her out of the project. But as tensions and temptations of greed boil over, a paranormal presence, unseen and unnoticed, begins to grow stronger and stronger, forcing the group to violently and brutally confront their own disbelief, one way or the other."
