    "overview": "Far from being a film about life in the gangs of Medellín, El Bolero de Rubén is a tragedy set to the rhythm of boleros where Marta, after fifteen years of waiting for her boyfriend to get out of jail, is consumed by the walls of her half-finished house; at the same time, her dream of becoming a singer takes her through imaginary places that reflect her frustration, rage and fear. Based on the homonymous play."
