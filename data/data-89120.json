    "overview": "An interstellar spacecraft was accidentally trapped in the Stargate Abyss. Only 4 of the 15 passengers were able to enter the hibernation cabin and get a chance to survive. Faced with precious survival quota, some people release the imprisoned alien monsters and attempt to massacre others by manipulating the monsters; others desperately resist the monsters, sacrificing their own lives to save more people. In this dark abyss, a just battle is beginning."
