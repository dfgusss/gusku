    "overview": "'Thank God for the Gift' tells the story of Jan Hoet, one of the most striking figures from recent Belgium art history. The film shows the remarkable career of the top curator, but even more so the remarkable person he was. A passionate man with an unquenchable thirst for art, radical in his honesty and in his pursuit of total intellectual and emotional freedom."
