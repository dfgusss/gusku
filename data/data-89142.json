    "overview": "During the Northern Expedition of Yongxi in the early Song Dynasty, General Yang Ye heroically sacrificed himself, and his posthumous reward, the Nine-Ring Golden Dagger, fell into Liao territory. A decade later, his daughters, Yang Baba and Yang Jiumei, set out to reclaim it, facing relentless dangers. On their return, they ally with Jiao Guangpu, a former soldier of Yang Ye. Together, they outwit and overcome three enemy attacks, ensuring the dagger’s safe return to Song lands."
