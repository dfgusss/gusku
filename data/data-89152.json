    "overview": "The 67-year-old Edgar is the most successful elderly comedian in Germany. Every evening on stage, he makes fun of everything that concerns older people: failed relationships, ungrateful children, a declining libido, rapidly deteriorating health, general uselessness and imminent death. But as soon as the show is over, what's left is a man who is really lonely and tries to fill his empty evenings with groupies and alcohol. When, after 25 years, he meets his ex-wife Eva again, who is terminally ill with cancer, the two begin to fall in love again against all odds and Eva decides to accompany Edgar on his comedy tour through Germany and Austria..."
