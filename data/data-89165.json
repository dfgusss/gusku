A special concert will be held to bring out the charm of Kanato Tsukishiro, the top star of Tsukigumi, who has overwhelming expressiveness and singing ability. This time, we welcome Satoshi Mitsui, who is active not only as a choreographer but also as a director, to explore new possibilities for Tsukigumi members centered on Tsukishiro. Enjoy the finest entertainment to mark the beginning of 2024, the 110th anniversary of Takarazuka Revue."
