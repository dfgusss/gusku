    "overview": "Wolf, born into a deaf family, embraces sign language with confidence despite obstacles in life; Sophie, having received a cochlear implant at a young age, continuously strives to be seen as \"normal\" despite having a \"deaf accent.\" Alan, with a cochlear implant like Sophie, is capable of both spoken language and sign language; he advocates for diverse modes of communication within the deaf community. Bound by love and friendship, the three embark on a self-discovering journey that is not without its moments of pain."
