    "overview": "A college ladies man accepts a challenge from his dorm buddies - sleep with the entire alphabet, A through Z, before graduation. The rules are simple: the rarer the first letter of the girl's last name, the higher the payout. All goes well until he falls for the \"X\". Now he's torn between his feelings for the girl and winning the bet for his friends."
