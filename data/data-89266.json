Accompanied by his childhood friend Cheng Shuang and his grandmother, Liu XIII spends a peaceful time. He follows the traces left by his ancestors, listens carefully to the breath of the town, and gradually comes out of his past confusion at the kiosk where he can reach out and touch the clouds, between the mountains and the sea, and under the osmanthus tree in the courtyard. Some people are engraved in their bones and forgotten within a few years. There are some people who will stay by your side no matter if they live or die."
