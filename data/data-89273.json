    "overview": "The Can, a steel shipping container housing a site office, stands alone in an isolated scrapyard. Shut inside is Joe, an unstable, disillusioned security guard. What should have been another quiet night at work descends into a gruelling test as he must untangle a web of lies in a race against the clock to save a life."
