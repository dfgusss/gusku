    "overview": "Rory Scovel takes the stage at Minneapolis’ Goodale Theater to offer his observations on such disparate subjects as religion, sex, mushrooms, vaccines, parenting an eight-year-old, and much more in this standup special. The South Carolina native interweaves improvised moments with meta-commentary on the subtle art of stand-up as he riffs on some of the most awkward aspects of seemingly taboo yet universal topics – all with a dose of his amiable southern charm."
