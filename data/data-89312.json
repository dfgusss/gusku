    "overview": "Itsuki, who lives on welfare with her sick mother and baby sister, has given up on her dream of becoming a nurse and been hopeless for the future. One day, a transfer student named Kazuma, who has a secret about falling behind in his previous private middle school, joins Itsuki’s class. He also struggles under pressure from his elitist father. Sparked by this encounter, they break out of their circumstances and gradually find hope for the future on their own, involving many adults around them."
