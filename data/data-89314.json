    "overview": "The Vietnamese orchestra was founded in 1959 to join people through music, unstopped by war and borders, but it had been facing difficulty surviving. Then in 1992, to rebuild the orchestra, fueled by the belief that \"first-class countries have first-class orchestras,\" the orchestra leader invites Japanese conductor Sakura Kazuo to Vietnam to be their conductor. Together with interpreter Morioka Yuko, Kazuo works to overcome cultural barriers and aims to build a first-class orchestra while interacting with the unique Vietnamese members."
