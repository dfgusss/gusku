    "overview": "Abandoned by his lover, Ozan begins to suffer from love and cannot find solace anywhere he goes. Ozan decides to commit suicide one day. Suicide is legal as long as it is under state control, but there is only one exception to this: No one should fall in love with the person who will commit suicide or make such an application. When Ozan goes to the life termination center, his application is examined and he receives a rejection. Because a woman named Ekin is in love with Ozan, whom he never knew. That's why the poet can't die. His only solution is to find this girl named Ekin and make her give up on her love."
