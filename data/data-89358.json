    "overview": "2021. After spending a year in confinement, a group of high school students and their two teachers begin an end-of-year trip to Mallorca. This great plan is the last opportunity they have to all be together, make up for lost time, be able to have fun like they have never had before and say goodbye to this crazy stage of their lives. However, a new coronavirus outbreak disrupts all their plans and forces them to stay locked in their hotel rooms. More than 50 students, 2 teachers, a hotel and many, many minibars... What could go wrong?"
