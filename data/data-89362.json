    "overview": "When a skeptical young woman, who is not a fan of horror movies, gets lost in the forest, she seeks refuge in a shelter, worried that someone or something is stalking her. It doesn't take long for the elements within it to further concern her. Creaking sounds, thunder, a very strange caretaker, and incessant phone calls make her question the terrifying reality she now finds herself in."
