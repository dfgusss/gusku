    "overview": "A Dark Comedy by Guile Branco. As Angela, a former dancer, descends into madness, her family tries to cope the best they can. After an infamous dinner where a certain \"finger\" incident occurs, their lives collectively spiral to new levels of chaos, including, but not limited to, a sadomasochistic power dynamic, a cozy coffin and a bloody endeavor where a dinosaur may or not be present. All of the skeletons will come out at a Halloween night feast."
