    "overview": "Pilar is an ordinary woman who lives immersed in a routine that has never been questioned: work, family and housework. Therefore, when she is unexpectedly told that she is being fired, she enters into a deep identity crisis. Despite everything, she refuses to give up and clings to what she thinks she has left: her role as a mother of two teenagers, but, unfortunately, her children no longer need her as before. In this personal situation, she is moved by the generational clash regarding the young women in her family, who, like a mirror, reflects her longing for a life that she has never lived."
