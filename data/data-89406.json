    "overview": "The film is based on real events – in 2005 Viktor Kalivoda murdered 3 random strollers he chanced upon in the forests in Czechia. The case received much attention for its lack of motive. After his arrest, Kalivoda confessed, but did not reveal his motive. The film will closely observe one year in his life leading up to the murders and his arrest."
