    "overview": "The story of the relationship between Military Police commander Domingos Macedo and his children over three decades. Raised in a toxic family environment, the children struggle to survive the rigid rule of a man forged by the brutality of the Military Police. Flávia learns early on that defending herself is an act of rebellion and transforms fear into strength, until she manages, in her own way and by her own rules, to challenge her father's power on the Andaraí favela (community)."
