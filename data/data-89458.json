    "overview": "The girl Zhao Xiaoman repeated her life of doing odd jobs, and the intrusion of a stray dog gradually made her let go of the pain of her family. The inseparable day and night companionship warmed the two lonely souls. When bidding farewell is inevitable, should we still take care of it? Xiaoman chose to respond calmly with actions - I want to take care of myself, we will all be fine."
