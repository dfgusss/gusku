    "overview": "Tiny cornflake boxes with precise proportions, absurd everyday humor, and melancholic animals are some of the things that characterize the miniature maker Niki Lindroth von Bahr. The Guldbagge Award-winning Min börda led to success and recognition. Now she has won so many awards that they no longer fit on the shelves at home. In Joanna Karlberg and Tove Palén’s documentary, we get to enter the model studio and witness everyday situations that are transformed into great art in a small format."
