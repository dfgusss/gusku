    "overview": "At 22, Damien is a far-right soldier : an activist for \"Barrière Nationale\", a fringe group fighting against the so-called \"Great Replacement\", he lives only for his homeland. On June 24th, as Paris swelters under a troubling heatwave, Damien guns down eleven people in a mosque. Arrested that same evening, the media erupts and speculation spreads ; to some, Damien is a monster, to others, a neurotic consumed by loneliness. From his rural childhood to his philosophy studies in the capital, nothing seemed to point toward such a violent act. Who is responsible ? Damien’s story — or those who shaped him ?"
