    "overview": "Biopic of Javier Imbroda, coach and teacher, who transformed people and cities. The story of an overwhelming personality who made everyone win. Imbroda made it possible to take his school team to the national elite, the creation of Unicaja, the Lithuanian revenge or the genesis of 'the family', the best Spanish team in history. The documentary questions the conception of superficial and fleeting success compared to the human and profound triumph that Javier Imbroda represented in all its facets."
