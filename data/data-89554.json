    "overview": "Moving between biopic and documentary, the film attempts to shed light on the life and personality of the great theater actor Marilú Marini, following her for six years in rehearsals between Paris and Buenos Aires. Hard work, keeping on the move, creativity, and an insatiable desire for experimentation paint a portrait of the 80-year-old actor who continues to surprise and be surprised, to define and be defined by her own art. An engaging and deeply honest documentary that invites you on a journey of discovery of inspiration, through the beneficial effect of the passage of time."
