    "overview": "In the utmost secrecy, the first African space mission is preparing to take off! The crew, from Africa and its diaspora, is set to explore the planet \"NARDAL\", assessing its potential as a refuge for all Africans should Earth ever become uninhabitable. The problem is that the journey will be long. Very long. And in interstellar missions, the greatest unknown is whether the astronauts will be able to get along."
