    "overview": "Three houses, three boys, the same goal: to win the competition for a position as an employee in the legal office of the city. Federico, a law graduate, but only to please his father counsellor, hopes for his recommendation; Fabrizio, lawyer on paper but not practicing in life, tries to overcome the umpteenth public test and Luca, who since he was born has always had the road open. Only for one of them will the dream of a lifetime come true, until things take an unexpected turn."
