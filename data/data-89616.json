    "overview": "It's 1999. Sasha and his parents spend their summer holiday in a sanatorium, where he gets the titular role in an amateur musical production of Orpheus and Eurydice. He is paired with Polina, an employee of the sanatorium and a local beauty. Sasha falls in love with a girl and, without realizing it, drags himself and his family into an unequal battle with the manager of the sanatorium Misha, who does not hesitate to use any leverage so that Polina stays with him."
