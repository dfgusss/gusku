    "overview": "When a naive online “soda influencer” is radicalized against the Coca-Cola Corporation by an AI misinformation video, he travels to Atlanta on January 6th to expose the conspiracy. He is joined by his friend/documentarian and a new cameraman hired off of Craigslist to film the journey. But what started as a righteous political cause turns into a nightmare of deceit, libations, and, ultimately, a horrific act of violence."
