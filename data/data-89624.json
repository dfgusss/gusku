    "overview": "Hank gets ready. He has the money with him, he just has to fill out the form with Eddie. Then everything is ready for his appointment with Dr. Gale Gustberg, a very peculiar woman who plies her \"trade\" in a white truck and solves crossword puzzles in her very own way. A few final instructions and off we go for the thoroughly skeptical Hank. He gets two minutes."
