    "overview": "In a story told straight and with restraint we watch Naoko Hanami. She quit her job to look after her dementia-stricken mother Kiyo while the health of her father, Eiji, worsens with age. Struggling alone, she presents a stoic face to the world, too quiet and maybe too scared to speak up for herself. Finally, she turns to the city office to apply for welfare which is where caseworker Munemura, a genuine and sympathetic person, starts to investigate Naoko to see if she qualifies for help."
