The island's one-handed Fire Biotechnology accidentally lost two genetically mutated monsters in a transaction with its employer, causing a series of hurtful incidents. But what is unexpected is that while Song Nan, a young biologist, was investigating the incident, his biological daughter Xiaoting was abducted by a monster. What makes Song Nan even more unexpected is that these two mutated monsters are actually secretly related to his ex-wife Zhou Qian. An arduous task of searching, subduing the monster, and rescuing Xiaoting begins. In this race against time, Song Nan was unknowingly involved in a bigger conspiracy."
