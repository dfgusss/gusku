    "overview": "Now ninety-three years old, Claudia Andujar managed to survive the Holocaust as a child. The award-winning photographer has been travelling the Amazon since the 1960s. This has resulted in a profound contact with the Yanomami people. The Yanomami learnt from Andujar how to defend themselves against the overexploitation of the rainforest and their expulsion. Victims become activists."
