    "overview": "Rafael began his transition ten months ago. His long-awaited journey with testosterone is not an easy road; no one told him about the emotional process this change would entail. He feels so uncomfortable as his body changes that he finds himself unable to do something as simple as going to the beach. Together with his friend Carolina, who has accompanied him since the beginning of his transition, he will try to reconcile with himself and with Rafaella -his former name- to finally be able to swim in the sea."
