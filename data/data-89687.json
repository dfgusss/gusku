    "overview": "This is the story of Fahimeh Akbari, a leading lady in the musical and cultural history of Iran, an exceptional talent whose magical voice and unique style enriched both the folklore and urban musical landscapes of Iran, a pioneer who breathed new life into the music scene by introducing and marrying European tunes and rhythms with that of Gilan, Iran. Fahimeh Akbari, a figure so remarkable and revolutionary that her marked absence seems almost mythical. A familiar tale of a female artist mysteriously forgotten and seemingly erased from history books."
