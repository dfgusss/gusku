She writes down those thoughts on her social media account under the name of Lovesick Ellie. Akira Omi seems like a perfect guy, with good looks and gentle personality. One day, she witnesses Akira Omi spouting vulgar language and she realizes he is kind of like a two-faced person. Making things worse, her fantasy thoughts are discovered by him. He thinks that she is funny and he approaches her."
