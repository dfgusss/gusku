    "overview": "When nursing student Esha is found brutally murdered in her Azimpur sublet, newly transferred officer Lina takes on the case. As she investigates the dark layers of Esha’s life—abuse, harassment, and a secret relationship—Lina also confronts her own haunted past. With the clock ticking and pressure mounting, she must solve the case before an innocent man is framed. Esha Murder: Karmaphal is a gripping thriller and a chilling critique of systemic failure."
