    "overview": "Danya is a successful advertiser with delayed life syndrome. He tolerates the present for the sake of an ideal future, which he constantly dreams of: a solid income, a house in Italy and a pretty wife from social networks. He strives with all his might towards his goal, but life makes its own adjustments, or rather death. Postponing everything for later, Danya starts an old disease and suddenly falls into a coma. He finds himself in the waiting room of the afterlife, which suspiciously resembles the airport from his latest commercial. There are only two flights — to heaven or hell. However, the chance to return to the world of the living is not lost either. While whiling away the time at the local bar \"Darling, I won't call you back\", Danya rethinks her life and tries to fix everything."
