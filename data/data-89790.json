    "overview": "Viktoriya is a successful businesswoman; in her strictly planned life there is no place for chaos, especially for men. She is stubbornly pursuing the largest contract of her career with investors from the UAE. Almost before flying to a meeting in Dubai, Viktoriya learns that her Arab partners only work with family people. \"A man who has a family has honor,\" they say. Viktoriya does not intend to lose the contract, so she passes off her subordinate Roman as her fiancé. Viktoriya and Roman are flying to Dubai for a deal, their task is to under no circumstances break up and reveal the fictitiousness of the relationship and get a contract."
