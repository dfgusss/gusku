    "overview": "Left with no one following the death of their grandfather, Grasya and Armando were forced to live with the same poverty-stricken scenarios of everyday living. They woke up early to grow crops in hopes that they could harvest it and fill their empty stomachs and table. In extreme exhaustion, Armando starts to grow in curiosity of who their god is. With this question, Grasya recalls a memory that would reveal the nature of their false-god who would make them mentally deranged from bitter lives and rumbling stomachs."
