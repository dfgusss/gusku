    "overview": "After an accident, ten-year-old Ilya falls into a coma. His father Andrey is on duty at his son's bedside in the hospital, but the attending physician informs that the boy will have to be disconnected from the life support device — this is the law. Andrey offers money, tries to convince the doctor that it is necessary to wait, but everything is useless. Then Andrey brings a gurney with Ilya connected to the device to the first ward he comes across, barricades the door, and, threatening with a gun, takes a doctor and a nurse hostage. Andrey gave his son a man's word that he would save him, and he will keep his word."
