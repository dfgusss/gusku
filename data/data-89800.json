    "overview": "The war burst into the peaceful life of three friends suddenly, forever changing their destinies. Each of them went to the front, leaving the most valuable things at home in order to fight for this most valuable thing. Surprisingly, they are helped to survive in this fiery hell of battles with fascism, music. Taking musical instruments with them, friends play to maintain the morale of fellow soldiers, as well as to compose the leitmotif of Victory so desired by all."
