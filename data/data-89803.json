    "overview": "Sergey and Anya are on the verge of divorce. For several years of family life, they managed to get each other hard. Anya reasonably considers Sergei to be a jerk, unsuitable for family life. Sergey got fed up with his wife's constant irritability, he is sure that Anya had never behaved like that before and was funnier. The couple are going to go to the registry office to put an end to the relationship, but fate orders otherwise. Leaving the house, the couple miraculously return to the apartment every time. And this is not the only oddity. It's winter on the calendar, summer outside, and the eternal 8:45 on the clock. And in this new reality, they will have to get along somehow."
