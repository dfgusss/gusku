    "overview": "A violent and unruly man appears injured and without memory in a riverside community, who accuses him of robbery and tries, in vain, for him to recover his memory and return the money. In a popular trial, a plot involving domestic and gender-based violence, human trafficking and embezzlement of public funds comes to light. Sentenced to isolation, he seeks a new meaning for his life."
