    "overview": "Liza made a difficult decision at the moment of the birth of her illegitimate child in the hospital. So she had no choice but to abandon the child in the dustbin. As she was leaving the baby in a dumpster on the road behind the hospital in the dark of night, she came face to face with Dr. Tithi—the very doctor who had delivered Liza's baby in the operating theater. Tithi brought her back to the hospital and began to tell her a story. A story intertwined with Tithi herself, a 6-year-old girl named Pakhi, and a wild-hearted man named Johnny."
