    "overview": "France, 1963. Since she was a child, Natacha has dreamed of freedom and adventure. Her dream has a name: air hostess. She admires the women who fly the world, with no ties, no husbands, and no cooking to do. Despite all her efforts Natacha does not match the walking fantasy that an air hostess is supposed to embody at the time. She's too... or not enough... whatever it is, she hasn't got it!"
