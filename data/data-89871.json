    "overview": "A person in charge of “Belonging” appears before people whose lives have ended and tells them, “Do you have any regrets in this world? If you have, you can become an object and return there.” A wife decides to become her husband’s favorite mug, a boy becomes his favorite blue jungle gym, a grandmother becomes the camera that she gave to her grandson, and a mother becomes rosin that is used in a baseball game so that she can watch her son pitch in the game. At the very end of their lives, they spend time with their loved ones as objects."
