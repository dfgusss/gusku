    "overview": "\"The palm trees on the reverse are a delusion; so is the pink sand\". This line, taken from a poem by Margaret Atwood, lights the path traced in \"Postcard\". As the years go by, landscapes transform, take on new meanings, and hold onto joys that will never be regained. The sea and the beach, once stages of happy summers, romances, and encounters, will turn into concentration camps or centers of detention and torture. This occurs across different times and places. In this piece, I embark on a journey through some of my works that explore the relationship between testimony, spaces, and time, engaging in dialogue with the beautiful film directed by Alejandro Segovia in 1972."
