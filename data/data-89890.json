    "overview": "Channel Street Skatepark successfully existed for over a decade under the Interstate 110, despite its illegal creation, until overpass construction led to an ongoing shutdown. Channel Street founders and advocates continue to push for a reopening but the legal matter proves to be a much more complex task than anyone ever imagined. Concrete Law explores the battle between Channel Street Skatepark and bureaucratic control. This film uncovers the history of the park, from creation to current status, through interviews with park founders, local and pro skaters, business owners, and city officials."
