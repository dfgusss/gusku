    "overview": "Anna, a young and aspiring actress who has not had much success, offers to care for the father of Jorgen, who has been burdened with the responsibility. The father, Walentin, is in a mostly comatose state, which makes him the perfect audience for Anna, who begins acting out her scenes in front of him. Gradually, Walentin shows signs of recovery -- but is this due to Anna's kindness, or is it possible that the old man is a pretty good actor himself?"
