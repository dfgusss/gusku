    "overview": "The 1975 Metropolitan Championship was, for River, more than the conquest of a title; it marked the end of an agony that required the efforts of historical figures of the club. In the midst of a political and economic crisis, the film documents the tensions and challenges that had to be overcome in order to achieve the yearned-for lap of honor."
