    "overview": "Gerhard Schröder has always been a polarizing figure. Even on the occasion of the former Chancellor's 80th birthday, Germany continues to grapple with him. The Social Democrat remains steadfast in his friendship with Vladimir Putin, despite Russia's war against Ukraine. Schröder also refuses to relinquish his position at Nord Stream 2 AG. As a result, his entire political legacy is in question. In the documentary, reporter Lucas Stratmann confronts former Chancellor Schröder with the criticism and accompanies him from Hanover to China."
