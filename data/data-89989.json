    "overview": "Juan is 26 years old and has terminal cancer. He is confined in the hospital but he’s tired of feeling sick. So, one night, he decides to escape, with the help of his friend, Marta. Juan wishes to spend a normal night, like any other. He wants to drink with his friends, play table soccer, some darts, smoke a joint while the sun goes down but most importantly he wants to feel that everything else doesn’t exist… He wants to feel the time go by, no rush, just being with the ones he loves the most. That is his farewell. Really living one last night. But leaving just like that is not easy, and not everyone will agree with it. Because, sometimes, happiness also tears you apart."
