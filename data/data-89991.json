He impulsively steals one million euros from the company’s vault, tosses away the key to the safe and hastily flees with his fiancée Marine… Before discovering that his termination was a mistake, and he is actually being promoted! Stan has until sunrise to return the money to the vault. But having thrown away his key, and with the only spare inside the CEO’s own apartment, he must reluctantly enlist the help of Hippolyte, Paris’s most unpredictable locksmith. The night promises to be full of twists and turns!"
