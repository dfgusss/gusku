    "overview": "Can high school friendships last a lifetime ? One thing's for sure: before long, Aurore, Nours, Jeanne, Diane and the others will say goodbye to their boarding rooms, swimming in the Drôme and parties in the mountains. Louison will cut his dreads and the little family will break up. For some of them, it's not the first time, and it hurts even more."
