    "overview": "In the 1980s, a family of Algerian origin set off from Parisian Suburb Asnières-sur-Seine in France towards Marseille to take the ferry to Algeria. Lydia is spending her first summer without her big sister, who has just gotten married. The father promises his children that they will discover a wonderful country that he has always been homesick for. In the rickety vehicle they are travelling in, there is an atmosphere of joy and excitement, freedom and nostalgia. But the mood in the small, cramped van quickly turns negative as the father becomes more and more annoyed and patriarchal the closer they get to their destination."
