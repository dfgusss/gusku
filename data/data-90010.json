    "overview": "The country is under lockdown. Covid-19 has decimated the patients of the Retirement Homes. In one of them two stories flow parallel through the empty corridors. Alfredo, the medical director, must face the inspection of the inflexible inspector, Viola, to whom he must account for the anti Covid measures adopted. Meanwhile Georg, an elegant and light-hearted guest of foreign origins apparently heedless of any health precautions, uses all his talents to win the heart of a new patient, Alida, who, who resists advances with less and less firmness. The two plots will inevitably intertwine. But nothing is as it seems."
