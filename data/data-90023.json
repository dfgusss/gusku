    "overview": "When actor Jan Uuspõld has to film a promotional video for his summer fling Brita’s beauty salon, his wife calls him and lays down the law: he must come home and earn back all the money he has squandered. Since Jan always does what women want, he begins searching for a way out of the tricky situation. The solution seems to be participating in a remake of a film about his life. Unfortunately, the director decides to sideline Jan due to his poor public reputation. Left with no other choice, Jan embarks on a summer tour starring himself. But, as always, life happens when you have the best intentions. On his long journey home, Jan encounters a sex guru, men’s rights activists, manic fans, and even the Creator himself. He is both humbled and exalted, leading him to discover something within himself that he never knew was there."
