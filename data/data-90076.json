    "overview": "The documentary follows the trail of fruit and vegetables from the shopping cart back to various cultivation areas throughout Europe. The entire supply chain is revealed via a system that includes the inhumane exploitation of harvest workers and agricultural businesses. The aggressive pricing policy of the supermarket groups, their \"lowest price promise\", has established a modern form of slavery in Europe."
