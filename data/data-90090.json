    "overview": "When the world is hit with a naturally occuring virus that spreads among all living things, humans begin to turn into insatiable zombies. In the blink of an eye the world as we know it collapses. Furthermore, the few remaining survivors are unable to use the available food resources. They therefore develop a new crop to support themselves. Survivors depend on one profession, their only hope; someone in this profession must brave the dangers to send and recieve food and packages of necessities. These people are called Riders."
