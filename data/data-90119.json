    "overview": "The main characters start their dream jobs and their lives finally take the right direction. Or is it not quite the walk in the park they imagined? Eva is the only woman to get a job at the best advertising agency in the country, but she has no idea that she will be working under a sexist boss. Vítek, on the other hand, has finally decided to open his own hypnotherapy practice after many years, but he encounters misunderstanding from those around him, who have no idea what to expect from hypnotherapy. Everything changes when Eva receives an advertising assignment with a single goal: to make the client fall in love with her."
