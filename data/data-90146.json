    "overview": "Jati works out day and night to be like his idol, Joni Krakatau, a legend who stands atop the peak of success. When the more popular Abe stands in the way of his dream of becoming the best, Jati challenges him. As both men tear their muscle and dislocate their joints, they realize that success is not determined by who is the strongest, but who has the stronger determination to reach the top. With both men drenched in the pink goop of Joni Krakatau-branded protein shake, the whole gym goes into a frenzy in search of a true legend."
