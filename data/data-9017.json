    "overview": "A very free adaptation of Marlowe's \"Doctor Faustus\", Goethe's \"Faust\" and various other treatments of the old legend of the man who sold his soul to the devil. A nondescript man is lured by a strange map into a sinister puppet theatre, where he finds himself immersed in an indescribably weird version of the play, blending live actors, clay animation and giant puppets."
