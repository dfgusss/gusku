    "overview": "His buildings and sculptures still attract attention today, but their creator is almost forgotten: the sculptor and architect Bernhard Hoetger. The 90-minute film by Gabriele Rose tells the fate of this idiosyncratic artist. Hoetger is portrayed by the actor Moritz Führmann. Starring alongside him are Florian Lukas as Heinrich Vogeler, Katharina Stark as Paula Modersohn-Becker and Ulrich Gebauer as Ludwig Roselius."
