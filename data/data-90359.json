    "overview": "The meeting between two women who are only apparently different from each other. Anna is in conflict with herself and her family, facing her illness alone; Cristi, on the other hand, flees from a war that keeps her away from home. Everyone advises Anna to follow her partner on a business trip, and Cristi to stay safe in Italy. The meeting between the two, although brief, will be a dive into freedom."
