    "overview": "Four lifelong friends—Tae-jeong, Do-jin, Yeon-min, and Geum-bok—dreamed of an epic trip abroad, but life got in the way. Years later, older but not necessarily wiser, they finally embark on their long-overdue journey. Planned as a carefree getaway, however, the trip derails into a whirlwind of unexpected chaos, hilariously absurd detours, and buried emotions resurfacing. As they stumble through misadventures, their first ride together turns into a spectacular journey—one for the ages."
