Katie is cheeky, funny, and wants to be one of the boys. Her housing estate is small and is filled with young families who make up the maisonettes, flats, and houses. The transition to teenage life brings Katie and her friends to places they did not expect when they push the boundaries of their circle and try on a maturity they are not yet ready for. A bursting coming-of age story with a twist, revealing the greyness we create to make sense of the world, rooted in deep friendships they hope can stand the test of huge change."
