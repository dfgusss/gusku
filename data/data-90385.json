    "overview": "Alice, a recently widowed director, is alone on her grief after her daughter leaves home. Alice clings to the only structure she has, a fragile foundation at risk of collapsing: an essay film project, about first loves, dependent on funding. Suddenly we enter in another dimension, another place and without prior notice we are in the film conceived by the director."
