    "overview": "Anav Kaushik, one hit film old Bollywood star and stoner, has no opinion.  On Visarjan Day of 2020, Anav (Shaurya Tyagi), finds himself in an interview with his ex girlfriend Ila Chopra (Rashi Mal), a journalist who grills him about the politics in his nationalist and pro-Police State films and allegations of drug use in Bollywood.  During the course of the day, the poster boy of the right, must figure a way to keep the increasing media glare away from his marijuana habit, cope with the angst of being a stranger to his ex once again, reflect upon his new hookup with potential and figure out what he wants most... when his whole career is at stake.  All because of a few joints.  Now, he must take a stand. Can he afford an opinion though?  Inspired by fake news and true events"
