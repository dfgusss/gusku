    "overview": "An interfaith couple flee persecution in their village and begin a new life in the city, compelled to live on the open pavements like countless migrants. But their minds are captivated by a throne-like armchair in an exquisite showroom right beside their settlement on which they dream to sit together one day as king and queen."
