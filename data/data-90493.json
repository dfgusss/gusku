    "overview": "Queer bodies attract, fall in love, falter, perish. Are our bodies more vulnerable, and therefore our loves, too? A poetic video letter; an intimate experiment of image and sound, of heart, head and hormones; and a loving ode to those who have passed on before memories together could be made."
