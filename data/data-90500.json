    "overview": "Blending archival footage, haunting melodies, and digital reconstructions, Hyjnesha në Fron traces the echo of loss across Kosovo's turbulent history, from forgotten rural struggles to national aspirations erased by war. A musical, visual essay shaped by absence, which resurrects physical memory through 3D reconstruction, showing how history persists even when its material proof has vanished."
