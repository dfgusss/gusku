    "overview": "What remains of the Island of Ischia and the Villa? What remains of these landscapes in which Luchino Visconti, icon of the cinema, lived and dreamed so often? He declared, probably referring mischievously to the Italy of his time, that \"you should never stop building your house... \" What remains of his loved ones, of those who like him resisted fascism and its potential and threatening return? The film will explore this legendary place, through the emptiness of the villa and its abandoned, decrepit but still present walls, reminiscent of the effervescence of the ideas and projects developed in that place. By returning to the island of Ischia, by finding the house as it is today, by reviving it as it was during the time of Visconti, thanks to images of the present, archival documents, and by making links with the aestheticism of his films, we will discover the filmmaker in a singular way."
