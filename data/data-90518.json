However, the Bellingas don't have much time, because the kids have to rehearse for the park show, and dad Daniel is training for the Summer Games, where he could win the \"coolest dad of the year\" award. Meanwhile, they also have to look after the director's dog, which is no easy task. When two well-known criminals suddenly show up at the park, chaos erupts, and the Bellingas find themselves in a crazy chase."
