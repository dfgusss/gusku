    "overview": "In the early spring of 2021, a man and a woman flew to Hong Kong at the same time, and while waiting to enter the mainland, they stayed in the same hotel, separated by a wall. During the short intersection of their lives, the two confided in each other about the pressure they were burdened with and found a spiritual harbor in Hong Kong, where tenacious vitality was blooming. And before the answer is revealed, the choice stops abruptly."
