During the search, Yun Shu gradually discovers that Sun Wukong's disappearance is connected to the Demon Lord's plot to break the seal and regain control of the Three Realms, with Yan'er being just a pawn in the Demon Lord's scheme. Ultimately, with the influence and help of the goddess Xi He, Yun Shu transcends his limitations, prevents the opening of the sealed gate, and becomes a true hero."
