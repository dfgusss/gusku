They are called for a simple repair job in a place they find abandoned and unlocked, with the door wide open. Inside, they are surprised to find a dead body, unaware that the crime scene they have stumbled upon belongs to a known criminal. They make every possible mistake, turning themselves into the prime suspects of the murder case. From this point forward, they try to stay away from both the crime family and the police."
