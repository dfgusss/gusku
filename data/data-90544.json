    "overview": "Year 2015. Hanna (mother) and Darka (girlfriend) are united by the memories of Danya, who died in 2014 on the Maidan. Hanna's life path went from a Maidan activist in 2004 to a high-level government official. Through the relationship between the two women, it turns out that Hanna was associated with the corruption that led to mafia revenge in Ukraine in 2010, and ended up the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. Hanna is increasingly convinced that her personal actions are linked to her son's death."
