    "overview": "Givi lives in Moscow, and Levan in Tbilisi. The friends had not seen each other for thirty years and found each other on a social network. It would seem that they have nothing in common. Givi is a film director and has family problems. Levan is lonely and lives like a homeless person. Givi is going through changes in his life, while Levan has not changed anything for a long time. But they have something in common – childhood memories. Thanks to communication on a social network, they begin to help each other. Levan opens up to Givi from a new, unexpected side, and Givi gets the opportunity to return to his childhood, to his hometown."
