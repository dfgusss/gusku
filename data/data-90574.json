    "overview": "From \"Bound\" to the queer series \"Work in Progress\", an exploration and deciphering of the artistic work and revolutionary career of Lana and Lilly Wachowski. \"Matrix\" is the soil in which all the seeds of the filmmakers' struggle were sown. Feminism, anti-capitalism, trans-identity and racial justice are encoded in trench-coat action scenes and symbol-laden metaphors. The two sisters, as uncompromising in their societal battles as they are in their experimental aesthetics, are a happy Hollywood anomaly, a real crack in the matrix it's time to rediscover."
