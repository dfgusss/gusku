    "overview": "Cheng Jie, chairman of a certain group, was instructed by a \"master\" to have sex with a woman to change his luck. He targeted Han Mei, a \"single mother\" employee of his company, and raped and injured her, leaving her in a vegetative state. Afterwards, he lied to the media that it was Han Mei who seduced him and asked his pregnant wife to cooperate in the play, successfully changing public opinion. Han Mei's sister, policewoman Qiu Yi Zhao, firmly believed that Cheng Jie was lying and started an investigation. In the process of collecting evidence, she encountered many obstacles from evil forces, and Cheng Jie's ugly face of a beast in human form gradually surfaced."
