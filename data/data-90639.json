    "overview": "Six strangers find themselves trapped in a New York City subway by Mac, a mysterious man who claims to be a demon hunter. Insisting one of them is evil, he peeks into their souls discovering five eerie, supernatural tales: a desperate woman seeks help from a fortune teller, newlyweds discover a creature lurking outside their apartment, a young man visits an insane asylum, conjoined twins discover a wish-granting coin, and a man lusting over a co-worker discovers a magic potion shop. It's then up to Mac to solve the mystery and destroy the demon amongst them."
