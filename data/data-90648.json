    "overview": "On an island just after a typhoon, Lin Momo, a city girl with an injured eye, and Ah Xi, an aphasic girl born and raised on the island, meet suddenly. As the relentless storm gradually rips open their private and sad pasts, the two seemingly alternative but fiery youths comfort and support each other, using the power of friendship to fight against the typhoon of life. With the shocking secret revealed by Qing Kesao on her deathbed and the sudden intrusion of Chen Shunan, the next typhoon sweeping over Mo Mo and Ah Shi comes out of nowhere, and under the eye of the wind, they must decide whether to run away or face the wind. They must make a choice."
