    "overview": "The carefree lifestyle vacation of Désirée, her white lover Elias and her gay friend Sal turns into a journey of self-discovery in the desert. Désirée’s mother has cut her off and gets them thrown out of the vacation home with pool. In the barren landscape of Fuerteventura, the friends move around as if on an empty field in search of meaning. They desire each other, challenge each other, slip into new roles. A game with the overarching triangle of class, race and gender."
