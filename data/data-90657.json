    "overview": "In the conservative northwestern region of Argentina, Julieta finds herself accused of infanticide after a medical emergency. Facing a miscarriage of justice that lands her in prison for a crime she didn’t commit, her only hope is getting the chance to challenge her conviction in a courtroom battle with the help of Soledad, a fearless lawyer who risks everything to defend her. Their fight for justice will slowly begin to fuel a growing movement for solidarity and women’s rights."
