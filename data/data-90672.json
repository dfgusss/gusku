    "overview": "Surrounded by a lazy husband, a pedantic stepson, a sexist boss, a self-centered friend, and a neighbor who ruins her sleep with frequent parties, Bia must exert enormous energy to maintain control. But the arrival of a young influencer who takes a higher position than her at the magazine where she works is the final straw. On the verge of a breakdown, Bia ends up being treated by Deusa Xana in a kind of esoteric session. As a result, she frees herself from all filters and begins to practice zero tolerance for all the absurdities that affect her daily life."
