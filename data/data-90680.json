    "overview": "Feeling nostalgic about their high school days, Hervé, Maxime, and Jordy decide to host a grand reunion party to reconnect and celebrate their 30-year graduation anniversary. However, their idealised memories clash with reality: no one wants to come, especially their former classmates Anne and Marion, who are determined to sabotage the event. For the first time, the trio face a harsh realisation – could it be that all this time they’ve been nothing but a bunch of pretentious jerks? Determined to make amends, they embark on a hilarious quest to prove to the world and themselves that they can be better men."
