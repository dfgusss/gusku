    "overview": "Lola and Cuau, a progressive middle-class pair, and Iñigo and Majo, a young conservative, well-heeled duo, turn to artificial insemination as a last resort to have children. In a madcap twist based on actual events, a mix-up at the clinic results in each mom-to-be carrying the other one's baby."
