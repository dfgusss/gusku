    "overview": "Cha-Cha is the love story between the titular Cha-Cha, a free-spirited artist, and Raku, a boy with increasingly questionable tastes. Cha-Cha is painted with the whimsical colors of a romantic comedy at its surface that belie much, much, much darker hues to be found in its deranged depths. Cha-Cha is silly, sweet, screwball, and completely unexpected."
