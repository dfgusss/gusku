Her parents and older sister Marion live in constant fear of losing her. Disconnected from typical teenage dreams, Marion seeks escape in a relationship with an older boy. When a new diagnosis emerges, the family’s future is redefined, opening up unexpected possibilities. Bertille will live, and so will her family."
