The region harbors business opportunities as touristic interest booms; however, HAKKI fails to catch the trend. One day, he finds a historical artifact in his garden by chance and sells it for a car's price, later he finds out the actual value of the artifact is a hundred times higher. With great ambition, he starts digging tunnels in his garden, hoping to find more valuables, yet he gets nothing. He is now obsessed, sacrifices much of his life and takes on a dark journey for both him and his family."
