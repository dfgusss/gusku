    "overview": "Mariusz and Monika are neighbors whose acquaintance began with a turbulent conflict. Mariusz, a musician, was notorious for hosting loud parties and jam sessions until dawn. For Monika, who lived on the fourth floor, the sleepless nights became torture, and her aversion to her noisy neighbor grew with each party. Everything changes abruptly when they are united by the loss of a mutual friend and a shared dream: the construction of a rehabilitation clinic for children with disabilities."
