    "overview": "Eid, a young Bedouin from Rahat, spends his nights in Skype calls with Dounia, a married Arab actress living in Paris. Dounia is both his audience and his muse for a play he is writing about his life. When his parents force him to marry a woman he doesn’t know, Eid fears he will not be able to complete his dream. Eid will try to change his fate, determine the ending of his play himself, and tell his story—even if no one is there to listen."
