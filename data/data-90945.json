    "overview": "At 55, Gabrielle, a brilliant scientist who has just been laid off, decides to take her life back into her own hands: she wants to have a child! Her mother, Rose—eccentric and kind-hearted—enthusiastically gets involved in helping her find the “perfect sperm.” That’s when Gaby meets Pierre, 58, a charming man in crisis, and Max, 26, his son, who’s searching for a father rather than a pal. Between desire, taboos, and pretenses, each finds themselves confronted with their own contradictions. A tender, sharp, and deeply human comedy. Because, in the end, everything is always possible."
