    "overview": "We Are the Champions isn’t just a Queen track, it’s the sound of victory itself. This documentary traces how Freddie Mercury’s vision of a communal anthem leapt from News of the World into stadiums across the globe, becoming the ultimate soundtrack to triumph. With Brian May and Roger Taylor reflecting on its creation, and with decades of archive footage showing fans, athletes, and nations singing as one, the film makes a case for why this towering arena ballad still rules the winners’ podium."
