    "overview": "We are beyond excited to introduce “Gatecrashers”, an exhilarating short film celebrating the strong female Parkour community.  This film isn’t about gender inequalities or the sexualization of women in Parkour or the experience of being a woman in male-dominated sports. This film is all about highlighting high-class Parkour athletes pushing their boundaries and the boundaries of the sport. “Gatecrashers” follows 8 female Parkour athletes as they travel through three European cities over the course of three weeks, training, exploring and having a great time.  This film is for the girl in Parkour class looking for role models who send hard. It’s for the athletes needing motivation to explore their city. It’s for the practitioner looking for new ways to move, and for everyone who played with the idea of giving Parkour a try and hasn’t found the courage to do it yet. If you like to move, this film is for you."
