    "overview": "Doctor Cha is an acclaimed doctor, praised both for his professionalism and big heart. What no one knows, is that he is in fact a cold-blooded butcher who illegally harvests organs and deals them in the black market for a huge profit. But one by one, his loved ones start ending up either missing or dead; he has an inking feeling someone is out to get him- but who? After losing his daughter, a shaman seeks vengeance. He finds out that a corrupt doctor is responsible for what happened to his daughter… so he vows to pay him back, with what he does best; by bringing in the dead to the world of the living."
