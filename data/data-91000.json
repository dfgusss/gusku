    "overview": "Formed in Boston, Massachusetts, in the summer of 1981, SSD (Society System Decontrol) are universally recognized as the first straight-edge band and their 1982 debut The Kids Will Have Their Say is considered a landmark release for hardcore music. However many fans consider 1983’s sophomore effort Get It Away to be the band’s most crucial release. Trust Records has re released both albums and has partnered with Six Stair Productions to tell the story in this short film about one of hardcores most important bands, SSD."
