    "overview": "Through an intimate reconstruction of an important phone call, When The Phone Rang investigates dislocation and the nature of remembering. In the protagonist's eleven year old mind the phone call erases her entire country, history and identity and hides its existence in books, films and memories of those born before 1995."
