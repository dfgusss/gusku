    "overview": "Set against the backdrop of the Jeju Uprising in 1948, which was sparked by an armed revolt of islanders fearing the division of Korea into North and South, the film portrays the tragic consequences of an indiscriminate punitive expedition by the South Korean government. Under the guise of an anti-communist campaign, more than 25,000 civilians were slaughtered. Through the story of a mother fiercely protecting her young daughter, the film highlights the resilience and strength of Jeju women amidst the chaos."
