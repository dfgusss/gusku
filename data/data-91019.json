The language barrier is far from being an obstacle to their mutual attraction and the same evening, Mary leaves her cabin to find the young man in secret. Under the full moon, they will experience a night of love full of passion. But as the boat enters the waters of the Aegean Sea, their story suddenly ends. Mary will have to find alone an answer to the unsolved mystery of love, facing the imposing ruins of an ancient Greek temple."
