    "overview": "Mélanie, a lawyer suffering from an incurable disease, has decided it’s time to enjoy life! She whisks Benjamin, her childhood friend, off on a road trip to Spain to explore their sensuality in a brothel. Now here they are, onboard a rundown van driven by Lucas, a burly chauffeur freshly released from jail. Contrary to Mélanie, Benjamin does not seem in any hurry to arrive. Indeed, he does everything he can to prolong this improbable journey with his good friend."
