    "overview": "When nature is destroyed, climate targets are disregarded and human rights are violated, there is always a lot of money behind it. This is where urgewald comes in. Since 1992, the environmental and human rights organization has been revealing the sources of money behind destructive projects. Over 30 years ago, a handful of activists gathered around a table in a shared flat to form the basis of the organization. Since then, the small club in the Münsterland province has become a recognized, powerful organization."
