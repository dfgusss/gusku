    "overview": "Fırat and Filiz are a couple in their 30s. Because their marriage has entered a period of stagnation, they go to a quiet, small hotel near Assos for a holiday. At the hotel, they meet Özkan and Aysun, local villagers who are running the entire hotel and the seaside restaurant. As Fırat and Filiz observe the relationship dynamics between the local couple, they start to mimick them. One day, while on a hike up a deserted hill, supposedly searching for a historical ruin, Filiz mimics Aysun’s way of speaking and seduces Fırat. The balance of power shifts in relationships, and the story moves toward an unexpected result."
