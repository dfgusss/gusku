    "overview": "In February 2022, in Kharkiv, twin sisters Maryna and Vladyslava Alexiiva had to flee in the middle of the night under the bombs. In extremis, they take with them their bronze medals, won in Tokyo a year earlier in synchronized swimming. They took refuge in Italy for six months, then decided to return to Ukraine to reunite with their team. From then on, they were obsessed with a single goal: to win the gold medal in Paris in 2024."
