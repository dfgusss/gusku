    "overview": "This tribute paid homage to the beloved characters we got introduced to in the 60’s and 70’s in The Beatles’ legendary songs, such as Sgt. Pepper and Eleanor Rigby. The show is a whirlwind of color and energy, with each character representing a different era of The Beatles' history. These characters, along with many other cast members, dance, fly, and perform breathtaking acrobatics, alongside revisited classics from The Beatles' timeless discography."
