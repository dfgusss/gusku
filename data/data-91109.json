    "overview": "Beset by countless royal suitors, a princess declares that she will only marry the king who rules over all the others. Adapting with exquisite style a very dark fairy tale from the works of Canadian author L.M. Montgomery (Anne of Green Gables!), U.K. animator Anna-Ester Volozh adds a further layer of feminist subversion to a story that’s already a challenge to patriarchal conventions."
