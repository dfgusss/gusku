    "overview": "\"During Covid, I was contacted online by a woman who lived in Berlin - a French-Caribbean singer and performance artist. She said she was a fan of my work and we started corresponding. These text messages turned into nightly Zoom calls which turned into a desire to meet in person. But travel restrictions in Germany and the US limited our choice to a handful of countries, one of which was England. She had a friend in London with an apartment that was going to be empty at the same time that my ex-wife was taking our kids to Maine for two weeks. So we decided to meet there. She wanted us to make a film together so I suggested we make a film about our relationship.\" - Caveh Zahedi"
