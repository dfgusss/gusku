    "overview": "Over the course of a day, Fausto, invincible in his inertia, watches a paradoxical procession of visitors pass by: the mellifluous parish priest of the town; a mysterious man with his absurd ghost-themed business idea; the captain of the Carabinieri who proposes a shotgun wedding to his daughter, who has become pregnant by a stranger. Finally, late at night, a couple of thieves enter the house with Barbara's complicity. Fausto surprises them, impassive and bored as always, and reassures them: there is nothing left, neither gold nor paintings, everything has been sold. The three do nothing but chat until the sun rises, when the thieves leave and Barbara puts the coffee on the fire."
