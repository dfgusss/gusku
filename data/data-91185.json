    "overview": "Somewhere in the Detroit multiverse, Slim Shady has escaped his 2002 timeline and popped through a portal to terrorize 2024. A serial offender with no shortage of targets, Slim's really back with Terminator-type tenacity, bent on taking out the very man that sired him: Marshall Mathers. In \"The Face-Off\" Slim and Marshall spar with the gloves off in an 11 minute roast battle that bends space and time, and shatters civility. Only when the dust settles do we discover which one wins the war for the soul of Eminem."
