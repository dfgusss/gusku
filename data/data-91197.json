    "overview": "In the film we meet Vera’s parents; Vibeke and Geir, the artist and recent closest friend, Edson, and childhood best friend Selma through the memorial ceremony for Vera. A ceremony that is developing to resemble as a cultural festival, rather than a conciliatory gathering for people in grief."
