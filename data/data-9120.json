    "overview": "It’s summer in the hood. As every year, there are those who stay, those who leave, and... those who should have left. Some, like Joe Hustleton, work «under the table» in the rich neighborhoods and fall head over heels for a pretty girl. Some, like Tony Pepperoni, play businessman and spend the summer fleeing a local gang leader and a psychopathic girlfriend. Some, like Sammy and Harvey, pretend to have left. Tropics are far for the homies... and summer promises to be very hot!"
