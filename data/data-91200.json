    "overview": "Almost two decades after comedian Robin Ince’s original idea to mash up science with comedy, music and culture in a new variety show, Nine Lessons and Carols for Godless/Curious People and Robin and Brian's Christmas Compendium of Reason are still here brightening the dark days of winter with a joyous celebration of all things curious and creative. This feature length documentary charts the evolution of those pioneering and legendary science variety nights that have attracted legions of fans both on and off the stage and raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for charity.  With loads of exclusive interviews and never before seen behind the scenes footage we look at how one person's 'stupid idea' ended up changing the shape of science communication and entertainment forever, moving science from the classroom to arenas."
