    "overview": "Within Tokyo’s criminal underworld, there is a violent power struggle between former allies that serves as the central theme of the film. Detective Ryuji (Ryuji Yamakita), his life consumed by a personal grudge against the criminal empire, finds himself caught in the crossfire of a gang war that is threatening to engulf the city.  To regain control, Jet (Matt William Knowles), a gifted mercenary with a dark past, teams up with Gondo (Sonny Saito), a respected crime boss who is coming under more and more pressure from rival factions. A cunning and elusive femme fatale, Masako (Fusako Shiotani) plays both sides as she manipulates the chaos for her own gain.  As hostilities worsen, a shadowy informant by the name of Jose (William Guirola) provides crucial information that could tip the odds. However, when the true extent of the corruption in the city is revealed, Detective Ryuji is left to confront his own demons and choose between carrying out justice or exacting retribution."
