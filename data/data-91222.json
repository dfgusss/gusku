    "overview": "FORTITUDE is a new documentary about the people, perils and promises behind the emerging space industry.  A new Space Renaissance is emerging: Sparked by humanity’s unquenchable thirst for exploration, fuelled by capitalism’s insatiable hunger for profits and propelled by breath-taking technological advances. Fortitude uncovers how a few influential individuals with utopian ideas and vast fortunes are forging a trillion-dollar off-world industry while inspiring millions of us back on Earth. This is the story of those who take risks, invest the capital, and endeavour to turn science fiction into science fact."
