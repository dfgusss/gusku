After Ne Zha kills himself and his mortal body dies, Tai Yi wants to build a temple to help him be rebirthed. Taoist Ran Deng presents Li Jing with the exquisite pagoda, saying that if Ne Zha accepts the incense without merit, he will be attacked by the devil's heart. Li Jing cannot bear to let Ne Zha go astray and decides to destroy the temple to make Ne Zha misunderstand, while Li's mother and Tai Yi secretly enshrine Ne Zha's tablet."
