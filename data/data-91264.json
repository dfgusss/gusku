    "overview": "Stas is a miner, not the most hardworking, but very charming. By chance, he ends up buried in a mine along with eco-activist Lena. Then he begins to hear a voice. Voice of the Earth. In her speeches, she speaks for the environment, and threatens that she will drown everyone if they don't listen to her. The problem is that only Stas hears her. And now he will have to very quickly convince the whole world that a) he is not a schizophrenic and b) he urgently needs to stop polluting the Earth, otherwise it will wash everyone away from its face."
