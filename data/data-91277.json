But Lola’s seemingly perfect life is interrupted when a ghost from the past Tori (LeToya Luckett) suddenly shows up at her doorstep in search of her husband Leo, after having gone missing for 5 years and being declared dead. Tensions rise and lives are turned upside down as Tori’s unexpected return leaves everyone questioning her motives and why she hasn’t gone to the police. Determined to start a new life, Tori demands that the Winters pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars, but before leaving town a bombshell revelation exposes even more dark and shocking secrets."
