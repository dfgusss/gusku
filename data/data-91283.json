    "overview": "Radio correspondent Karel Beran returns briefly to Prague from the Middle East due to an anonymous tip, but a revolution suddenly breaks out in Kambur just then. To fulfill his duty, he fabricates live reports from his Vinohrady apartment, simulating the uprising’s sounds with kitchen appliances. When Czech Radio decides to send a support team, he faces an impossible choice: admit the deception or stage his own death."
