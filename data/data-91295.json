    "overview": "Join multi-platinum-selling American singer and Queen frontman, Adam Lambert as he sets the record straight in this eye-opening music documentary. Having faced censorship in the U.S., Lambert brings his unique perspective to explore how British LGBTQ+ artists have fought for their place in the music industry. Through candid interviews with Queen's Brian May and Roger Taylor, reflecting on queer icon Freddie Mercury, to intimate conversations with Andy Bell of 80’s pop duo Erasure, and Skin from 90’s band Skunk Anansie (the first Black British artist to headline Glastonbury) and British pop icon MNEK, Lambert uncovers the groundbreaking stories of these artists. Each one not only defined their decade but also battled for queer rights, pushing against a music industry that often demanded conformity for success."
