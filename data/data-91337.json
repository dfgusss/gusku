    "overview": "Having missed out on his cult's long awaited ritual suicide, an obnoxious loser teams up with his bogus ex-messiah to rebuild their doomsday commune. Traveling together through middle America, the constantly-bickering duo induct a military wannabe, a mentally unstable mom, and a mysterious foreign hitchhiker into their cult... but will this family of outcasts fulfill their transcendent destiny, or decide this life might be worth living after all?"
