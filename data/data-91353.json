    "overview": "Three guys from a small town, looking for easy money, decide to rob a local bank. Armed with an excavator, they break into the vault and take everything from there. The morning after the raid, the robbers find out that 25 million rubles have been stolen from the bank. This is where the question \"Where is our money?\" hangs in the air, because in fact the trio took only a million from the bank, which means that either there is a \"rat\" among their friends, or there are another 24 million in circulation somewhere in the town."
