    "overview": "During President Nasser's reign, Cairo was a place of quirky chaos, suspicion and mistrust, full of sharp jokes and overpriced dreams. The post office only delivers recruitment and scholarship letters. Surprisingly, Elizabeth from the capital of classical music sends a letter to Ahmed, a stubborn pianist. His family loves football. Nobody wants a pianist or a writer in the family."
