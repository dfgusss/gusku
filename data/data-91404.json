    "overview": "Right from the early days of DOCTOR WHO exhibitions began to appear, the first being in 1965 when Daleks and props from DOCTOR WHO AND THE DALEKS appeared at major department stores across the UK.  Since then, countless exhibitions, official and unofficial, temporary and permanent, big and small, have come and gone... all part of the amazing life that DOCTOR WHO has away from the television screen.  These truly were, and in some cases still are, the GREATEST SHOWS IN THE GALAXY!"
