    "overview": "What kind of people live in a town that revolves around Halloween? In Oregon, the picturesque town of St. Helens was home to the filming of the Disney Channel’s youthful horror-lite film HALLOWEENTOWN in the 1990s. After it became a surprise hit—and now a cult classic—the town decided to capitalize on this starring role and invites tourists to celebrate the film and Halloween with them every year."
