    "overview": "Aisha, a 26-year-old Sudanese woman, lives in Ain-Shams, a neighborhood in Cairo with a large African migrant community. The authorities’ indifference to the violent tensions between Egyptians and various African nationalities, has allowed different gangs to seize control of the neighborhood. The situation quickly turns sour after one of them offers Aisha security in exchange for a favor."
