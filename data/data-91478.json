    "overview": "An older brother who can't fit into society, a father who has given up on his future, and a younger sister who is tied to the house. This is the story of the small steps these three people take.  The Great East Japan Earthquake suddenly changed the peaceful daily life of the people of Fukushima. Many people lost their homes and jobs due to not only the earthquake and tsunami, but also the nuclear accident, and left Fukushima. This is the story of a family living in the aftermath three years later, in Fukushima, where deep scars remain."
