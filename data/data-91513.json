    "overview": "Meet former gravedigger and doorman Ike Reilly. At 40 years old he landed a major label recording contract and in true rock and roll fashion he bought his family a dream home. He took his band out on the road where they became what The New York Times called \"one of the best live bands in America.\" Despite 9 albums, a cult following and immense critical acclaim Reilly has failed to achieve commercial success. Academy Award winning director James Marsh says, \"Ike's stuff sounds like it should be enormously successful and it just isn't and I have no idea why.\" Exploring Ike's career, the film culls over 40 years of footage masterfully weaving in songs that reveal a complicated and formidable artist with an incredibly charismatic family. Struggling with booze and in the face of foreclosure, Ike finds redemption in music, art and family as his 3 sons begin performing with his band."
