However, when Philipp is diagnosed with cancer, they decide to radically change their lives and really let it rip from now on. Together with their sister, they set up the YouTube channel “The Real Life Guys” and embark on spectacular adventures. Among other things, they build a rocket bathtub, a submarine they weld together themselves and a manned drone. The “Real Life Guys” infect a rapidly growing community with their zest for life. But when Elli has an accident and Philipp is diagnosed with cancer again, the twins learn with overwhelming intensity what really matters and how to embrace life in all its facets."
