    "overview": "Liu Hui is a widower whose son lives in America. She insists on living alone in the house she shared with her late husband, a calligrapher, and is surrounded by fond memories. As she gradually joins community activities, she strikes up an acquaintance with the kind and shy building caretaker who faces a quandary over a stray cat. Small moments together reveal loneliness and companionship."
