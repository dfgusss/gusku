His brother, Sohei, lives with him and also takes on the debt repayment and caregiving, dedicating himself daily to becoming a mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter, following in their father's footsteps. Despite their suffocating life, Ayato longs to seize a small piece of happiness with his girlfriend. However, on a night meant to celebrate his best friend's wedding with a modest yet happy gathering, their simple daily life is shattered by unexpected violence."
