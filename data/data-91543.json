    "overview": "Set of stories of couples who sign either their love or death sentence. Intimate, specific and diverse situations that give a panorama of the vast terrain of love relationships. Life is not the opposite of death, but rather its intermediate point. The opposite of death is love, because that is where the human being is more alive than ever."
