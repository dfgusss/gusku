    "overview": "35-year-old teacher Vilma Veierød lives alone. She shuns social media and worries too much - most of all about death. One day in December, the handsome priest Ivar and the pathologist Robert with Tourette's suddenly appear on her doorstep with a letter and the news that her father has died. Vilma didn't even know she had a father, and the letter turns her whole life upside down. Vilma's life has not been full of people. Not by a long shot. But now she suddenly must deal with two men. Three - if you count her dead father."
