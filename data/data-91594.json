    "overview": "When her father and uncles die, Jone (Josemi's daughter) decides to make a documentary about the Ibarretxe Brothers. Pioneers in the Basque audiovisual sector, creative, cheeky and always up to something, they were devoted to cinema made in Euskadi long before it was a reality. Analysing their films and talking to people who accompanied them (Stephen Fry, Echanove, Ramon Barea, Santiago Segura, José Luis Rebordinos), Jone gradually comes to realise that their cinema is nothing more than a faithful reflection of their own selves."
