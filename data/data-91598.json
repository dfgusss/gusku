    "overview": "An entertaining TV movie that tells us how the transition from the Estado Novo to democracy took place on April 25. All this through the eyes of a child, the daughter of a dutiful employee who always had to submit, even if he disagreed, to his boss's despotism in order to provide for his family. Until the day when she simply wanted to enjoy the day of absolute promise, so long awaited, with her daughter."
