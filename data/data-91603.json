    "overview": "Is it better to rely on your instincts or an app that guides you toward the perfect choice? Is it better to ask someone out in person or send a heart emoji on a dating app? This is the dilemma of Riccardo, the classic shy and awkward teenager, who relies on an unsettling digital avatar to find his soulmate; it is also Teresa’s dilemma, his sister, who seeks to explore the limits of love and respect in her relationship."
