Haunted by wartime traumas, Giovanni’s tumultuous spirit finds solace in the wisdom of an elderly lady who unveils his extraordinary gift: the ability to harness the spirit of a departed soul and heal the tormented. But as Giovanni’s reputation as a healer grows, he finds himself on a collision course with two formidable adversaries: the church and the mafia. Torn between his mystical calling and societal pressures, he’s pushed into a corner of isolation, forcing him to forsake his magical calling and embrace the expected life of a family man and farmer. But will that sacred soul, worshipped like a god, truly be lost to oblivion?"
