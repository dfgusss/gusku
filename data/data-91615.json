    "overview": "Élisabeth, a young painter who, after becoming quadriplegic due to an accident, tries to rebuild her life and identity through art. As her career begins to take off, an unexpected pregnancy with her best friend, Alexandre, forces her to confront her physical and emotional fragility, as well as the conflict between her desire for creative freedom and the new responsibilities life has placed upon her. Through painting, Élisabeth seeks to reconcile her traumatic past with an uncertain future, in an introspective story about resilience, the body, and personal transformation."
