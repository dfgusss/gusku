    "overview": "ROLE MODELS is a feature documentary about everyday photo habitués who traverse the streets of New York and Paris in pursuit of models to snap pictures of outside fashion shows. They are frequenters of an outside, birdwatchers of female beauty, gleaners - picking up images at the margins, at the gates of patronized culture."
