    "overview": "Using never-seen-before interrogation footage, this investigation of Benjamin Netanyahu and his inner circle provides an unflinching gaze into the private world behind the headlines. Petty vanity and a sense of entitlement lead to corruption and the Netanyahus' unwillingness to give up power. The extreme right senses opportunity in Bibi's weakness, and the dominos fall."
