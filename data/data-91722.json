    "overview": "Liza, a berserk 19-year-old TikToker is plucked off the internet, thrust onstage, and declared \"Lesbian Jesus!\". She travels the country by bus with her underqualified Momager and loving girlfriend Avery. In a rollercoaster of an interview with the New York Times, we learn that Liza has been assaulted by the producer who discovered her. While she wants to out him, he contractually owns her (and her music). And if the article is published, Liza and her mom will lose everything and get sued for defamation. They navigate this reality in real time (the 7 minutes before their bus leaves for Hartford)."
