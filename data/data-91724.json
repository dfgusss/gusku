    "overview": "Two former rivals reconnect over drinks and a quick bite. One is compulsively running through men and can’t kick the habit of drinking their blood, and the other is working through her trauma and settling down with a new career in monster counseling. Things get a little uncomfortable when the conversation turns to the same toxic lover that connected them — Count Dracula — one of whom is still entangled with him."
