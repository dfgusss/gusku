    "overview": "After 20 years, millionaire landowner Mike Buchanan is confirmed as the rightful Highland Chief. The Buchanans live in a magnificent house and estate on the edge of the Trossachs. His ambitious wife Paula is planning the inaugural three-day bonanza of tartan, and ceremonial regalia on the estate. She was the driving force behind Mike’s claim and is now the chief architect of his ‘coronation’ (well, much of it, when an ancient source can’t be found). Ceremony and ritual are unashamedly being invented. This is the story of how history is made... or in this case, how history is made up. As the family adopts increasingly bizarre and ancient entitlements, the inner workings of the British elite is revealed; raising important questions around class, national identity, history values and traditions, and the place of ‘Clans’ in the modern world."
