    "overview": "In this debut film, shaped as an absurdist mockumentary, Yara’s obsession with the famous stage and movie actor Maarten Heijmans takes serious forms. She is disappointed in her life as a grown-up and hopes to be seen and recognised by someone who is more successful, attractive and charismatic than she is. If he reciprocated her love, this would solve all her problems, she believes. But how will he react to her ultimate attempt to get in touch with him? And what does Heijmans think of the filmmakers who follow her in the process?"
