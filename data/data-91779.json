    "overview": "Jonathan McHugh’s documentary A Life in Rhythm: The Ray Conniff Story chronicles the life and legacy of Ray Conniff. From his beginnings as a trombonist/arranger during the heyday of swing working with Bunny Berigan, Bob Crosby and Artie Shaw to his acclaim as the leader of his own orchestra and chorus, Grammy winner Ray Conniff is among the few musicians to have had a successful career that spanned 65 years. He recorded over 100 studio albums, selling over 70 million copies, and created the “Ray Conniff Sound” by being the first to use voices to double as instruments on his recordings. Through personal interviews and vibrant performances, this is a heartfelt tribute to an international musical legend whose melodies continue to inspire."
