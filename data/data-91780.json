    "overview": "In the 1960s, Jule Campbell shattered glass ceilings, transforming a struggling sports magazine into a media empire: the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. The documentary chronicles Jule's 32-year reign, where she championed intelligence and empowered supermodels like Tyra Banks, Christie Brinkley, and Elle Macpherson. Weaving together her journey with feminism's evolution, the film explores the changing gaze on beauty, from objectification to body positivity. Through stunning visuals and intimate interviews with a wise, nonagenarian Campbell, we witness a legacy that continues to inspire."
