In 2003, a newly married couple who are always in agreement about everything hosts two sets of in-laws for Christmas Eve for the first time and find that they may not have had as much in common as they thought they did. And in 2024, a couple tries to arrange special Christmas surprises for each other but keeping them a secret may be harder than they thought."
