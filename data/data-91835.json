    "overview": "Every year, Sinterklaas's Club works tirelessly to make all the wishes from the mountains of wish lists come true. But some, unfortunately, are impossible to fulfill. When a storm at sea forces the steamboat to take a different route to the Netherlands, Sinterklaas suddenly sees an opportunity to make a wish from the pile of unfulfillable wishes come true. Sara has been asking for a real hug from Sinterklaas for years, but she lives far away… all the way in Austria. And now, that's right on the new route! The boat sets course for the White Mountains in Austria. There, Test, Coole, Dans, and the other Pieten see snow for the first time in their lives and all have snowy adventures. The whole village is in a festive mood, and Sara is overjoyed. But then Ozosnel suddenly disappears, and Sinterklaas can't go any further without his horse. Is there still a Christmas Eve in the Netherlands when Sinterklaas's Club is stuck in the snow?"
