Marco Marsepein is also determined to win, as he succeeds every year. His dearest grandmother's secret recipe has never let him down. But... this year, Bartus Bakker and his father are also vying for that coveted first place. The evil baking duo cunningly steals Marco's secret recipe and ruins his gingerbread dough.
