    "overview": "Laban is not like other ghosts, he is afraid of the dark. Laban wants nothing more than to be scary, but no matter how hard he tries, he only manages to scare himself. In the basement of the castle Gomorronsol, Laban lives with his mother and father Spöke and his daring little sister Labolina, who can imitate all the sounds in the world. The castle also houses people: the king and queen, as well as Princess Busan and little prince Bus, who are Laban's very best friends."
