    "overview": "In the hands of Mityai, a school geography teacher from Sochi, there turns out to be not just a talking parrot, but an intelligent parrot from an ancient family. His name is Innocent — or just Kesha for his own. The parrot turns out to be with Mitya at a difficult moment in his life — his girlfriend Lera puts the relationship on pause. She wants a luxurious life, but Mityai cannot provide it for her. But a parrot can. More precisely, he can \"pump\" Mitya so that he starts earning a lot. New friends conclude a contract — Kesha will help Mitya return Lera, and Mityai will help the parrot find and return his beloved parrot, from whom they were separated a long time ago."
