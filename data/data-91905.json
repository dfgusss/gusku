    "overview": "An ageing artist in the twilight of his career, Fermín's hand has started to shake. On the brink of financial ruin, he will have to move into the studio he shares with his friend Javier de Juan in an old garage, to which his son Pablo, also a painter, arrives on his return from a long trip to India, intending to stay with him. Their widely differing approaches to art and life will soon spark arguments between the two. Pepa, Pablo's mother and Fermín's ex, makes a suggestion: that they enter a competition to create their own version of El Bosco's The Garden of Earthly Delights, which could solve their financial problems."
