    "overview": "In the West Bank, children grow up amidst a harsh and unforgiving reality. Daily life for Palestinians in Jenin Refugee Camp is shaped by the Israeli occupation, and the violence and oppression that comes with it. On the hills near Nablus, a Jewish settler family navigate the personal sacrifices and grief that come with their decision to live in an illegal settlement. They are resolute in their belief to remove Palestinians and settle the land. Children and their parents from both these areas search for their place in a world defined by violence and polarization."
