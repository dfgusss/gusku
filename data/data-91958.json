    "overview": "Russian Germans are one of the largest migrant groups with voting rights in Germany, but people outside the community often don't know much about them. Except prejudices: Russian Germans would vote for the AfD and support Putin's war of aggression. But what really moves the community, how do people see themselves and other Russian Germans, what does family mean, what does religion mean - and what is really the level of sympathy for the AfD that the community is said to have?"
