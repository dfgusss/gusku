    "overview": "Gilbert and Sullivan are two inhabitants of a small archipelago in the middle of the ocean. Its residents live in floating houses with a small dock each. Sullivan is a musician and plays the ﬁscorn. Gilbert is the postman of the archipelago. One morning, during his delivery, Gilbert feels a special attraction towards one of the packages he must deliver. This is a package for his neighbour Sullivan. Inexplicably, that morning, Gilbert shirks his duty and decides not to deliver the box to its recipient. That decision will change the course of their friendship for ever."
