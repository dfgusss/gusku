    "overview": "The Crusades reign supreme. Joachim's habit has become like a second skin. Shrouded in the darkness of the world, his life intertwines with dreamlike experiences and mystical visions. A river of oil unfolds before his eyes. The ascetic receives a divine revelation—prophecies and visions that only his heart can unveil. His final endeavor is humanity's greatest challenge: overcoming the apocalypse.  A journey through hope, life beyond life, the values of existence—the search for the divine within every living being—the power of love."
