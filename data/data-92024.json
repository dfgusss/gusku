    "overview": "Since the start of Operation Iron Sword, provoked by Hamas’ attack on Israel, conditions in Gaza have become apocalyptic. After months of offensive, most of the territory is an uninhabitable field of ruins. 1.5 million people are displaced, forced to constantly relocate by the advancing Israeli army. Barely a third of the hospitals are functioning. According to Unicef estimates, a child is injured or killed every 10 minutes in Gaza."
