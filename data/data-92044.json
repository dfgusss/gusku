He decides to spend money on alcohol and food while spending the entire night recording Instagram Live videos for his \"fans,\" showing them the room and talking about what he will be doing in the movie. The night slowly unravels as various people call him, some to congratulate him, others to reprimand him for his negligent behavior."
