    "overview": "They say anything is possible in Las Vegas. Hank and Jack live this credo to the full and not just in poker. When Hank decides to run three back-to-back marathons in 24 hours, their friendship is suddenly challenged by a million dollar bet, pushing their limits both physically and emotionally. Inspired by true events, director Thomas Woschitz infuses his wonderfully bold take on the indie genre with a multi-faceted narrative that is universally relevant. When the stakes are high, you better know the odds."
