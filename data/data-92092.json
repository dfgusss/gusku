    "overview": "While the Calabrian mafia is spreading its influence in the early 70s, Antonio, son of the high-ranking 'Ndrangheta boss Giacomo Zagari, finds himself killing more and more frequently, ultimately realising that he isn't suited to this extreme lifestyle. While his generation rises up in factories, universities and public squares, Antonio finds the strength to defy his father, rejecting his legacy."
