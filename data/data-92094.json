    "overview": "From his harsh childhood in the burnt-out Lower East Side, musician Harley Flanagan burst onto the punk music scene at age 11 as drummer for his aunt’s band, the Stimulators. The founder of the Cro-Mags tells his incredible story, while interviews with hard rockers and icons like Flea, Ice-T, Henry Rollins, and Anthony Bourdain add insights. Featuring gritty footage of NYC’s downtown 1970s and ?80s music scene, this passionate film showcases Harley’s against-the-odds transformation from chaos to peace, driven by music, family, and personal growth."
