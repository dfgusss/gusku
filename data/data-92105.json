    "overview": "A woman realizes she’s pregnant and worries that the growing rift with her husband will mean she’s raising the child alone. Desperate, she enlists the aid of a local 'witch' to rekindle her husband’s passion for her. Things are great at first, but she soon notices him acting out of character and becoming violent when she questions him. Is the spell he’s under tainted? Or is something even more sinister going on?"
