    "overview": "A goofy-sincere romcom with an indie edge, GÜLE-GÜLE follows two beautiful people, seemingly strangers, who can’t escape their incredibly annoying partners during a Korean group tour of historic Turkey. Jeong-wha is all but babysitting her perpetually drunk (ex?) husband, and Dae-sik has to humor his supervisor’s juvenile power games. Travel is supposed to be a respite from everyday life, but these two find themselves stuck with the parts of home they most want to escape."
