But instead of becoming a hero, he’s spent 38 years single—until he finally finds a girlfriend. His happiness is short-lived, however, as she abruptly breaks up with him via a cryptic message saying, “Your smile seems fake.” During his search for her, he meets Hsin-chieh, a fearless and passionate woman. As he tries to use his ability to help her, he only ends up creating more chaos in her life."
