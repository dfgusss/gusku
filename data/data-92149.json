    "overview": "A SHOT IN THE FOOT depects hectic nocturnal routines of a young woman who works as an assassin. She is a quick and innovative killer, efficient at her job. But she grows careless as she parties hard and gives in to the thrill of money, exposing herself to the dangers of LA’s underground. She gets sloppy, but the jobs keep coming, and there is no one except herself to clean up the mess she leaves behind."
