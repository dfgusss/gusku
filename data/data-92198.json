    "overview": "1936, in the aftermath of the Ethiopian occupation by Fascist Italy, under the incredulous gaze of the inhabitants of the small town in the Italian province Abraham Imirrù, an ethiopian prince and guerrila fighter is being held prisoner in the local Podesta garden's aviary. But for little Emilio, local recently force enlisted and reality-dissociated Balilla, he is Sandokan, the literal Salgari's character ...and he will be his hero."
