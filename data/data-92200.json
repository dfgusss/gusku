    "overview": "A forest is not only the realm of trees, but also a world of animals. When it gets dark in the forest, we humans leave this place, we are not made for darkness. This is different with nocturnal forest inhabitants: they communicate with sounds, orient themselves with ultrasound and their often looking eyes are perfect to find their way in the jungle of trees."
