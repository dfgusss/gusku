    "overview": "Scriptwriter Yokota Yuji, who is troubled by the fact that his next work is not going as well as he had hoped, receives an email offering \"regression sleep\", which claims to allow him to face his past self. Yokota attempts regression sleep, hoping to lead himself to becoming a successful scriptwriter by advising and encouraging his 30-year-old self.  Although the young Yokota is perplexed by the fact that the 30-year-old version of himself that appears before him is far from his ideal image, he accepts the advice of his future self and follows a new world line that branches out from a promise he made with his theater friends and an encounter with Asami, a fan of Yokota's."
