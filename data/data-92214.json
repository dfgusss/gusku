    "overview": "The encounter between physics and cinema and the terribly topical subject of the end of the world turned the set of Liliana Cavani's The order of time into a kind of Noah's Ark, where cast and crew isolated themselves for five weeks.  Flooded by the climate emergency, wars, and the dystopian future, while Cavani holds the helm of the ship and Carlo Rovelli explains the end of time, the film's meteorite becomes in the documentary a metaphor for what happens in the protagonists' real lives."
