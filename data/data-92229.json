    "overview": "The allegations against Sean “Diddy” Combs have shocked millions of fans and the entire music industry. Claims of so-called “Freak-offs,” where his girlfriend and others were allegedly drugged and forced into group sex with male prostitutes, are just part of what appears to be a sex crime empire on the same scale as the Jeffrey Epstein case.
