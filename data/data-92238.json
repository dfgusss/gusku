    "overview": "This film featuring Tilda Swinton was shot early 2024, in a abandoned camp of the Kew Thab Yang Forest Preserve in Chiang Rai. The artist made two versions filmed by different cameras, resulting in two expressions. This version, filmed with a pocket camera, reflects a personal interest in low-resolution imagery as well as memory blending experiments."
