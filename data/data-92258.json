Just as he is about to jump, a person is hit by a train at the previous station, which makes him reconsider. In tribute to Tomohiro, the man who died instead of him, Ippei sneaks into his funeral. Upon returning home, he is confronted by his ghost. Grateful that Ippei continues to live because of his death, Tomohiro makes an astonishing request."
