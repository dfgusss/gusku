    "overview": "Wheelchair basketball is often associated with disability sports. However, wheelchair basketball is a sport for both people with and without disabilities. Inspired by the dedication to wheelchair basketball of national team coach Lee Won-woo, known as the ‘fox of the court’ in the 1990s, and his protégé, coach Han Sa-hyun, this human-action sports story follows a middle-aged basketball star past his prime, an arrogant basketball genius, and men with rounded steel legs due to accidents. Together, they unite through wheelchair basketball to pursue their dreams."
