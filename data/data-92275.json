Their neighbors have the opposite \"problem.\" Tomáš and Laura are full of life, beautiful, passionate, and loud. Their boisterous antics upstairs cannot be ignored. It gets on Evžen's nerves, but it awakens a long-suppressed interest in Anna. An invitation to visit gradually takes an unexpected turn and reveals one secret after another. Will divorce or new erotic experiences come first?"
