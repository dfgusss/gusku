    "overview": "In 1870s Arizona Territory, a desperately needed wagon full of medical supplies falls victim to an Apache attack. The only man who can guide it through is Merrick Beckford, but in order to get there, he’ll need to enlist the help of a trio of dangerous outlaws hellbent on survival. When they accidentally kill an Apache scout, all bets are off, and survival is the name of the game."
