    "overview": "A lonely stray dog named KALB summons a djinn, DJINNI, who is frustrated by her job pulling her away from her ibrik paradise. While Kalb enjoys the companionship, Djinni is conflicted, as the fun she has playing with Kalb is dampened by her failure to understand what Kalb wants. After an explosive episode, Djinni realizes Kalb's desire for an owner and comes to terms with her love for the dog. As his last wish, Kalb becomes a djinn and joins Djinni within the lamp."
