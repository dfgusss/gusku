    "overview": "Despite growing up in a single-parent household, Maria was never that close with her mother. As an adult herself, she is thrust into being responsible after her mother suddenly dies. As she sorts through her mother’s belongings, she finds CDs, photographs, a diary, and an unplayable demo tape named “MARIA” that her mother had collected when she was around Maria’s age. Curious about her mother’s past, Maria heads to a live music club and this is where she encounters the musical culture of… Visual Kei."
