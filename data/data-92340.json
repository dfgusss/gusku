    "overview": "A lone man sits in a darkened room, bathed only in the cold, flickering glow of a television. As he watches, the images on the screen blur and distort, merging with shadows that creep across the walls. Strange, surreal scenes flash before him—familiar faces morph, landscapes twist into unrecognizable shapes, and sounds echo as if from a distant, warped reality. Detached and transfixed, he becomes lost in a hypnotic loop, questioning whether he’s watching the screen or if the screen is watching him."
