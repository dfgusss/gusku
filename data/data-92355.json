    "overview": "The situation in the city of Medan is not conducive because there is a feud between five big gangs seeking influence and power. They are the Batak Gang that controls Central Medan, the Javanese Gang that controls North Medan, the Chinese Gang that controls East Medan, the Indian Gang that controls South Medan, and the Malay Gang that controls West Medan. The Chinese Gang Leader wants to match his younger brother, Kenzo, with Indian Gang Leader Rakesh's younger sister Anjali. They secretly want to unite the territories they have previously controlled. However, Binsar, the leader of the Batak Gang, strongly opposed the match."
