    "overview": "Brothers, Pete and Norm Stuckey, will do anything to make sure their brand-new make-up startup is successful. Pass out flyers, hit-up social media influencers...and even borrow money from their town's local loan shark. With the clock ticking to pay him back, and their product missing days before their company launch, they'll have to turn to a late-night, infomercial 'fixer' to save their business...and their lives."
