    "overview": "Ade has suffered from a rare condition known as Blink Arrest Syndrome since she was a child—a disorder that leaves her unable to open her eyes at will, sometimes for five or six hours at a time. Now, at seventeen, she's in the midst of her most intense episode yet: three days without opening her eyes. Told in her own voice, the story follows Ade as she traces her journey from the first diagnosis to the present moment, pausing along the way to reflect on her relationship with Elira. In revisiting these pivotal experiences, she searches for meaning—something that might help her understand her condition and, with any luck, finally open her eyes."
