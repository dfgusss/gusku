    "overview": "A documentary short that illuminates the power of comedy, and the lengths comedians will go to inspire laughter while expressing the truth-where freedom of expression is a literal fight for freedom. Centered in Cairo, the entertainment hub of the Middle East, DIE LAUGHING follows 'Saturday Night Live Arabia', which dared to deliver the kind of cultural humor the American version is known for, 'Red Tomato', a troupe of European and Egyptian street clowns, and 'The Street Children', who post satirical sketches to social media. Watch as these artists balance humor with caution, knowing every punchline and each performance could land them in jail."
