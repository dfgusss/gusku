    "overview": "It tells the inspiring story of Juan Dávila. At the age of 32, he left his steady job as a municipal police officer to devote himself to show business. Thus began a ten-year journey performing in bars, squares, variety halls, and some theaters. A journey in which he started a theater company (Improclan) where he brought together people who, like him, were looking for their niche as comedians."
