    "overview": "Chelsea is an American visiting England for work. While inspecting an old estate for its real estate potential, she notices some strange lights in the cellar. She discovers a \"portal\" of sorts that shows her the past (end of 1700s) and the dashing owner of the old estate. When an accident occurs, the gentleman (Charles) comes through and gets stuck in the present day."
