    "overview": "An elderly woman, confined to a nursing home, is about to celebrate her birthday. While the cold-blooded staff celebrates her birthday in advance, the radio announces the escape of the extremely dangerous killer known as \"El Matarife\" from a mental hospital. El Matarife—whose connection to the woman is closer than it seems—will unleash a massacre in the nursing home to deliver a very special gift to her."
