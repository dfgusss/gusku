One day, she is unpleasantly surprised to learn that her neighbor Alicia has suddenly died. Overwhelmed by financial problems, Claudia tells Dori about Necromancy, the ritual by which one can consult the dead about the future. Dori agrees to this practice, thinking that her financial problems will soon be solved. But what she doesn't know is that desecrating the sleep of the dead can have terrifying consequences."
