    "overview": "Lalo Schifrin was born in Buenos Aires in 1932. His birth is musical, since his father and uncles were members of the stable orchestra of the Colón theater. His training is classical and his passion for jazz emerged as a teenager. He traveled to France at the age of 20, after winning a scholarship to study at the National Conservatory. After this training of excellence, he created a monumental work that brought him fame and toured the main stages of the world, both with his music for film and television and with his jazz or classical works. From his home in Beverly Hills we propose to accompany him on this journey of memory and feelings, letting his music be the guide on this path."
