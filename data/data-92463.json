    "overview": "After her mother’s death, young Ying Nuo’s relationship with her father became distant and tense. Years later, she returned to her hometown with her five-year-old daughter, Diu Diu, with the hope to leave Diu Diu with her father so that she could go abroad to attend competition. However, her father rejected her for various reasons, forcing Ying Nuo to stay in her hometown temporarily. Yet, behind the warm and harmonious community life, both the father and the daughter have their own hidden concerns… The film takes the idea of “palliative care” as a starting perspective to depict the pain and warmth experienced by an ordinary family when facing separation and loss."
