    "overview": "A film about surviving something that didn’t go as expected. Manuel is going through a break-up with Camila, and, at the same time, he has to rethink the whole artistic project that has been his focus for the last few years. To give Camila space to pack, he leaves for a seaside location, where he continues his preoccupation with recording sounds of all kinds. His inertia about the future will be challenged by something extraordinary that happens to him on the beach."
