    "overview": "A once-in-a-moment recording of the rock legends as they performed a surprise gig at the iconic Shepherd’s Bush Empire in June 1999. Announced only as they were preparing to play two nights at nearby behemoth Wembley Stadium that same month, it saw a small crowd of 1800 lucky fans treated to an intimate show in which the band eschewed their big hits in favour of rarely heard gems. This was a gig with many firsts; songs included Saint of Me, I Got the Blues and Brand New Car, while Melody was performed for the first time since 1977 and Moon Is Up brought to the stage for the only time in the band’s live career. Sheryl Crow, who opened the show, joined the band for a special rendition of Honky Tonk Women. As Mick Jagger shouted from the stage that night “If you want to see the hits, go to the big place down the road”. As promised, they didn’t disappoint."
