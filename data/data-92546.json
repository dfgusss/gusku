    "overview": "In the late ‘70s, in the midst of the military dictatorship, a surrealist literary work- shop is the oasis of Martín, a tormented young man who seeks to improve his poetry. Caron, a brilliant and eccentric writer, adopts him as a son. Their bond is recorded in short home movies and an unusual correspondence."
