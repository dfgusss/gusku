    "overview": "This is the extraordinary story of Britain’s postwar atomic weapons programme and its devastating legacy. The film reveals the full extent of the British government’s nuclear tests in Australia and the South Pacific in the 1950s and 1960s.  39,000 British and Commonwealth servicemen witnessed 45 atomic and hydrogen bombs and hundreds of radioactive experiments. The documentary exposes the debilitating health conditions that have blighted the lives of veterans, descendants and indigenous communities ever since."
