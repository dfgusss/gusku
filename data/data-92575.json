    "overview": "Ciko, a film editor, faces a major dilemma when tasked with cutting several scenes of the lead actor due to acting flaws. Secretly, Jagad, the director, asks Ciko to edit the actor out of the film entirely, without the knowledge of Tasya, the producer. The situation becomes even more complicated as the actor is a special request from an important investor. During the preview, the investor demands more scenes of the actor, threatening to withdraw funding if his request is ignored. Tensions escalate as Tasya and Jagad clash over the final cut of the film, with Ciko caught in the middle. Feeling there is no way out, Ciko ultimately decides to leave the project."
