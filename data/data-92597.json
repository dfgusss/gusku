    "overview": "Twenty-six years after her parents' dramatic break-up, film director Nicoline Skotte takes on the task of revisiting her childhood trauma by inviting her parents to participate in an investigation of shared family dynamics. Memories of their common past seem to be selectively edited by each individual. What led to this dramatic outcome and how did two such incompatible people ever end up together? Nicoline dives into the messy family relations, seeking to uncover what has never been said."
