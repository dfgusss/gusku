While waiting, Nami lives with her father-in-law, Gengoro, who uses her nightly as he pleases. One day, a man named Kaneda washes up at the port, in hiding after committing a heinous sex crime, and begins to work for a fisherman named Kunio. While Kaneda is doing his best to reform his life, all hell breaks loose when he crosses paths with Nami, and his natural urges kick back in."
