Over time, she became an international figure. However, today, with more than twenty years of experience, DANNA decides to take control of her own career, and a new artist rises from the ashes. Throughout a year of work, alongside with the recording of her latest album, we delve into her intimate world to discover the rebirth of this star who shines like never before. \"We Have to Talk\" is a reflective and musical journey into the heart of a talented and multifaceted artist, who opens her soul to present us with her new dawn."
