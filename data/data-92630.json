    "overview": "Across North America, local communities are taking back their mountains, redefining the spirit of skiing and snowboarding at its core. Mountains Not for Profit, a short documentary by Teton Gravity Research in collaboration with the Indy Pass, dives into the stories of four non-profit ski areas that have flipped the script on corporate-driven snow culture. Shames Mountain (BC), Whaleback (NH), Black Mountain of Maine, and Antelope Butte (WY) are proof that passion, grit, and community can keep the soul of skiing alive. These mountains thrive on volunteer effort, donations, and the sheer joy of carving turns. This is grassroots skiing at its finest—where people and purpose drive the powder days."
