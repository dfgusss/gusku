    "overview": "A documentary about Finnish light artist Kari Kola constructing the worlds largest light installation in Connemara, Ireland.  The city of Galway has commissioned a work from Kari as a part of their European Capital of Culture 2020 program. The city asks him to do \"something big\" and Kari decides to light up a whole mountain. The art piece is named Savage Beauty, an expression used by Oscar Wilde to describe the Connemara region. Kola and his team face challenges ranging from weather to bureaucracy and finally a world-wide pandemic.  Kari Kola, often an outsider underdog, wants to prove that once you find your strengths and apply some grit and finnish sisu, nothing is impossible."
