    "overview": "Popular's new musical production, “Lo que nos une” (What Unites Us), presents music as a unifying element in which Puerto Ricans on the island or abroad can see themselves. This new musical proposal combines renowned artists with a new generation of performers who provide a varied and refreshing approach to the musical special. The featured landscapes, as well as the musical selection, make this a remarkable production, not only for the nostalgia it will evoke in those who no longer live on the island but also for the cherished memories that these iconic songs will bring to the audience."
