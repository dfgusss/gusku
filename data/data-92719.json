    "overview": "Germany holds the largest collection of Cameroonian cultural objects in the world in its Ethnological museums. One important piece is 'Mandu Yenu' the Royal Throne of Bamum, a striking work adorned with glass beads and cowrie shells, also known as the Pearl Throne. What should be done with this masterwork and other pieces overshadowed by their colonial heritage?"
