    "overview": "In the ’90s, pop culture icon Susan Powter burst onto the scene with her signature bleach-blonde buzz cut and bold message of health and wellness. After conquering infomercials, becoming a New York Times bestselling author, hosting her own talk show, and seeing her face on thousands of products, she dramatically walked away from Hollywood and into obscurity. Crippling lawsuits with her business partners left her bankrupt, and she has since lived as a total recluse below the poverty line in Las Vegas, where the filmmaker ultimately finds her. This documentary explores the meteoric rise and subsequent fall of Susan Powter while asking what it will take to bring her back to audiences—and whether her message, Stop The Insanity, is still as relevant and powerful today as it was in the early ’90s."
