    "overview": "On December 23, you can meet Santa Claus almost anywhere - even on the Berlin-Bayern long-distance bus. But driver Robert, himself wearing a Santa hat, doesn't promise any presents. 25-year-old Felix, a new Berliner, is on his way to snowy Mittenwald to celebrate Christmas with his family and girlfriend. He is already planning his personal present: a marriage proposal to his girlfriend Saskia. But shortly before departure, a mishap occurs - the engagement ring goes missing. Felix's seatmate Hanna, who is also traveling to Mittenwald to spend the party with her grandmother, has just ended a relationship. The freedom-loving Hanna begins a casual flirtation with Felix, of all people, who is in a long-term relationship and doesn't at all fit in with her prey scheme. Over the next few years, their paths cross again on the Christmas drive home."
