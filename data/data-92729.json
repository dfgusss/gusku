    "overview": "Krisna, a young man from a wealthy family who has just returned from studying abroad, falls in love at first sight when he sees Indira, a singer, at his family's café. Indira reciprocates his feelings, and they fall in love and begin a secret relationship because their relationship is opposed by Krisna's mother, Gayatri, who tries to separate them by sending Krisna to Korea. Krisna is overjoyed when he learns that Indira is pregnant with their love child, but Gayatri finds out about the pregnancy and forces Indira to abort the child, as Gayatri does not want their extended family and business associates to know that their grandchild is going to be born from the womb of a café singer."
