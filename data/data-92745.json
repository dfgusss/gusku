Aoli, who has been living in Beijing, rushed back to her hometown of Macao. Her grandmother, who had raised her since childhood, was seriously ill, and her family was busy with their own affairs, making Aoli, a freelancer, the best person to take care of her grandmother. The two of them spent a wonderful time together in the Lucky Pavilion, but the stagnation of their careers made Aoli feel anxious, as if her grandmother was becoming a drag on her...
