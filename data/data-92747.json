    "overview": "Registration of the sixth comedy special by the Dutch comedian Henry van Loon. When Henry van Loon got his dog Jannie, a global pandemic broke out not long after and he was suddenly stuck indoors with that nervous little guy. His daughter was born in the middle of that pandemic. A tough time, that's for sure. But also a time for reflection. Time to think about what he really wanted. And you know what that was? Away! On the road again."
