    "overview": "Duke, the long lost son of serial killer John Wayne Gacy aka The Killer Clown, contacts his estranged father hoping he can help him become a better serial killer. So far Duke has proven to be a failure. Every time he tries to kill somebody they either escape, or he ends up being beat up and humiliated by the intended victim. John Gacy, who didn't know Duke existed, soon realizes his \"long lost son\" is a complete idiot. So he decides to ask his friend and fellow serial killer, Dean Corll aka The Candy Man, for help."
