    "overview": "Boy Kaldag, a man infamous for his massive manhood — a gift that drives women wild and sparks envy among men. As his legend grows, Boy Kaldag plunges into a world of lust and chaos that comes with being so well-endowed. From a difficult birth, because he gets stuck on the way out because of his enormous endowment, to what seems like a curse, which befalls all that have relations with him, he has a problematic life. He recounts his life story to a late-night naughty-podcast host."
