    "overview": "Ira lives with her mother, Linda. One day, without any rational explanation, a mystical incident causes Linda to behave like a madwoman—suffering physically and frequently hallucinating. Unable to cope with her mother's condition, Ira asks her siblings, Ara and Ari, to come home and help take care of their mother. Unfortunately, fate has other plans, and Linda eventually passes away."
