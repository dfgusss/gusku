    "overview": "Gema’s suicide attempt brings her three children together after many years, on the eve of an unusually cold Christmas in Guadalajara. Cristina, stubborn and deeply Catholic, sees herself as their mother’s caretaker; Sony, a psychic on the local Latino TV channel, fled as far as she could over twenty years ago and never came back; and Brunito, the much younger one, a frustrated biologist and forty-something gay man still dreaming of finding the love of his life. A cold front moves in and traps them inside the house, threatening to bring back the family’s most painful memory—and place it right on the table."
