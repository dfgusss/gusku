    "overview": "A group of young, ambitious candidates for a special police unit in Baden-Württemberg are driven to perform at their best. One of them is 23-year-old Rebecca Henselmann, who will soon be deployed in undercover operations. She works hard and is ambitious, just like her colleague Christoph Laurin, whom Rebecca is getting to know. The young policewoman is highly motivated in her operations against drug and arms trafficking. In the process, she encounters abuses of power and encounters right-wing extremist attitudes in the police force too."
