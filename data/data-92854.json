    "overview": "Dito and Martha are two secret agents from PUANAS (National Agency Center), the lowest-ranking secret agency in Indonesia. Ironically, because of this low status, their data was spared from the massive hack that leaked intelligence information across the country. Seizing the opportunity, PUANAS takes on its biggest mission to uncover the nation's most troubling case—online gambling."
