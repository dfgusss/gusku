    "overview": "Mateus Lagoa and his wife Irene will celebrate their 20th wedding anniversary at a most luxurious resort on a tropical island, leaving their teenage son dangerously adrift. Before departure to paradise, during an unexpected night spent apart, the side effects of the vaccines strike them - fevers, fainting spells, shivers, hallucinations of all sorts. A melancholic mood creeps in and their world seems somehow fractured, capable of unsuspected and dangerous promises."
