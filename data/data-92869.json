    "overview": "In this hybrid docu-fiction, a group of young male rappers is invited to a tropical beach resort to participate in a film project under the guidance of an absent auteur. Without a script or assigned roles, they spend their days sunbathing and their nights producing music, aiming to advance their careers. As time progresses, the lack of direction leads to confusion and frustration among the musicians. Gradually, each is engulfed by profound and unsettling dreams, blurring the lines between reality and imagination."
