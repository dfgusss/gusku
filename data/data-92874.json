    "overview": "The line of succession is a matter not taken lightly. It is therefore expected that those in line to the throne, stand a good public eye. Queen Elizabeth the Second has died, and with Charles as our new king - the future is looking bright given the nature of our future kings of Britain. The monarchy has evolved, and has undergone a huge deal of change over the last 1000 years. The line of succession is one that is looking sharp, but is also one that is bound to change. The examples of the previous monarchs continue to build strong relationships for the generations of monarchs to come."
