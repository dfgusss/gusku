    "overview": "Sasha Rodionov, a sly cash-out operator from Moscow, owes money to a dangerous authority nicknamed Beekeeper. He does not forgive delays and deals harshly with debtors, so Sasha and his family flee to Dagestan under the witness protection program. But his wife and children are sure that this is an ordinary vacation, and now Sasha is forced to pass off a dilapidated barn in a mountain village as a fashionable eco-hotel. However, the popularity of the hotel gives away Rodionov's location to his ill-wishers."
