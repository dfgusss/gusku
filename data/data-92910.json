    "overview": "On April 24th, 2002 Ntare Guma Mbaho Mwine's car broke down in the small town of Mbirizi, Uganda. While waiting for the car's repair he stumbled upon a small photo studio and met photographer Kibaate Aloysius Ssalongo, whose work spanned from the late 1950's up till 2006 when he passed away. This chance encounter turned into a 22 year journey documenting and exploring Kibaate's life and photography and the profound impact it had on Ntare's life and the lives of the entire community he documented."
