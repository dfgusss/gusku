    "overview": "Award-winning stand-up comedian Mark Nelson’s triumphant homecoming gig in the sold-out Theatre Royal in Dumfries.  From growing up in the south west of Scotland in the 90s and bringing his wife back to the city to revisit the nightclubs of his youth, to becoming a family man on the road to middle age, Mark delivers a barrage of jokes detailing his life through the ages and the challenges facing modern Scotland.  Outrageous punchlines are surrounded by sharp observations, which have the packed theatre in stitches from beginning to end."
