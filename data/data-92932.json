    "overview": "Amy is the overworked assistant of fashion mogul, Vanessa Silver. So, it’s a shock when Vanessa tells Amy that she plans to name her as her successor, rather than her party-girl daughter Blair. Even more of a shock is when Vanessa turns up dead the next morning. Learning that Vanessa updated her will to give 90% of the company to Amy and only 10% to Blair, Amy’s boyfriend Kevin is apprehensive about this change, especially as Amy becomes the prime suspect in Vanessa’s mysterious death. As Blair begins to receive threats, Amy fluctuates between thinking the threats are fake and suspecting a disgruntled former employee as the culprit–until Blair is attacked at work, leaving Amy is the culprit in yet another case."
