With gunshots piercing their walls, a newly pregnant Marcela, her husband, and their young son are left with no choice but to comply with their captors’ demands: surrender $200,000 or their lives. But with no means of accessing that sort of money, Marcela faces insurmountable odds to protect her family from their violent captors and must make the life and death decisions to keep her family safe."
