One day he returns from Tokyo to Bangkok and reunites with Kai whom he had feelings for when they were students. Kai is active as a photographer and also pursuing music when they reunite. This makes Sota a bit nervous. Kai, however, is surprised that Sota recalls the 'unfinished song' he once sang for him. The duo slowly grow closer once again, but each have a secret as to why they can't complete the song. Yet this unfinished song connecting the two of them begins to resonate with both once again!"
