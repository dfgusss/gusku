    "overview": "In a Valencian village, during the postwar period, Ana tries to get ahead with her family; the civil war has opened a deep wound in all of them, especially in her brother-in-law, Antonio. Ana tries to heal that wound with stews, secrets and silences, but when Isabel, newly married to Antonio, comes to the family, Ana’s attention and care will be worth little or nothing: the sacrifice does not always have its reward."
