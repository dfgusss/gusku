    "overview": "Combatants for Peace, nominated for two Nobel Peace Prizes, is an extraordinary bi-national group of former enemy combatants—Israelis and Palestinians—working together during an ongoing armed conflict. Faced with escalating devastation and violence, the very core of the movement must face great challenges and show that there is another way. The first question they have to face is their own belief…is this possible?"
