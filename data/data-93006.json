    "overview": "The peace of Donghai City was shattered by a gang shootout, as the duo assassins, Chainsaw and Yangyang, stormed a money house and emptied its assets. The assassins were acting under the orders of corporate mogul Zhao Ping'an, in a classic case of betrayal among criminals. Meanwhile, SWAT teams were deployed, setting up an inescapable dragnet. Under heavy resistance, the authorities successfully apprehended the criminals, completely thwarting the international conglomerate's attempt to transfer their assets."
