    "overview": "Three ghosts come together to answer a question: how did we get to the Brazil we are today? The three men summoned are: Fernando, a bohemian family man and collaborator of the military dictatorship; Arnaud, a teenager who got involved with a group of vigilantes; Sebastião, a black and gay photographer who lost the love of his life. The Secret Life of My Three Men is a historical drama that questions Brazil's identity in the face of its history and legacy of violence and, through poetry, creates the possibility of another reality."
