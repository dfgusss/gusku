    "overview": "Albi initially only admired Shella from afar. Over time, their relationship developed, with Albi becoming a figure who was always there for Shella, especially when Shella discovered a lump in her stomach which turned out to be a cyst, and was later diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Their love was tested by increasingly serious illnesses, but Albi never gave up. Even in the most difficult times, he chose to marry Shella, showing that true love can survive the toughest storms."
