    "overview": "What happens when ideology overtakes biology? \"Identity Crisis\" dives into one of the most polarizing debates of our time: the rise of gender ideology and its impact on children. Inspired by the cultural phenomenon \"What Is a Woman?,\" this emotionally charged documentary shares deeply personal accounts from detransitioners, parents, and professionals fighting against a system that prioritizes political agendas over child welfare. \"Identity Crisis\" urgently invites viewers to reconsider the cost of reshaping identity."
