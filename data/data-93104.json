Beautifully filmed at the Palace Theatre Southend-on-Sea, this triumphant show played The London Palladium and over 70 venues throughout the UK and in Australia.  Fascinating Aïda have racked-up millions of internet followers, performed in the world’s most prestigious venues and been showered with awards and plaudits since they sashayed onto the scene back in 1983. Uniquely charming, with diamond-sharp satire, filthy, hilarious, belligerent, political, poignant and outrageous, this indomitable trio are still the mistresses of their craft. The show features much-loved favourites like Dogging and Cheap Flights plus wickedly hilarious new songs like AI, Tory MP and Citizenship Test ... Don't miss the chance to celebrate with these unstoppable performers in their glorious prime!"
