    "overview": "On a night of heavy rain, seven people of all shapes stayed in a remote inn. Little did they know that danger came quietly after the night fell. At first, a running cook died mysteriously, and then people kept dying! The door of the strange inn in the middle of the night was closed by heavy rain, and it turned into a killing game full of suspicion. The people with ghosts searched for the real culprit in the continuous death threats, and the situation was reversed again and again!"
