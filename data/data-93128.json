    "overview": "\"Il suffit d'écouter les femmes\": these famous words were pronounced by Simone Veil when she defended her law on abortion, in 1974, before the National Assembly. For the first time, women who have used a clandestine abortion in France before 1975 evoke their painful, release or traumatic experience. These moving testimonies make it possible to discover the incredible diversity of the means employed, the dangers incurred, the participation of children, the role of men, that of doctors, sometimes even the violence committed on women."
