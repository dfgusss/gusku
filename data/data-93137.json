    "overview": "In his final moments, elderly Fernando falls into a trance where his mind, like a wandering ghost, finds refuge in an old palace from the last century. In the middle of an imposing hall, photographs of his youth are projected: beach vacations, birthdays, and portraits of his beloved Ani, who left long before him. Two female figures appear on the projection, invoking a ritual where the living and the dead meet again, and where our gaze is both complicit and participatory in this final family reunion."
