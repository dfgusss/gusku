    "overview": "Yukari, a 27-year old fujoshi fangirl who loves the popular yakiniku-themed pretty boy anime \"Meat is Mine\", ends up meeting Rai, a pretty but enigmatic bar hostess. As they become friends and roommates in Kabukicho, Yukari starts to get concerned about how Rai doesn't take care of herself and keeps talking about death. Yukari wants to make Rai less suicidal by finding her ex-boyfriend, who she suspects Rai still isn't over.  At the same time Yukari attempts to date a decent guy, pressured by her mother and thinking that love might be the answer to set her life straight. Nevertheless, she ends up spending a lot of time with Rai's friend Asahi, a cheery and friendly (but married) host club boy.  Based on the novel by Hitomi Kanehara."
