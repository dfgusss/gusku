    "overview": "When the regime of Laika was changing, black and white undercurrents were surging. Some people wanted to make a fortune, some wanted to use this to whitewash, some wanted to escape from Laika, and some wanted to establish a foothold in Laika... The police placed an undercover police officer, Zheng Zha, lurking among the biggest black force in Laika, Boss Song, but they didn't know that there were others who wanted to take this opportunity to take revenge on Boss Song."
