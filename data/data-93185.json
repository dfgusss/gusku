    "overview": "Convinced she’s cursed to die before turning thirty, Haya lives life at maximum volume: reckless, funny, chaotic, and completely unfiltered. After one of her many over-the-top stunts lands her in the emergency room, she collides with Youssef, a brilliant but emotionally shut-down heart surgeon who lives by rules, routines, and zero surprises. Certain the universe has thrown them together for a reason, Haya barrels into his perfectly controlled world like a glitter bomb, dragging him through neon nights, strange rituals, awkward encounters, unexpected tenderness, and a growing emotional glitch neither of them planned for. As her personal countdown looms and his frozen life starts to thaw, their unlikely connection turns into a wild, funny, and oddly uplifting ride through fear, fate, and the messy joy of being alive played at full speed."
