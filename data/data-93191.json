    "overview": "Creator of absolute freedom, David Lynch constructed his work as an enigma to be deciphered between dream and reality. A cult director from his first films (\"Eraserhead\", \"Elephant Man\", \"Blue Velvet\"), Lynch forever changed the world of television with his series \"Twin Peaks\", before tackling the lies of Hollywood in \"Mulholland Drive\". Tracing the life of the most influential filmmaker of his generation, this documentary explores the hidden meaning of a relentlessly consistent filmography and delves beneath the dark, teeming surface of the American Dream."
