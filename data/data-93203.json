    "overview": "A queer performance for transforming violence into healing. A traditional dance and its costumes to counter colonial legacies. A peaceful ritual for diluting the imposing masculinity of the cockfighting arena, their sharp damaging spurs, their intense cigar sucking. The Nicaraguan multidisciplinary artist Elyla, amidst masks and fumes, creates a purifying and festive prayer, a serene ceremony of alternativity for tending death."
