    "overview": "Three elderly people, all feeling the strain of life, accidentally come together. Two men, one woman. They are Woo-sick, Hyung-jun, and Hwa-jin. Their sole goal is to \"grease their insides\" by eating pork all around Seoul. Their mission is clear: to dine without paying a cent! As they enjoy free meat, their faces brighten up, they feel alive, and most importantly, they've made friends! Their friendship deepens as time passes."
