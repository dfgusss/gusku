    "overview": "The refugee, the fled, the persecuted. The hidden, the migrant, the foreigner. The newcomer, seen with distrust, looks of fear and suspicion. In this evocative sand animation by filmmaker Pedro Serrazina, shadows, contrasts and a disturbing sound construction relive ancestral prejudices of the other, so ancient and so present. Clandestine words, whispered phrases, memories written on winter nights by candlelights."
