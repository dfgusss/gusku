    "overview": "Ivan Ilyich is a social climbing magistrate in 19th century Russia. After suffering a seemingly innocuous injury, his life enters a tailspin. He starts questioning his relationships, his work, the very meaning of life. As he deteriorates, he begins to grasp how the good life ought to have been, and how he had never truly lived it."
