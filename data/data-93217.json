    "overview": "Akane Kinoshita is a university student, who was recently dumped by her ex-boyfriend. She is still heart broken by the rejection. She meets high school student & professional gamer Akito Yamada through an online game. At first, she thinks he is blunt and cold to people, but he sometimes shows his gentler side with her, like putting a band-aid on her wound or carrying her on his back when she gets drunk. Due to this, she gradually becomes attracted to him ... but Akito Yamada has zero interest in romance."
