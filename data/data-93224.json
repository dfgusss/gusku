    "overview": "An old man attempting to harm the village's mystical guardian tree. An office worker, obsessed with beauty, tampering with her neighbor's packages. A mother making deals with ghosts to secure her daughter's place in medical school. A senior police officer insisting on handling a case alone, despite his junior's objections. A college student seeking fame on social media through horror content. These seemingly unrelated incidents are eerily linked by their intertwined relationships and a shared undercurrent of wrong choices driven by desire. At the heart of it all lies a sinister dark market. Once its true nature is revealed, there’s no turning back."
