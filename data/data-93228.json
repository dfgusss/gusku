    "overview": "A decade ago, Cheung Lek was the brightest rising boxing star—known as “Golden Boy”—until a tragic incident stripped him of his freedom. Ten years later, released from prison, he comes face to face with Fong Yuen, the son he has never met. To claim the inheritance left by Fong Yuen’s mother, Cheung must learn to live with and take care of the boy. Thrust into fatherhood and confronted by past regrets, Cheung’s life is turned upside down once more. Through conflict and gradual reconciliation with his son, he begins to understand his true purpose. Confronting the ghosts of his past, Cheung decides to return to the ring—not only to reclaim his dream, but to become the role model his son deserves."
