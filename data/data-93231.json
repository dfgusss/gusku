    "overview": "Forty-year-old Julia, a successful conductor, and her partner Georg are longing for a child when Dr. Vilfort, a fertility specialist with a private clinic, offers them hope with an experimental procedure. Julia becomes pregnant after successful treatment at the clinic. However, the birth does not go as planned and the baby is immediately taken away for additional treatment, leaving Julia and her husband in the dark about what has happened. When Julia is finally reunited with the child, she feels strangely distant. The baby’s presence puts a strain on their marriage as it becomes clear that Julia has doubts about whether the baby they have brought home is really hers."
