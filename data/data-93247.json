She’s welcomed by A.J. and Isaac, two new friends of Camille, who also maybe live there. The group promises a weekend of homemade meals from fresh, local produce and parlor games by candlelight.  But when Yvonne develops troubling symptoms from a tick bite, the rural paradise fades away revealing a breeding ground for a disturbing new life."
