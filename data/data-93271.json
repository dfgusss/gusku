    "overview": "During a night shift, security guard Kiriyama watches a popular live streaming show titled '#Iwilltellyouthetruth' from the guardroom. The show is known for exposing the hidden truths behind sensational incidents and gossip, offering cash rewards and tips in return. The more shocking the revelation, the hotter the viewer reaction—and the greater the payout. In desperate need of money, Kiriyama decides to join the program and is eventually selected as a participant. However, what he faces is a truth far more immense and unimaginable than he ever anticipated. Truth always draws people in, but sometimes it can consume everything in its path. Depending on how people react, it may even reveal an entirely different face."
