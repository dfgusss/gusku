    "overview": "The conductor starts a symphony by the Swedish composer Hugo Alfvén in front of a sea of ​​graying heads. But playing to an aging crowd is proving to have its challenges. Questions about the survival and relevance of classical music are brought to a head in a satire that feels relatable to anyone who has visited the country's cultural institutions."
