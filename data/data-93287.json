These three imaginary stories draw their reference from prototypes of more or less known women who participated in the Bardo sit-in, will be treated as a fiction against a backdrop of historical events whose images will be drawn from the archives of this period that marked the short history of Tunisia, after the revolution.  Thus highlighting the journey of the three characters and that of a country in full turmoil."
