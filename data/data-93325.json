    "overview": "NORMA PEÑA (57), a polio survivor, faces mortal danger when a storm destroys their backup generator, cutting power to her iron lung. The iron lung is a horizontal mechanical ventilator that breathes for her. Without it, she only has a few hours before her body gives out.  LUISA PEÑA (59), Norma’s sister, is her caretaker who keeps the iron lung running. Luisa quickly ascertains they have no power, they’re isolated due to the flooding, and emergency services are useless."
