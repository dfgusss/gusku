    "overview": "A man with somewhat antisocial behavior and a particularly rude and harsh style of dealing with his clients falls in love with the wrong person, who is also his customer. He is a car junkie on the outskirts, while she is a young actress on the rise. They are brought together by an old car, which to the young actress remains as a memory from her grandfather. After initial rejection, he's the only guy in town who can fix that old timer, and she's the only one who makes him realize that cars might not be the center of the world."
