    "overview": "She is the toughest officer in the Vienna police force. He would be the smartest heir to the throne Austria has ever had. But this double murder pushes the unusual investigative duo to their limits and beyond. After the double murder of high-ranking civil servants Ehrlacher and März in the Vienna Woods, Lieutenant Colonel Nassau and Major Malzer are tasked with discreetly investigating whether the victims were involved in criminal activities. During a search of Ehrlacher's apartment, Nassau shoots one of the attackers. The attacker bears the tattoo of a mafia organization that has been considered dismantled for years. The same tattoos are also discovered during the autopsies of the victims."
