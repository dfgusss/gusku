    "overview": "At Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, a man jumps over a barrier. Within seconds, five police officers catch him and push him to the ground. He laughs loudly. Evidently, this is exactly what he was aiming for. Dario is disappointed with current climate policies and sees only one solution: strike out and resist. His resistance has already led to several outstanding criminal proceedings against him in Germany. A request from Switzerland comes at just the right moment to prove himself further: the activist group “Klimastreik” is looking for someone who is willing to commit a “crime”."
