    "overview": "John, released from prison into the unforgiving North-West of 1986, finds himself abandoned by his family and homeless. When John returns to his childhood church, he comes across Father Upton preaching fire and brimstone from the pulpit, and becomes enthralled by the display of sadism. Believing himself worthy of the divine punishment that Upton offers, John pursues the priest and attempts to provoke him, through a most heinous act."
