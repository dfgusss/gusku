    "overview": "A queer reimagining of the French classic La Piscine, in which four former friends and lovers reunite on a hot summer weekend, reigniting long-simmering passions, grievances, and regrets. Olivia, a modern dancer, is vacationing with her husband, Seb, at a secluded country house, when they are paid an unexpected visit by Olivia’s former best friend and, briefly Seb’s lover, Mateo, whose own dance career ended after a serious injury. They haven’t seen or heard from one other in eight years since Mateo cut Olivia and Seb off after a painful betrayal. Adding to this emotionally fraught reunion, Mateo brings along his young and very sexy lover, Zaki. When two more former dance colleagues, Gabriella and her husband and Fabian, Olivia’s lover before Seb, pay a surprise visit, everyone’s romantic and sexual pasts, and desires, collide."
