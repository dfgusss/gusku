    "overview": "In \"Stealing the land\", parents fight not only for a better future for their children, but also for their own egos. When a schoolyard game sparks a political debate in the kitchen, an evening of absurd conflicts, low blows and unexpected confrontations begins. The film unrestrainedly provokes, entertains and exposes the grotesqueness of a society where the lines between play, education and the real world become dangerously blurred and the rules increasingly confusing - for children and adults alike."
