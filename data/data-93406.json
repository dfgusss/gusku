    "overview": "The life of the Cologne architect Mads is as empty as his apartment. Since the death of his beloved wife, the 44-year-old has only been able to function in a reduced daily routine. A chance reunion with his best friend from his youth changes everything. The cheerful single woman René moves in with him with her children - nine-year-old Lola and six-year-old Oscar. Finally, life is coming back into his life! Although René is not even considering the good-looking, successful guy as a new partner, Mads is growing into the unfamiliar role of the perfect patchwork dad. Friends without benefits, but with children - it works amazingly perfectly! When Mads becomes interested in the fascinating Eva, who is just as cautious as he is, an unwanted complication comes into the lightness of being: René receives a medical diagnosis that requires far-reaching decisions. Although he has other plans, Mads knows what he has to do."
