    "overview": "Giulio is a young adult trapped in a routine of precarious jobs and distant relationships. Torn between the weight of family expectations and his struggle to accept a life off the traditional tracks, Giulio drifts between tense conversations with his brother Andrea and lonely evenings working as a delivery rider for a small pizzeria. During a delivery to an enigmatic customer, Maurizio, an apparently insignificant event—an unexpected whisper—casts a shadow of mystery over Giulio’s daily monotony, opening space for reflections on his condition and the choices that have led him there."
