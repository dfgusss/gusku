And when he lost his lover and never returned, he was immersed in sadness, hopelessness, discouragement, lack of energy, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, was restless, and had liver problems. Until he started having health problems and led to the symptoms of being dead, \"not as energetic\" as before, causing great anxiety for his close friends \"Thep\" (Sutep Seesai) and \"Louis\" (Louis Chuanchuen).
