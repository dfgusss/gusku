    "overview": "On a street in Shinjuku, Tokyo. Yoshio, a musician bachelor, is drunk. Then he gets a phone call from his brother Satoshi, who tells him that his mother Michiko has attempted suicide and is in a coma. Yoshio decides to head for his hometown where he has not been back for years. He takes Maki, a woman he met that night at the Tama River.  They get off at the unmanned station, Ranshima. Yoshio and Maki walk in silence to the hospital where Michiko is. Michiko, however, is unconscious and asleep. Yoshio introduces Maki to his brother, Satoshi, as his own wife. Unlike Satoshi, who works for a company, Yoshio has no money, so it is all he can do to show his face. Yoshio and Maki's fake married life begins."
