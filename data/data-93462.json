    "overview": "Through distinguished testimonies, Magma - Matteotti, the Perfect Crime reconstructs a tumultuous period in our country's history, still shrouded in unresolved shadows. Starting from the murder of Christian Democrat politician Piersanti Mattarella, President of the Sicilian Region and brother of our current President, Sergio Mattarella—still without a culprit after 45 years—the film investigates the dark plots, the Red Brigades, rogue intelligence services, Gladio, and everything that simmered in the magma (chosen as a powerful symbol and narrative counterpoint) behind the violent deaths of Honorable Aldo Moro, magistrate and university professor Vittorio Bachelet (with firsthand testimony from Rosy Bindi, his assistant and direct witness to the attack), and the massacre at Bologna station—all events that occurred within the span of two years."
