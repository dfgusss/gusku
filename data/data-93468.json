    "overview": "A publishing powerhouse, Tory adopts a baby girl after failing to find a man who fills the void of not having the father she needed. Even a list of qualifying traits doesn’t help, so she gives up on dating, besides, she’s busy being a new mom while trying to prove herself as CEO and land a new hot children’s author. This prompts the Love Club to help Tory hire Finn, a nanny. But when the truth comes out that Finn was never really a nanny, the Love Club has to convince Tory that despite his lack of credentials Finn could be the children’s author and partner she was looking for."
