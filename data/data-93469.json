    "overview": "A pillar in her community and mother of two, Harper has never failed at anything she has set out to do, so when her husband asks for a separation, it throws off her whole world. When Colin, a divorced dad and community councilor seeking re-election, asks Harper for her help with his community initiatives, the Love Club encourages her to do it. Just when it seems sparks may actually ignite between these two, Colin takes credit for the initiative. Indignant, Harper throws her hat into the election ring and goes head-to-head with Colin. She recruits the Love Club as her campaign team, but although they champion her, they also step in to help Harper and Colin’s love blossom as a team."
