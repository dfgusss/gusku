    "overview": "Since her husband died three years earlier, Nila’s life has been all about her Instagram business and helicopter parenting her daughter Mara. Now a tween aching to break free, Mara creates a dating profile for her mom. Nila is horrified, but the Love Club agree it’s time Nila moved on. In order to make Mara and her Love Club friends happy, Nila agrees to date, but when all her dates bomb, she recruits local coffee shop owner Olly to be in a pretend relationship with her to get everyone off her case. But after discovering it’s a ruse, the Love Club decide to play Nila at her own game and create scenarios where Nila and Olly actually have to spend time as a couple."
