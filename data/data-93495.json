    "overview": "Since birth, Maryam's life has never been free from terror and the shadow of a genie. Until finally she received a mysterious letter that always appeared in front of her, the letter always appeared even though it had been thrown away, torn apart, even burned. She knew there was something invisible following her. The figure promised her not to leave her, clinging to her every step, whispering in a voice only she could hear. The more Maryam tried to run, the stronger the bonds held her back. Until slowly, she wasn't sure anymore... was she still living as herself, or did she belong to that figure forever?"
