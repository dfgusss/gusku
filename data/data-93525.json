    "overview": "Lena and her brother, Benhur, moved from Jakarta to Malang for college and stayed in a cozy boarding house owned by Mrs. Astri and Mr. Wiryo. Every week, all tenants gathered for a communal dinner. However, the peace turned into terror when a tenant had a strange dream and claimed the house was haunted, even seeing a hanging pocong. At first, no one believed it—until Lena saw it herself. This was no ordinary boarding house. The price to stay wasn’t money, but lives."
