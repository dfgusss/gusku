    "overview": "In Japan today, there is a demand for \"100 million people to become shareholders\" due to the \"20 million yen retirement problem\" and the spread of NISA and iDeCo. It is no exaggeration to say that we live in an age where \"billionaires\" are born through cryptocurrencies and stocks, and that anyone has the chance to become a billionaire."
