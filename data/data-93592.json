    "overview": "Unlike Buddy Bacon in the original 'Slaughterhouse' his brother Cleavon left the blood-splattered pig farm for a better life. But just like his father, Cleavon has a mute son who has a passion for home-reared, flame-grilled Wonder Jerky. Anyone who strays into Bacon's ranch, of abandoned Americana cars, will soon become part of the Wonder Jerky success story."
