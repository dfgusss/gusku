    "overview": "On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of Portorotondo (1964 – 2024), the documentary tells the story of this locality established by two Venetian brothers, Nicolò and Luigino Donà dalle Rose. Enamored with Poltu Ridundu, they transformed a perfectly round body of water into one of the most renowned tourist destinations in the world. Through interviews with illustrious figures such as writer Marcello Fois, Nicola Pietrangeli, Enrico Vanzina, and Carolina Rosi, the documentary explores the social, economic, and cultural revolution that completely transformed Gallura during the years of the economic and tourist boom."
