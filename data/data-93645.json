    "overview": "Edoardo and Ottavio were high school classmates and best friends, but 30 years have passed and they've long since lost touch. Edoardo has achieved great success, married Giovanna, and together they have three children, Giacomo, Emma, ​​and Lidia, who have grown up in a comfortable and overly spoiled environment. A bad investment, however, threatens to bankrupt him. Ottavio, on the other hand, has led a simpler and more humble life than his friend, but in times of need, he proves to be the only person willing to help Edoardo without asking for anything in return."
