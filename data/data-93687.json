    "overview": "Asahi, a fan of the live idol group \"RADICAL LILY POP,\" is especially a fan of member \"Emapi\". One day, Asahi meets fellow fan Nanami at a drinking party invited by fellow otaku Renjiro. While Nanami calls idols by their first names and wants to get close because she loves them, Asahi wants to keep her distance and worship her as a god because she loves her. Together with Renjiro, they discuss idol theory, but they don't quite get along. Eventually, Asahi realizes that Nanami likes women and isn't just a fan, but is also making advances on member \"Minorin\", and he senses the danger that she might get her way with \"Emapi,\" whom he is supporting."
