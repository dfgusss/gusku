    "overview": "the film „mandà in lunga“ follows a journey from Val Poschiavo, a valley in the Italian-speaking part of the Swiss canton of Grisons, up to the highest point of the Morteratsch Glacier, the largest glacier in the Bernina Range. Shot entirely on 16mm film and edited in-camera, the film captures the changing landscapes and atmospheric shifts along the way. The journey is musically accompanied by the organ drones and violin sounds of Laura and Luzius Schuler."
