    "overview": "A trained theologian with a truck driver's license joins Werner Träsch's team. Former pastor Matthias is surprisingly good at tackling difficult tasks. But he can't hide the fact that he is in trouble for long: His ex-girlfriend Anna makes it impossible for him to see their five-year-old daughter Lotte, despite having joint custody."
