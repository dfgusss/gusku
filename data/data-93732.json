    "overview": "School principal Hans is about to retire, but neither he nor his wife, Rita, are happy about their newly gained free time. For the past 35 years, their marriage has followed a well-established routine, with Rita setting the pace. As far as Rita is concerned, there is no reason to change anything. In fact, she does not like change at all. However, a stroke of fate reopens old wounds and forces them to ask themselves: Are they still a couple, or two separate individuals?"
