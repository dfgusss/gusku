    "overview": "Oliver, an elderly gardener with Alzheimer's, discovers a Super 8 film reel he recorded decades ago, during the early days of his relationship with Julia, his late wife. As he watches the images from the past, his memories blur with the present, and he finds himself torn between reality and the recollections of a love that still blooms in his mind. While searching for answers that never come, Oliver confronts the fleeting nature of life and the beauty of memories that withstand the passage of time."
