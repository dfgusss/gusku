    "overview": "This one means a lot to me. This film not only marks the break of a long hiatus from YouTube/filmmaking for me, but it is also the first film I have produced independently. I wrote the script a few weeks ago and began shooting shortly after.  I'd like to give a HUGE thank you to everyone who left their touch on this film. I would not have been able to make this without the support and commitment from you, and I especially would not have been able to make this at this level of quality without you. Thank you.  Thank you for watching! Check out my other content on Instagram and TikTok!  #shortfilm #film #comedy #studentfilm #studentfilmmaker #filmmaker #filmmaking"
