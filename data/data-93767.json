    "overview": "In personal reflections on her own experiences with sexual violence and in frank conversations with victims and (potential) perpetrators, Sunny Bergman shows how we as a society deal with sexual violence. Research shows that nearly a quarter of women have experienced sexual violence, but this is the tip of the iceberg. Why does rape almost always go unpunished? At the vice and in court we see how people get stuck in a system of 'His word against hers' and 'One witness is not a witness'. The new consent law is a step forward, but what makes the system fail time and time again?"
