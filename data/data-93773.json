    "overview": "Bringing a closure to his \"Healing Trilogy,\" Bladde offers up a beautifully bizarre tale of overcoming trauma. Through grizzly depictions of a decapitated head and symbolic references to the River Styx and even Saltburn, viewers watch as his character, The Illusionist, takes back the power stolen from them and strips themselves of the turmoil caused by a deeply repressed sexual assault."
