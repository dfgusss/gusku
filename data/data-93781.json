One day, when Young-beom encounters a mysterious elderly man in the neighborhood, strange miracles begin unfolding at home. Word spreads quickly, and the village turns to the family, hoping to share in their blessings. While the old man seems like their secret savior, the family soon learns that every blessing casts a shadow: this miracle is no gift or favor—it's a curse that threatens to tear their family apart."
