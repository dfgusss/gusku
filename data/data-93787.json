    "overview": "On the heights of a mountain in North Macedonia, in the midst of a flock of 600 sheep being watched over by huge dogs, stands a refuge. Children's laughter escapes from the precarious shelter. They are a brotherhood, ranging from ages eight to twenty. When they are not hard at work, they are playing and discussing the meaning of life. Is their future really here?"
