    "overview": "The film explores The Covered Wagon, an epic 1923 silent film with a new soundtrack, recorded by the Northern Arapaho Eagle Society led by Michael Ridgebear and the Boulder Symphony & Music Academy. The music retells the story from this Colorado tribe’s perspective and helps to reverse negative Native American stereotypes perpetuated over six centuries."
