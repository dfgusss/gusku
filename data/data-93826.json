    "overview": "During her latest elopement, Liliane immerses herself in her family memories. Shattered by regret, loneliness and family pain, she tries to reach Paris, but to no avail. Her faith, inherited then abandoned, comes to her at decisive moments, calling forth the profane despair of a woman rejected and invariably “in hell” for eternity."
