    "overview": "Improvised over the course of a single night in Paris, this short film follows Fanny and Alexis, who meet by chance on a warm August evening. Fanny doesn’t believe in second dates, always less magical than the first spark. To prove her wrong, Alexis proposes an unusual pact: to meet every week as if it were their very first time."
