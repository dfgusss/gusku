    "overview": "Yoshito Hiruma (31) (played by Amane Okayama), a part-time university lecturer, is forced to take care of his 10-year-old nephew, Kota, after being left in charge by his pregnant sister. However, before long, Kota disappears. When Yoshito finally manages to find him, he discovers that Kota has become disillusioned with reality and cryptically expresses his desire to “go somewhere else, anywhere but here.” Yoshito resonates with his words, and as their bond deepens, they delve further into Yoshito’s field of expertise—pessimism.  Together, they embark on an unusual cohabitation, finding a peculiar sense of enjoyment in their shared pessimism. But eventually, the worst tragedy imaginable befalls each of them."
