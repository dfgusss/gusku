    "overview": "Su-mi is unable to keep her mother hospitalised because her hospital bills continue to be delayed, and the hospital's 'interim settlement' forces her to discharge her. Believing that if she prays just a little more, her mother will recover, she causes a scene at the hospital and forcibly takes her mother home. Despite everything not going as planned, she refuses to give up hope that she can still send her mother on the flower tour starting next week."
