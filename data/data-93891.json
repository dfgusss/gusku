    "overview": "Paula and Raúl, who live with Dani, a six-year-old boy, could be just another couple... They could be, except that the boy is not Paula's son, and Paula faces the everyday challenge of proving that she deserves the title of mother. This conflict, along with the couple's separation and, as a result, the possibility that Paula might never see Dani again, sets up a story that puts the pain of a child at the heart of it."
