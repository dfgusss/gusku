    "overview": "Born in Roman Britain 1,500 years ago, a young man named Patrick embarked on an extraordinary mission that would change the course of history. Kidnapped from his wealthy Roman-British family and trafficked to Ireland, Patrick endured six years of brutal slavery. But a vision inspired his daring escape, taking him back across the Irish Sea to become a priest. Defying all odds, he then chose to return to Ireland, a decision that would have an enduring effect on the island’s culture and religious life."
