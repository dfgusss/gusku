    "overview": "A woman who has shut out the light of her emotions, Doah. Amid a bitter divorce and custody battle, she locks every feeling into darkness using the \"Gray Rock\" strategy. As a school counselor, she heals students’ wounds while hardening her own pain into cold stone, concealing cracks in her identity between a demanding mother and an emotionally numb workplace. Everything holds—until a single outburst during a visit with her daughter fractures her armored shell."
