    "overview": "In 2024, Jasmin Paris made history by becoming the first woman to finish the Barkley Marathons, widely known as one of the hardest races in the world and a defining test in ultrarunning and trail running. With over 100 miles of brutal terrain, cryptic course markings, and a near-impossible success rate, the Barkley has long been considered the ultimate challenge in endurance sports. The Finisher\" chronicles Jasmin’s extraordinary three-year journey (2022–2024) to achieve this groundbreaking feat."
