    "overview": "Top student Aoi Osaka, a third-year calligraphy club member, unexpectedly fails her early university entrance exam. Just as she’s about to give up, Tasuku Murase—a cheerful basketball club member who also failed—reaches out. Both aiming for the law faculty, their only chance lies in a second exam in three days, consisting solely of a competitive essay. With no preparation and only ten spots available, Aoi is ready to give up—until Tasuku encourages her to meet Sayama Gaku, a Japanese teacher and basketball coach, for help. Though polar opposites, Aoi and Tasuku embark on an intense crash course together, seeking redemption and perhaps something more."
