    "overview": "Prime Minister Alma Solvik gets caught up in a scandal before elections. During Alma's term in power, her husband Sondre has done transactions on the stock exchange apparently using the government's inside information. Alma puts together a crisis communication HQ that formulates the tactics for communicating with the public. The Prime Minister is also a prime minister at home and therefore they launch the campaign \"Sondre is the culprit\" – the elections must be won, after all."
