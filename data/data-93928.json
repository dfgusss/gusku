    "overview": "Togenashi Togeari's memorable 1st ONE-MAN LIVE \"Twilight Prelude\" held at 1000 CLUB in Yokohama on Saturday, March 16, 2024.  This live was held before the TV anime \"Girls Band Cry\" started broadcasting, but the venue, which can accommodate about 1,000 people, was filled by fans who had heard of the band early on. It was Togenashi Togeari's first one-man live. Their overwhelming performance already foreshadowed their musical potential and a great leap forward to date."
