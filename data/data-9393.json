In a bid to get rid of Jack, the producer spikes his drink with a drug at a glamorous function, and before long Jack has got himself on the wrong side of the law.  While on the run, Jack turns to his friend, a make-up artist, who turns him into \"Mama Bolo\". Mama Bolo soon finds “herself” employed by the producer’s fiancée, Angela.
