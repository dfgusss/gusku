Accompanied by a television crew, three women with so-called visionary mystical gifts are sent to the mountains as contestants on a survival reality show. In the loneliness of abandoned landscapes, they will have to find a televised prophetic revelation with the goal of finding a new Spirit Age in primetime. The three women will be judged in a televised media trial, where the bishop will question the protagonists about their visions related to the desire, the truth and the price of eternal salvation."
