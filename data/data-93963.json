    "overview": "\"Something to Call Our Own\" is a compelling documentary that delves into the origins, obstacles, and evolution of modern CHamoru dance. From the small island of Guam to the international stage of FestPAC, the documentary showcases the inspiring story of cultural revival, resilience, and the ongoing journey to reclaim and preserve a tradition that belongs to the CHamoru people.  Once silenced by colonization, the CHamoru people rise—through song, chant, and dance. At the heart of this revival stands Master Frank Rabon, who dared to reimagine a lost tradition, giving it back to the generations who longed for it. From the shores of Guam to the world stage of FestPAC the CHamoru people reclaim their identity, their language, their pride. Through every movement, there’s a dance and with every dance they declare: We are still here and this is Something to Call Our Own."
