    "overview": "At her christening, Princess Aurora is granted all perfections and qualities by her godmothers. The old Fairy Carabosse, who was forgotten as guest to the festivities, casts a terrible spell: Aurore will prick her finger with a spindle and die. Fortunately, the Lilac Fairy lessens the curse. Instead of dying, the Princess will fall into a long, deep sleep that will last a hundred years."
