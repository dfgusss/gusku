    "overview": "The once most magnificent imperial city in China is located in what is now Fengyang. The first city of the Ming dynasty was a model for all those who followed - including Beijing. After around 600 years underground, the ruined city is now being excavated again. Archaeologists, researchers, historians and workers are following in the footsteps of a bygone era and gaining new insights into the fate of a mysterious city every day."
