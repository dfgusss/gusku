    "overview": "Learning to Walk 2 offers a portrait of the legendary animator Borivoj Dovniković Bordo through a long period of the artist's life, witnessing challenging social and political upheavals, focusing on those moments in which the artist himself becomes, in a way, his own main character. Through a combination of Bordo's animated works, comics and caricatures, this film seeks to speak about the freedom of creativity and seeks an answer to the eternal question: is there a systematic environment in which we truly and truly walk or do we walk lamely, as Bordo's universal hero does."
