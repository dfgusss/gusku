    "overview": "The year is 1988. Paranormal investigators Mick Sutherland and Archie Charlesworth have built their careers on confronting the unexplained across Northern Europe. But when a desperate call draws them to the isolated home of Elizabeth Blair, they encounter a presence unlike anything they’ve faced before.  Over seven days, this force begins to unravel their sanity, twisting their perception of reality and threatening to destroy their bond. This is no ordinary haunting. This is Case 13."
