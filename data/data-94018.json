    "overview": "For years, two couples have shared the perfect holiday home in the Alps and enjoyed each other’s company every summer. But when their teenage daughters are involved in a shocking accident, their long-standing friendship is put to a new, unthinkable test. As each couple works to uncover the truth and save their own daughter, long buried tensions and uncomfortable truths erupt, forcing them to abandon any pretense of decency and to question all of their certainties as spouses, parents and friends. When it comes to saving your child, is there any line you wouldn’t cross, or is it true that anything goes?"
