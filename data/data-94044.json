    "overview": "Just before her departure, Rita Lee writes a farewell letter to her three children and her husband and musical partner, Roberto de Carvalho, in which she reflects on her life and joyfully celebrates her family. Her final moments also mark the time to look back and review a career full of unforgettable successes, which led her to sell more than 55 million records. But it is also a time to reveal her downfalls, her vulnerable side, and her excesses as the queen of rock. With completely unseen personal archives and exclusive testimonies from her own family, as well as producers, journalists, musicians, and celebrities such as Gilberto Gil and Ney Matogrosso, \"Rita Lee: Mania de Você\" presents her definitive legacy."
