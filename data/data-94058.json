    "overview": "Dani's mom may be ready to exploit her daughter for personal gain, but Dani's not having any of it. She's Dani the Destroyer, the youngest and greatest magician of all time. And she's about to take the stage. This yucky horror fable demonstrates how devastating the consequences of underestimating someone can be. In spite of being ignored and belittled by every adult in her life, Dani knows who she is and what she wants to do. Her talents and dreams are stronger than anyone is anticipating. She has a voice and she's learning how to use it. And so is the rest of gen alpha; we all need to listen up."
