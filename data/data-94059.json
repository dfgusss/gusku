    "overview": "The film centres on Taro, an aimless indie filmmaker who gets convinced by Yuki, his girlfriend and financial sponsor, to attend a film festival in Beppu. There he meets the bubbly drifter actress Miki. Part travelogue, part self-reflexive comedy, the dynamic that follows this encounter delivers an ironic and realistic spin on Before Sunrise (1995), depicting two souls wandering around in search of life’s meaning."
