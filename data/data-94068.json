    "overview": "Putri had always known her mother, Sari, only as a talented tarot reader trusted by many high-ranking officials and prominent businessmen. She had almost no personal memories of her. That was until Sari died in an accident. One day, Putri received a text message on her phone-from her late mother's number. At first, she thought it was just a prank. But gradually, the messages began to give guidance about the future-events that actually came true. Putri slowly realized the messages were truly from her mother."
