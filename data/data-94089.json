    "overview": "Anne—seated in an obstetrics and gynecology clinic—grapples with a heart-wrenching dilemma: whether to terminate her unexpected pregnancy to pursue a high-paying job in the United States or stay in Taiwan and embrace life as a single mother. As the conflict between her rationality and emotions intensifies, her deep-seated fear of family life emerges like an unfathomable monster from within, threatening to consume her entirely."
