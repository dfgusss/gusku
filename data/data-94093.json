    "overview": "Himuro (Yasukaze Motomiya) and Tamura (Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi) returned to Tokyo to confront Okada (Yuki Matsumura). However, waiting for them was a notice of succession from the Hasekai, which was supposed to be under the Kyowakai's control. Upon learning that Okada’s faction had ties to the Hasekai's new successor, Himuro immediately severed ties, bringing the direct showdown between the Kyowakai and Marugami-kai closer.  Meanwhile, Reiko (Reira Arai), who had been hiding with Genji (Kuroishi Takahiro), continued living in hiding, harboring distrust towards Genji and others. Despite this, she remained focused on her vengeance against the Kyowakai. While Himuro and the others tried to clear up Reiko's misunderstanding for Minami (Rin Asuka), Reiko refused to listen. Gradually, she became more involved with Okada’s faction, who were willing to use anything for the war against the Kyowakai."
