    "overview": "In 2012, while filming at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris, Sophie Brudieu met Mahmoud, a victim of the Egyptian revolution. Blinded by facial injuries, he had been brought to France for treatment with help from a humanitarian organization. Brudieu filmed him for several months—until one day, he vanished. His sudden absence unfolds into a quiet search for a missing life. Blending observational footage, voice messages, and an intimate gaze, Light of my Eyes explores what it means to see through another's eyes and reflects on memory, otherness, and the possibility of solidarity within absence."
