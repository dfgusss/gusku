    "overview": "Júlia arrived some time ago in Glasgow fleeing from Barcelona; she wanted to start from scratch. Years have passed and she seems stuck: in the mornings she tries to pursue her career as a photographer, at night she cleans dishes in a restaurant. One afternoon, while taking portraits of pedestrians crossing a bridge, one of her eyes begins to fail. As illness begins to spread Júlia will begin a search into the past to the depths of Glasgow and its history. The river will carry her towards a memory: the day she met a mysterious group of men who pulled objects from the depths of the water and among them a strange Indian boy, Shubham, who also came to the city from far away in search of a new life."
