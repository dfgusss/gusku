As a journalist probes her for the truth, Rena recounts her forced marriage to the cult’s abusive leader Ervil LeBaron, and her journey through manipulation, violence, and survival. With the weight of her past threatening to consume her new life, she is forced to face her role in the cult’s crimes and must decide whether to expose the truth or retreat into silence."
