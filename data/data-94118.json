Peter spends the seven days summing up the results of his life which he considers worthless, in which he could not start a family, earn money, save his reputation. But time and again the events in which he becomes involved and which are filled with smiles, sadness, human destinies, let the viewer realize that the protagonist’s life is far from worthless."
