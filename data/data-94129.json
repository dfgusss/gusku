    "overview": "Noetic, Faun and Boléro: Three elements, three visions, three journeys through dance. Choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui's show offers a profound reflection on our intimate connection with the world around us. From putting mathematics in movement to Ravel's Boléro as a dance of death, Cherkaoui transcends the boundaries of the stage to offer us a unique philosophical perception of the world."
