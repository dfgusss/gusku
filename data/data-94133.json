    "overview": "Green Day’s headlining performance at Coachella 2025 on April 12, 2025 was a high-energy spectacle that blended their punk rock roots with bold political statements. The band delivered an 18-song set featuring classics like “American Idiot,” “Jesus of Suburbia,” and “Holiday,” while also incorporating new material and unexpected covers. Frontman Billie Joe Armstrong used the opportunity to modify lyrics, expressing criticism of current American President Donald Trump, voicing support for Palestinian rights, and referencing the suffering in Gaza."
