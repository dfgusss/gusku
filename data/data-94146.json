    "overview": "Bernadette Soubirous, just 14 years old, goes by the river near the Massabielle cave. It is there that, for the first time, a “lady dressed in white” appears to her. Accused of lying, Bernadette’s revelation initially provokes mistrust and tensions in her family, drawing the wrath of civil and ecclesiastical authorities. The rumor spreads. Pilgrims begin to converge. Lourdes goes down in History."
