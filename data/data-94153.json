    "overview": "The film does not have a main character, but instead explores the experience of war through the prism of the collective and the individual: those forced to flee, those who take up arms, those who lose their homes or are left to live among the ruins. The film shows people's reactions to aggression and violence, to the change in the space in which they live, and their adaptation to a new reality."
