    "overview": "Two decades into their career, with six records since their formation in 2005, 300M+ streams, four consecutive number #1 albums, and the strongest line-up the Finnish power/symphonic metal group ever had, it’s about time Battle Beast  release a proper live release captured in January 2023 at the sold-out Helsinki Ice Hall showing that the sextet is at the top of their game right now! “Circus Of Doom – Live in Helsinki 2023” is a triumphant display of entertaining and monumental heavy rock. Live recording from Helsinki Ice Hall, Finland, on the 27th of January 2023."
