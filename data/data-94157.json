    "overview": "A spectre is haunting the city - a spectre of a cryptic ghost. In the liminal, neglected areas of Ljubljana, lurks the spectre of a striped hyena - a ghost of an animal that fled from the travelling menagerie in 1898. After her escape she managed to lurk around the periphery of the city for several months, scaring and confusing the locals with her presence. In the end, she was shot in the Rasica forest and transformed into an exhibit at the Natural History Museum of Slovenia. Now she stands there, frozen in an awkward pose, small fragile body and glass eyes full of fear with a large bloody bone placed in her mouth by the taxidermist to enhance the animal's perceived ferocity."
