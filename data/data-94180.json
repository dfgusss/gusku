    "overview": "In 2024, the eleven (!) members of the iconic mid-90’s cult comedy troupe The State reunited for a live tour. With their irreverent and absurdist live sketches as the backdrop, and framed with a greatest-hits playlist of classic material, the group’s unreasonably talented stars sit down to share the behind-the-scenes story of The State’s meteoric rise and lasting influence- in typically hilarious fashion."
