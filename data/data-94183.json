    "overview": "Brishti, still grieving her husband Neel's death, finds herself at odds with her sister-in-law Swapna, who is convinced their home is cursed. As Neel's death anniversary approaches, Swapna becomes obsessed with rituals to cleanse the house of dark forces, while Brishti dismisses her fears. But when eerie incidents escalate and Brishti's behaviour turns unsettling, the presence of a malevolent Pishach seems undeniable."
