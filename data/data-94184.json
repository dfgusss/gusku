    "overview": "Once, the Chakrabortys of Manikpur were a thriving family of 34, united in laughter, meals, and the grand celebration of Raas. In the 90s, Rajat left for Kolkata to chase his ambitions, leaving behind his wife Annapurna and son Somnath. Raised among his cousins, Somnath grew closer to his grandmother than his mother. When he was twelve, Annapurna succumbed to a terminal illness. Rajat, unaware until his return, was consumed by anger and left Manikpur with his son, vowing never to return."
