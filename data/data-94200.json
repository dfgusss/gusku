    "overview": "Takuya and Mamoru are two young men from disadvantaged backgrounds who've been sucked into Japan's criminal underworld. Their job involves posing as women on social media to exploit isolated men and sell their personal identities. When they're not working, they're just ordinary friends who like hanging out together and sometimes letting loose. But when Takuya turns to Kajitani—a big brother figure who introduced him to the world of underground crime—to help him and Mamoru escape, they discover it isn't so simple."
