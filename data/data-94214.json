    "overview": "“A State for one man is no State at all” are the words from Sophocles’ Antigone. Sara has lost her brother to Covid–19. She wants nothing more than to say goodbye to her brother with a traditional burial that respects the Cape Verdean culture and grave site. In a world silenced and halted by the pandemic, the young woman connects with her community and memories."
