    "overview": "Tony Dandridge is caught and exposed as a serial killer and is killed by the police. His wife Katherine claims that she knew nothing about her husband’s horrors, but the community and the press don’t believe it and torment her. Her very unlikely supporter is Doreen, the mother of the only victim of Dandridge’s to survive. It becomes a cat and mouse game as it appears possible that Katherine or Doreen may be lying or is it both of them?"
