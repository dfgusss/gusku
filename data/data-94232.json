    "overview": "When a disillusioned, queer hitman accepts a contract with no clear target, he stumbles into a surreal spiral of mistaken identities, chaotic murders, and bizarre detours—including an impromptu drag show, a karaoke shootout, and a deeply symbolic banana. As the bodies pile up and reality begins to fray, he's forced to confront the fragmented parts of himself—gender, guilt, memory, and purpose—all while dodging corrupt cops, philosophical assassins, and a cult that worships breakfast fruit. 7 Kills, 3 Songs & a Banana blends gritty crime with absurdist comedy and raw LGBT+ themes, delivering a wild ride that’s equal parts Tarantino, Lynch, and queer theatre. With every song and kill, the line between performance and truth blurs. Is this redemption, revenge, or just another bloody joke? One thing’s certain: you’ve never seen a banana used like this before."
