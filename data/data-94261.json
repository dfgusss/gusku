    "overview": "Marga, a widow trapped in monotony, is surprised when her granddaughter sets her up on a date through an app, pretending to be her. Despite her initial resistance, Marga meets Agapito, a talkative man who loves salsa, but the night does not go as she expected, since at a certain age relationships have their own rhythm."
