    "overview": "What happens when Watanabe meets horror? The eccentric director of instant cult movie \"Techno Brothers\" plays a director hired by a production company to make a documentary. His task is to spend a week in a haunted house. The approach is comical and offbeat, but as the story progresses, the laughter gives way to fear. Will we end up more scared or amused?"
