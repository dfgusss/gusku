    "overview": "Seo-yeon and Dong-seok had been trying to make their marriage work, but constant arguments and unresolved issues were driving them apart. One day, after a nudge from their friend Na-sung, they decided to give a dating app a try. Hoping to find some clarity or escape from their frustrations, they started meeting other people. Seo-yeon with other men, and Dong-seok with other women. What began as an attempt to fix their problems only seemed to push them further away from each other."
