Antek blames Paula for their mother leaving them - and their strained relationship goes from bad to worse when Paula invites her friends over for a party. The night takes a dark turn after the unexpected and unpleasant visit of a schoolmate. What was meant to be a carefree weekend quickly descends into terror, as the supposedly secure house becomes a deadly trap."
