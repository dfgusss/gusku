    "overview": "This is the story  about Kumud Pant. He was seriously ill — intense pain, struggling to breathe. He was rushed to Frimley Park Hospital, where doctors discovered two gallstones, each 13 millimeters, lodged dangerously. Emergency surgery was the only option. His gallbladder was removed, and though the operation was successful, complications followed. For three days, he stayed on oxygen, fighting not just for breath but for life itself. On the fourth day, something changed. He stood up. He walked. Against the odds, he was discharged. Now, he says it clearly. His stones are gone… but his life goes on. Stone gone. Life on."
