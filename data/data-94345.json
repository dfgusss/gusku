    "overview": "He has never been more successful than he is today: in 2024, Roland Kaiser broke all audience records on his sold-out anniversary tour, was awarded his third Golden Hen, honored with four stamps of his own, and immortalized as a wax figure. And in 2025, the charismatic singer and entertainer is once again in top creative form—among other things, with the release of his new LP “Marathon.” In 2025, Kaiser will also be seen on the big screen for the first time."
