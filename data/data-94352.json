    "overview": "To mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, Wim Wenders shot a short film that takes us to the most secret place in Europe at that time: a map room in a school in Reims, France, which served as a war room for the Allies. On May 7, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered there and the world war ended."
