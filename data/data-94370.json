    "overview": "Shane and Gaila -- both bearing the baggage of being heartbroken -- decide to be each other's \"in between\" while they look for love in other places.  Gaila and Shane become each other’s “in-between” – a comfortable, non-committal relationship they find convenient before settling down with “The One”. They initially meet and disagree, but develop a strong connection, helping each other in various aspects of life, like work, love, and social circles. However, their comfortable relationship blossoms into something deeper, but their happiness is disrupted by the return of Shane’s past love."
