    "overview": "Jean-Luc le Tenia (1975-2011) is the author of more than 1,300 songs, produced in a hurry, minimalist and melancholic. Becoming a true legend during his lifetime in Le Mans, the singer is considered the French Daniel Johnston. From his complex relationships with others, particularly with women, and from his deep psychological suffering, he created songs that many still sing. In this film, enriched by archives and interviews with those who knew him, historian Hervé Guillemain reconstructs the influences, practices and singular journey of a multifaceted artist by placing him in the history of French song and the alternative punk movement, in the landscapes of the city of Le Mans. Between art, psychology and history, Alors je fais des chansons is a film which, by observing the creative process on an individual level, ultimately questions the notion of art brut."
