    "overview": "A small detachment of the 12th Armored Division is sent to rescue French political prisoners near the end of WWII. The soldiers take an instant dislike to the elite French who are equally unimpressed with the small rag-tag force sent to save them. But as SS troops surround the castle, the soldiers and prisoners will have to fight together if they have any chance of surviving the onslaught of the Elite SS soldiers."
