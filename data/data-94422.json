Sunhee’s behavior becomes completely different, and in that moment of drastic change, Yujeong finds herself drawn into a dangerous trap. Meanwhile, Yujeong’s close friend and brother figure Gangsu, who distrusts people, senses something is wrong. As the dark side of Sunhee’s personality reveals itself, the relationships between the three become increasingly tense—and only the truth, twisted and buried, can resolve the chao."
