    "overview": "Two brothers. One unforgiving desert. No way back. In The Toughest Footrace on Earth, Average Rob and Arno The Kid enter the Moroccan desert for the Marathon Des Sables Legendary — an impulsive decision that turns into a relentless battle against the heat, injuries and themselves. What follows is a physical and mental ordeal without filters or excuses. After six months of intensive preparation, Rob & Arno are at the start of a nearly impossible adventure: a gruelling 250-kilometre walk through the scorching Sahara desert, braving sandstorms, unbearable heat and complete exhaustion. From the first training to the last step across the finish line, you get an unfiltered view of the brothers' unparalleled journey. Along the way, they meet inspiring individuals, all of whom, based on their own personal motivation, take on the battle with themselves on the hottest stage in the world."
