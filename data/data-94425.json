    "overview": "50 Years of Hits. One unforgettable story. Cold Chisel: The Big Five-O Live celebrates five decades of anthems that defined Australian music, from Khe Sanh to Standing On The Outside and Flame Trees. Recorded at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in November 2024 during their massive 50th anniversary tour, this film captures Cold Chisel in peak form - raw, loud, emotional, and still unmatched on stage. High-voltage performances, amplified by a crowd singing every word.  Following its broadcast premiere on Channel 7, the double-disc DVD brings the full Cold Chisel concert experience home – with 10 additional songs and over an hour of additional interviews."
