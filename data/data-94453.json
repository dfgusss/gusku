Michelle, Jacky, and Gthan are film students struggling to break into the industry, so they decide to start their own channel, \"No Depth of Field\"! The channel features two charismatic KOLs: Yannis and Sugar. By chance, Yannis guest-stars on a famous large-scale channel, \"Stack Upon Stack,\" boosting their video click rates. Just as they think their channel is finally taking off, Yannis grows suspiciously close to \"Stack Upon Stack's\" mastermind, Kuang哥... It turns out Yannis is secretly planning to jump ship to \"Stack Upon Stack\" and team up with their star, Kimchi! The team tries every trick in the book to keep Yannis, but birds choose the best trees to perch on, and Yannis ultimately leaves. To fill the gap, they tirelessly scout for new talent with viral potential and unexpectedly discover the quirky, unique Anna. Together, the five of them venture into the boundless world of the internet!"
