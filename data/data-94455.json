    "overview": "Behind the Ancient God's Land, the Eternal Night Demon City in the Demon Cultivation Sea rises overnight. In order to expand its territory, it attacks the sects around the Sea, including the Yuntian Sect. Li Muwan is poisoned in the battle to protect the gate, leaving her life at stake. After Wang Lin learns of this, he takes her into the Sea again. Wang Lin fights the three city lords with his initial cultivation of the God of Incarnation, and becomes famous in the Sea. He returns with the antidote to save Li Muwan, but finds that the crisis unresolved, and the thousand-year conspiracy surfaces. Relying on their feelings and the first fusion with the body of the Ancient God after the God of Incarnation, Li Muwan and Wang Lin join forces to defeat the Demon Lord."
