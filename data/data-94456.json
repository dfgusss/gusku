Her husband, Igor, watches Diana's progress with concern and tries to make her understand the importance of dealing with the disease and making changes in her life. Terrified, feeling guilty and unable to accept her new reality, she ignores all the hands reaching out to help her and makes a superhuman effort to remain independent."
