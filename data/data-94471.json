    "overview": "In this new hour, Warren goes on the offensive, taking down poison ivy, snakes, and pretty much the entire great outdoors. He also blows the whistle on the chaos of late-night customer service at his favorite retailers. With the veteran storytelling skills of a seasoned comic—and former collegiate wrestler—Greg revisits the coach who’s been living rent-free in his head for over 30 years. Yes, high school fishing teams are real. So are their cheerleaders. And with a routine you won’t forget, The Champ sticks the landing and scores big laughs."
