    "overview": "In the heart of Watts, a beloved neighborhood legend named Maxwell seeks redemption as a father after a lifetime of using basketball to mask his pain. Once a symbol of hope for his community, Maxwell now faces the quiet collapse of his past glory, haunted by memories that blur triumph with trauma. As the neighborhood around him changes and his eldest son unexpectedly moves in, Maxwell is forced to confront the man he's become and the father he wants to be. Guided by the same community that once cheered him on, GOOD SHOT is an affecting portrait of a man learning that showing up, even imperfectly, can be its own kind of victory."
