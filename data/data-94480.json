    "overview": "In a besieged town, con artist Jia Yizheng poses as a government envoy to swindle Hu Dingbang, a local defense force commander. On the run, Jia is mistaken by Mayor Xie Qianli—a secret collaborator with Japanese forces—for the real envoy. Exploiting each other, they engage in a cutthroat power play, creating chaotic farce. Amidst absurd conflicts, Jia eventually abandons deceit to join the anti-Japanese resistance."
