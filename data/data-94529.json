    "overview": "It’s 2025, and let’s just say—things are not going great out there. Organized crime rules the streets, drugs and corruption are everywhere. You can’t even grab an ice cream cone without bumping into gangsters. Like the song says, we need a hero. Good news—he’s about to show up. An unexpected vigilante, back from the dead to take out the trash! Prophet the mobster and his gang better watch their backs."
