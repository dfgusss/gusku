    "overview": "Abdullah Gaza or usually called Gaza is an orphan boy. His father, a humanitarian volunteer, died after returning from Palestine. Since his father's death, Gaza has been placed in an orphanage managed by Ustazah Dewi and his sister Rafah Shafira. There, Gaza met Hayya, a little girl from Palestine who had lived for four years and was trying to find peace in this country. The genocide in Palestine prevented Hayya from returning to his homeland. At the orphanage, Gaza and Hayya's relationship gradually became close. For Hayya, the presence of Gaza is like a cure for longing, considering that its name is similar to the land of his birth. Their lives became cheerful again, complementing each other, until a bad incident came back and threatened their lives."
