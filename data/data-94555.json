    "overview": "Many people want their five minutes of fame but for some, it comes at the ultimate price - their life!' Meet John Abbott, narcissistic host of infamous real-crime show Lights, Camera, KILL. Known for its lurid re-enactments of the darkest of trespasses, it has made him rich by exploiting pain and suffering. Yet while Abbott basks shamelessly in the limelight, one victim has seen enough. Broken by his loss, the man has a burning thirst for revenge - and now he wants to make Abbott bleed."
