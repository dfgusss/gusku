    "overview": "Malvina, a once celebrated ballerina now in her mid-eighties, now languishes in a monotonous routine. After she unexpectedly meets Kipras, a talented painter of her age, he becomes the catalyst for change. Together, they defy society's expectations about seniors, transcending age and challenging taboos. As they escape from relatives and institutions, they discover that freedom isn't merely physical; it's about breaking free from invisible chains. Their journey unfolds as a pas de deux – a dance of resilience, rebellion and redemption."
