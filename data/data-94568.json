    "overview": "Nikola, 34, is a commercial director, he’s about to become a father for the first time, and he dreams of one day taking his young family on a road trip in an old van he wants to convert into a camper. Over the course of one weekend, however, accompanying his father and extended family to a small village in Dalmatia, where his grandmother’s remains are to be buried, he finds himself looking to the past instead of the future. Ostensibly, nothing remarkable happens during the course of the journey."
