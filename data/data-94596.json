    "overview": "Since October 2024, four young men — Pedro Ignacio, Carlos Henrique, Leonardo Ghidini, and Muriel Funari — have been on the run, accused of various cybercrimes. Known as the infamous \"Julita Pintuda\" group, they’ve become modern urban legends, fueled by jokes, theories, and a mix of fascination and disgust.  This documentary dives, for the first time, into the bizarre and unlikely depths of the case. Interviews with victims, witnesses, and enigmatic figures reveal a web of obsession, digital stalking, and vigilante justice. Leaked audio files, old profiles, police operations, and a mysterious cabin in the snow paint a chilling portrait — as disturbing as it is hypnotic."
