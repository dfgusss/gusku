    "overview": "A documentary that records the lives of a group of former (and some still active) Portuguese transvestites. They are: Zizi Mayer, Fanny Star, Guida Scarllaty, Deborah Krystal and Wanda Morelli. They are João Callati, Fernando Paulo, Carlos Ferreira, Fernando Santos and Fernando Soares. All these artists deserve to have their lives told because they are bigger than anything they give on stage. They are important symbols of Portuguese cultural memory and their lives and careers illustrate different moments and mentalities in our country. They are lives that have endured hardships and overcome them in forbidding times and where persecution and punishment reigned supreme. No documentary has ever been made about their lives and it is urgent that these stories are not lost. They also tell the story of our political and cultural country."
