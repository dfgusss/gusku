    "overview": "Anti-narcotics officer Kang Miao is on the trail of a notorious drug lord known as “Old Kite”—only to discover he is none other than his long-lost brother, Lei Ting! A 12-year-old grudge resurfaces: Lei Ting had been forced into working for the drug cartel in order to save Feng Ling. As their cat-and-mouse game intensifies, the two brothers find themselves pointing guns at each other. When justice collides with family ties, Lei Ting sacrifices himself for redemption, while Kang Miao holds firm to his beliefs, vowing to dismantle the drug network. A gripping tale of moral struggle and the clash between good and evil—on the path to eradicating drugs, every step is paved with blood and tears."
