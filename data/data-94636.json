    "overview": "Lithium is the essential element for the batteries of our electric vehicles and for our energy storage. Europe has enough lithium in its bedrock to become self-sufficient. But today there is no operational mine yet, and the EU is depending on imports from China. A new responsible way of mining is necessary, one that recognizes the importance of local and cultural preservation. Can the European Union lead the way?"
