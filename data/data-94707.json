    "overview": "Beethoven was a musician who overcame an incurable deafness disease and left behind many masterpieces. However, in reality, he was a vulgar and dirty old man. This film depicts the story of Schindler, the secretary who \"fabricated\" the sublime image of Beethoven that is conveyed to the public. Driven by a sense of mission to absolutely protect Beethoven, who saved him from rock bottom, Schindler changes Beethoven's image after his death from a \"vulgar and dirty old man\" to a \"sacred and genius musician.\""
