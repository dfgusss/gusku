With only three days left until the deadline, she asks for the help of the company's top employee, Miguel. Miguel has a crush on Leya so it is easy for her to trick him into doing all the tasks for the project by himself. Will Leya get the credit for all of Miguel's hard work or will she have a change of heart?"
