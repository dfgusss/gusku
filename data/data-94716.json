    "overview": "After being steeped in Chinese traditional culture for 30 years, CHEN went to Paris in 1984. The different cultural environments of China and France enabled him to grow into a unique figure in the field of classical music. CHEN neither seeks approval from the West, not even his advisor Olivier Messiaen, nor caters to China. Instead, he uses his personal musical language to tell Eastern stories."
