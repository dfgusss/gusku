    "overview": "Rick Owens' Spring/Summer 2026 menswear collection, titled Temple, was a theatrical exploration of legacy, transformation, and raw sensuality. Staged at Paris' Palais de Tokyo, the show featured models descending a towering scaffold into a fountain, immersing themselves in water before ascending again—symbolizing rebirth and resilience. The collection showcased Owens' signature elements: slashed Tuscan leathers, studded straps, voluminous flight jackets, and towering platform boots, all rendered in a monochrome palette. This presentation coincided with his Temple of Love retrospective at the Palais Galliera, offering a poignant reflection on his career and the enduring themes of love and mortality."
