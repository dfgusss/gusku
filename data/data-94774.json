Tired of being the backbone of the family because Jati is reluctant to look for work, Melati is determined to divorce her husband. However, on the eve of Eid, the request of Melati's mother, who suffers from dementia, to celebrate Eid together postponed their divorce. Will they get back together or is separation inevitable?"
