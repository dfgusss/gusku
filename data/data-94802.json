    "overview": "How do you deal with it when a loved one suddenly decides against you and can no longer be reached. Rosa spends her summer in her former boyfriend's street, on the wall opposite his house, to get the apology she thinks she deserves and is supported in this endeavour by the residents of the street. One day it turns out that her ex-boyfriend has gone on holiday and Rosa is encouraged to do the same. A journey begins with the obsessive attempt to have a good time and the question of how to say goodbye to someone who is suddenly no longer there."
