    "overview": "Gladys, a woman in her fifties, lives on the fringes of society, without a home, without a health insurance card, without a bank. Nothing matters to her, not even sex, alcohol, or dancing, which she practices with a joyful frenzy. One morning, she meets Eugénie, a friend from high school, by chance. Eugénie tries to help her against her will."
