    "overview": "The Queen of the Hills is a reconstruction of a film shot and edited in 1988-89 but never completed. It was made as a companion piece to the MacDougalls’ film Photo Wallahs (1991), a study of photography and photographers in the north Indian hill station of Mussoorie. The film is a portrait of the hill station and its inhabitants, focusing on its unusual colonial past and postcolonial present. It has been restored digitally from the faded and damaged 16mm workprint produced in the 1980s."
