Along the way we follow some of the participants home providing  an intimate glimpse into their private lives. With music by Lady Gaga, Billy Joel, Lionel Ritchie, The Hollies, The Righteous Brothers and more, this film will strip away any preconceptions you ever had about people with disabilities."
