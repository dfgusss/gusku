    "overview": "In the anonymity of an increasingly automated city, a successful but socially  struggling man finds an unexpected emotional connection through a help desk conversation. Thank You for Calling (Met Wie Spreek Ik) is a short, magical-realistic film about Rens, a director of a music venue who is on the brink of a burn-out. After an emotional breakdown, he is unexpectedly called by Herman, an unknown man on a houseboat. What starts as an uncomfortable phone call, ends in an absurd musical journey."
