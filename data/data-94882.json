    "overview": "In the early '90s, Portuguese nanny Leonor accompanies 8-year-old Vera to France, where Vera spends her vacation with her estranged French father and his new family. The deep bond between Leonor and Vera, along with the language barrier isolating them, creates a complex dynamic. As tensions mount, Leonor faces reminders of her subordinate position within the household."
