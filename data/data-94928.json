    "overview": "In 2025, anti-Semitism is more widespread in Germany than at any time since the end of the Holocaust. Since October 7, 2023, the attack on Israel by Palestinian terrorists led by Hamas, the number of anti-Semitic crimes in Germany has doubled, and violence is increasing. This documentary follows Jews and asks how they are dealing with the rise of anti-Semitism. Three survivors of Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp speak out, expressing their horror at the resurgence of anti-Semitism 80 years later. Likewise, survivors of the most recent massacre are receiving a voice, such as Tal Shamony, who studies in Berlin, and experiencing only hostility instead of support. Jewish student Lahav Shapira, whose grandfathers died during both the Holocaust and the 1972 Munich Olympic massacre, was brutally beaten by pro-Palestinian activists at the Free University of Berlin, a hotbed of anti-Semitism, simply because he advocated for the release of Israeli hostages. Yet politicians remain inactive."
