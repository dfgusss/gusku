    "overview": "An elderly actress arrives at her holiday home in Bretagne to prepare for a new film. She brings with her numerous scrapbooks and countless film memorabilia. With a personal oeuvre of more than fifty films, the past and present sometimes intertwine. Images of the woman in her beach house mirror images from her films, and images from films intertwine with events from her own life. When a young cyclist breaks down near the house, he challenges the actress to dig deeper into her past. They spend a compact day together. Every question, every image, every article triggers a memory for the woman."
