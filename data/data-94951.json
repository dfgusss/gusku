    "overview": "There’s a Naples of the imagination and there’s the real city: the city of fiction and the one with its tales of a past very much alive. Massimilano Gallo’s directorial debut, La salita, is a film about a little-known anecdote from the life of Eduardo De Filippo, featuring a Nisida very different from the image it has in the series Mare fuori, yet Gallo’s take on prison and women behind bars is just as contemporary.
