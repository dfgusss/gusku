    "overview": "A visual story that captures the essence of the Giffoni Film Festival, described by François Truffaut as “the most necessary of festivals.” It is not a simple documentary, but an emotional diary that mixes daily observations with creative narration. It is an intimate and collective look at Giffoni, a place that every summer is transformed into a small cinema town, inhabited by real emotions and personal visions. A tribute to cinema as a tool for growth and to a festival that manages to give a voice to those who, through cinema, seek to better understand themselves and the world."
