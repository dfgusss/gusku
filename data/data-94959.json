    "overview": "1992, Boyle Heights, Daisy, a twelve-year-old kids' show host, and her sister Mimi are interrogated by a local police officer. Maria-Luisa, Mimi's best friend, has gone missing, and the last time she was seen was at their traditional Sunday barbecue. Shaken, it doesn't seem like Daisy is able to share any piece of information useful for the investigation. However, a few days later, as Daisy visits Maria-Luisa's altar and recalls the events of that day, we soon realize that reality might not be what it seems."
