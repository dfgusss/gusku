Ordinary situations cannot seriously influence the course of the global world conflict, which unfolded on thousands of kilometers of the front of a vast country, in which tens of millions of soldiers are participating. But it was the human qualities of everyone who stood to the death with weapons in their hands in this harsh time, where all the forces of good and evil came together, and everyone was ready to do anything for the sake of victory, that became the force that crushed Nazism."
