    "overview": "A psychologist's longing for family puts a strain on his current relationship, a priest wrestles with his own desires after catching his peers in a moment of intimacy, and a husband has a heated exchange with his wife, while his new partner waits quietly in the bedroom. A tender collection of stories of men torn between two worlds, as the feelings they once buried come rushing back to the surface."
