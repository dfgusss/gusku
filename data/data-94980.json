He’s partying with celebrities, rubbing shoulders with famous athletes, and the world is at his fingertips. Then everything changes – he’s diagnosed with a debilitating illness and the spotlight gradually slips away. At the height of his anguish, he stumbles upon a broken statue of the Virgin Mary, and his life takes an unexpected turn. In this moment of spiritual awakening, Kevin finds his true purpose and calling, discovering what matters most. Calling himself “Mary’s Roadie,” he offers his fans something deeper: inspiration and hope."
