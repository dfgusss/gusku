    "overview": "Three young men, restless and consumed by unfulfilled desires, drift through Madrid forming a volatile and toxic friendship. Their resentment toward women grows into a shared language of anger, pushing them into a spiral of reckless acts, broken relationships, and self-destruction.\r As their lives begin to unravel, each of them is forced to confront the darkness they’ve nurtured — and to face the uncomfortable truth about who they are and what they fear becoming."
