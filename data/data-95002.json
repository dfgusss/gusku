    "overview": "Nora is about to turn 40 and can't stop wondering: what's the point of all this? What was meant to be a celebration turns into a series of unfortunate missteps that push her toward self-discovery. With open wounds, unspoken desires, and a burning past, Nora confronts her family history, death, unemployment, the collapse of her polyamorous relationship, and the urgent need to redefine love, her sexuality, and what she truly wants from life."
