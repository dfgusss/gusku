    "overview": "Yuji and Yuriko's peaceful life shatters when an old diary belonging to Yuji's great-uncle Sadaichi, who died in the war, is discovered. The pages are full of an obsession with life... and one strange phrase: \"I want to devour the bird—Hikuidori.\" From that day on, eerie phenomena start to haunt those connected to the diary. As the nightmare deepens, a strong will to live—once buried with Sadaichi—begins to twist the past and bleed into reality."
