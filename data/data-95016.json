As Gio rises through the ranks of Europe’s drug underworld, he becomes a key player in a brutal cycle of retaliation, trafficking, and betrayal that stretches from the streets of Amsterdam to the ports of Tangier. Meanwhile, prosecutors Sabine and Yorick uncover a vast encrypted communication network used by criminals to coordinate hits and drug shipments. When a crown witness comes forward and they start closing in on Gio, the lines between justice and vengeance blur."
