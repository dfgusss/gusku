    "overview": "A janitor with a loving wife and a devoted son leads a seemingly quiet, orderly life. One day, the boy asks his father an inconspicuous but profound question: “Dad, why are there no photos of you at my age?” Driven by a restlessness that can no longer be suppressed, the man returns to the place of his childhood: a children's home he has avoided for decades."
