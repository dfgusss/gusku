    "overview": "It tells the story of Roberto Parra Sandoval, creator of the cueca chora and chronicler of Buenos Aires' bohemian scene. A guide boy and stowaway on freight trains, he forges a life in the brothels and bars of Valparaíso and Santiago, bringing the music of the working-class neighborhoods to life. His world changes radically when he meets Negra Ester, a fascinating and contradictory woman who plunges him into a passionate and heartbreaking love. Together they will experience a story that beats to the rhythm of the cueca brava, amid laughter, hurt, and disappointment, in the heart of a marginal, luminous, and painful Chile."
