    "overview": "The Lucerne Festival Orchestra and its music director Riccardo Chailly dedicate an evening to Sergei Rachmaninoff, with Italian pianist Beatrice Rana shining in the highly virtuosic variations of the Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. Also on the programme is the mysterious Symphony No. 1 and The Rock, an early work that already gives a glimpse of the Russian composer's musical sensibility."
