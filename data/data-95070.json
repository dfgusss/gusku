    "overview": "The meeting of Maria and Fafat in a church on Christmas Eve, changed their fate. Maria did not expect that her relationship with Fafat would lead to an interfaith relationship. But the two of them had already fallen in love and decided to marry. When their daughter was born and not yet a year old, Fafat died in an accident. Maria was left alone, patiently raising her daughter Laila, according to the Islamic teachings that had been promised to her late husband. However, Ustadzah Habibah saw that Maria's efforts in educating Laila with Islamic teachings were still lacking, so she wanted to take and educate her granddaughter herself. After her husband, would Maria also lose her child?"
