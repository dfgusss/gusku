    "overview": "Risa Tanaka is a 30-something who is super sincere and hates lies, but after her mother dies and her boyfriend cheats on her, she takes up work with a human rental service. Despite reservations, she begins to play girlfriends, talent managers, and other roles for people across Tokyo who she is hired by. All the while, between experiences with her clients and life lessons from her laidback boss Teramura, her experiences begin to heal her heart while her wholsomeness rubs off on them."
