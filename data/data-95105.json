    "overview": "When horror icon Vlad Eterno shuffles off the mortal coil, it seems a monstrous voice in the fright community has been forever silenced. But Eterno leaves a final dark gift to an unsuspecting world – his final tales of death…by Unnatural Causes!  Thrill as Vlad personally walks us through creepy vignettes of stalked housewives, portals to other dimensions used for revenge, and a betrayed murder victim resurrected to claim justice and comeuppance upon his destroyers."
