    "overview": "A teacher, activist, and guardian of Amazonian knowledge, Dona Onete became a music star at 72, but her story began much earlier. In this documentary filmed among the rivers and forests of Pará, Onete sings of the banzeiros (drums), the dolphins, and the flavors of the forest with humor and wisdom in a celebration of the living Amazon that pulsates in her voice."
