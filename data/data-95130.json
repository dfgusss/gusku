    "overview": "Jate, a man scarred by a horrific past, lost his entire family to a Yai Pop, a cannibalistic spirit who not only slaughtered them but also left a dreadful curse upon him. Every time he encounters Phra Oom Ma (the Monk Carrying a Dog), he suffers unbearable agony, as if fate itself has condemned him to become the next heir of the demon spirit. Fueled by hatred, Jate hunts down and exterminates the ghoul village, nearly wiping them out, yet the curse refuses to fade and continues to haunt him every single day."
