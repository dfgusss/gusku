    "overview": "“My name is Xia Jinsheng. I trade in seafood. When I was 45, my son jumped to his death. On the 37th day after he died, I entered all of his online chat groups. I discovered that they were filled with young people struggling with depression, many contemplating suicide. I didn’t understand why. I left 19,000 messages, spoke to 127 boys and 49 girls — but I still haven’t found an answer.”  Through the words and investigation of a grieving father, the film explores the silent digital spaces where despair gathers and the fragile connections that remain between life and death. It is a haunting portrait of love, loss, and the desperate human search for understanding in the age of online isolation."
