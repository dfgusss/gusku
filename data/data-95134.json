    "overview": "Eszter, a sixth-grade girl, is trapped between constant bullying at school and the silence of a broken home. Her classmates mock her, her teacher, Irén Vácz, humiliates her, and her divorcing parents barely notice what she goes through. One desperate day, she climbs onto the school roof — and meets Magnus, a mischievous ghost. He’s lazy, cheeky, and annoying… yet their strange bond changes Eszter’s life forever."
