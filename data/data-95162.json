    "overview": "From the turmoil of the 1960s to the chaos of today, RFK: Legacy follows the father-son journey of two political insurgents who refused to play by the rules. Robert F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stood up to the establishment in pursuit of truth, justice, and accountability—at great personal cost. This powerful documentary is both a tribute and a warning: history doesn’t repeat itself—it echoes."
