    "overview": "In this documentary, director Nathalie Faber approaches the troubled relationship between humans and nature as a relationship crisis. Four people with different relationships to nature, in a unique setting, present their perspectives to psychiatrist and relationship therapist Dirk De Wachter.  The documentary explores how imagination can help us reassess nature and reconnect with it, because separation is not an option. Can we still overcome this relationship crisis?"
