    "overview": "Shintaro Yokota, at 18, fulfilled his childhood dream with a dazzling pro debut. Embraced by a loving family and his team, he had a bright career lay ahead—until something felt wrong with his vision. A medical examination delivered a diagnosis no young athlete should ever hear: a brain tumor. Driven by a single desire to play baseball and supported by those who never stopped believing in his comeback, he fought on until his final game, which saw a miracle no one had imagined. The true story of Yokota that continues to move and inspire us all."
