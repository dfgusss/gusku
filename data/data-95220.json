    "overview": "When Bella Fox’s dramatic exit from a hit dance competition show goes viral, her best friend Hannah whisks her away from the chaos to a cozy community ballroom studio in upstate New York. Bella expects peace and quiet—but instead finds herself intrigued by Will, the charming, down-to-earth property manager who’s secretly a gifted (if untrained) dancer. With a holiday showcase fast approaching, Bella and Will step into rehearsals and begin to rediscover their love for dance, life, and maybe each other. As Bella adjusts to life off-camera and faces a crossroads about her future, she learns that sometimes the right partner makes all the difference."
