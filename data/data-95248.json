Teaming up with Michael’s daughter, Daphne, and Mia’s son, Cruz (Lopez), the two families race across Buffalo in search of the season’s most sought-after toy – The Golden Gliders. Along the way, festive adventures, unexpected challenges and the spirit of the season draw Michael and Mia closer, proving the greatest gift is finding love and family when you least expect it."
