    "overview": "Chị Ngã Em Nâng is a touching story about two siblings, Thương and Lực, who grew up in a family devoted to the traditional craft of incense making. Tragedy struck early, leaving Thương as the sole support for her younger brother — taking on the roles of both sister and parent. Growing up with hardships, Thương relied on her resilience and the deep-rooted teachings of their parents to persevere and change their lives. She eventually found success and hoped her brother would follow the same path. However, her well-meaning imposition unintentionally created cracks in their bond, pushing the siblings into painful conflicts — even to the point of facing life and death."
