When a string of inexplicable deaths in Germany draws the Queen’s attention, Sebastian and Ciel are dispatched to uncover the truth. Their investigation leads them deep into the ominous “Forest of Werewolves,” a place rumored to kill anyone who dares to set foot within. But as they dig deeper into the mystery, a dreadful curse begins to take hold."
