    "overview": "At the center of this coming-of-age comedy is 19-year-old high school graduate Charlie, whose greatest dream is to become an actress. Standing at just 1.30 meters tall, she certainly stands out, but her height plays no role in her ambitions. She’s supported by her mother, Silke, who runs a small tailoring shop."
