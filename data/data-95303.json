    "overview": "Hava is having a myoma removed in a routine procedure. What was intended as a straightforward surgery turns into a nightmare: due to suspected malignant tissue, a complete hysterectomy is performed—a precautionary measure that forever alters Hava’s life. When she realizes the extent of the procedure, she feels stripped of her femininity and doesn’t know how to explain the irreversible damage to her boyfriend."
