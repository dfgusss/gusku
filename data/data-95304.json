    "overview": "Robin visits Ned in Vienna, only to discover that the larger-than-life friend he used to idolize has become more obnoxious and downright offensive over the years. A night on the town puts the two men's friendship to the test as Ned breaks more than a couple of rose-tinted spectacles."
