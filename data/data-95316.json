    "overview": "For acclaimed novelist Brian Johnson, the stage of his final book reading becomes an unexpected tribunal. The \"\"visitors,\"\"  who confront him are hauntingly familiar.\r Their question to Johnson: \"\"Have you truly been facing us all along?\"\" unlocks a flood of buried memories and regret as Johnson finally recognizes them as characters from his own novels.  This unsettling encounter awakens a part of himself he had nearly forgotten, compelling him to seek answers to the questions that define an author's soul: What is creation? To whom does a story belong? And what does it truly mean to write?"
