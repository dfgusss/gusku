    "overview": "A mortuary in Taiwan stores the bodies of deceased children whose parents, for whatever reason, have disappeared. Their remains are kept at the top of a freezer, sometimes for years, until the funeral home organizes a ceremony. Houses and horses made of paper are burned to accompany the children on their solitary journey to the afterlife."
