    "overview": "In a world where fear and trauma shape the birthing experience, Fear and Now redefines the narrative. After a far too common yet unacknowledged traumatic first birth, filmmaker Liat Ron discovers HypnoBirthing and embarks on a transformational journey, offering an unprecedented window into what birth can truly be. This trailblazing documentary reveals that safe, comfortable, enjoyable, and fear-free births are possible, even within a system that leads us to believe otherwise. Fear and Now shines a light on a birthing revolution already underway and calls on us to acknowledge and heal from the birth traumas we carry."
