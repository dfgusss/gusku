    "overview": "Ana and Lucio invent a religion and found a small cult in a closed, wealthy community. They perform rituals, pray, and work in a garden where they grow a psychoactive plant for their ceremonies. Mara, searching for her brother Damián, joins the community. Initially idyllic, the cult reveals a dark side. Mara connects with Lucio after consuming the plant's pollen, hallucinates, and discovers Ana's sinister plan. When she tries to escape, she discovers the end of the world."
