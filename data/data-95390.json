    "overview": "Commander Star Shark, Guppy, and the rest of the Star Shark Squad are locked in a tooth-to-fin battle with Lord Sword, Dr. Dorsal Fin, and their army of goblin sharks bent on devouring the universe! Or at least that's what you would see if legendary producer Richie Dante didn't blow the budget on his pooch Bobby Barko's endless supply of gourmet dog chow. Instead, strap yourself in for a movie that never quite made it to the stars but did manage some of the biggest names in the squared circle!"
