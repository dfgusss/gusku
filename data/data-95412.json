One day, he receives an invitation to a class reunion from an old friend. Yusaku is reluctant, but the words \"Minami's back in town\" stir a memory deep within his heart. Yusaku and Minami once shared a secret that they couldn't tell anyone about. When the day of the reunion arrives, the lives of Yusaku, Yukiko, and Minami begin to change dramatically.
