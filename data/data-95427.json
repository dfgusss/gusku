    "overview": "Jay Jurden has been called \"one of the most reliable killers working the New York comedy circuit\" (Jason Zinoman, NY Times), and his debut comedy special, \"Yes Ma'am\", proves just why that is the case. Jurden delivers a fast-paced, punchline-filled love letter on what it means to be Black, Southern, and Queer, all while navigating those identities with his signature wit. Filmed at the historic Joy Theater in downtown New Orleans, the Mississippi native and Tonight Show regular is ready to make a big splash with this premier hour presented by Comedy Dynamics."
