    "overview": "n 1664, Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was anointed as the Ninth Light of Guru Nanak. At that time, Emperor Aurangzeb’s rule cast a shadow across India — his mission was to turn the land into Dar-ul-Islam. When the oppressed Brahmins, led by Pandit Kripa Ram, came to the Guru seeking protection, he was deeply moved by their suffering. In an act of divine grace Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji chose to stand as their voice — not with armies or weapons, but with truth. He journeyed to Delhi, accompanied by his beloved disciples, Bhai Mati Das, Bhai Dayal Das, and Bhai Sati Das. What followed was not merely a confrontation but a defining moment in India’s moral history — the supreme sacrifice that echoes through eternity A timeless symbol to dharma, truth, the courage the defence of religious feedon and human rights."
