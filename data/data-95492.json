    "overview": "She inspired a masterpiece… then vanished into the streets of 19th century Paris. Little Dancer is a new musical based on the story of Marie van Goethem, the girl who posed for impressionist Edgar Degas and became the heart of one of the most celebrated sculptures in history. This evocative original show is a bold exploration of the indomitable spirit of a young woman in a man’s world."
