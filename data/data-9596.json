    "overview": "Dubai-based criminal don Uday takes it upon himself to try and get his half-sister Sanjana married - in vain, as no one wants to be associated with a crime family. Uday's associate and best friend Majnu finds a well to do, nice young man, Rajiv, who lives with his maternal uncle and aunt - Dr. and Mrs. Ghunghroo. Through extortion he compels the Ghunghroos to accept this matrimonial alliance. With no escape from this predicament, the wedding is planned, with hilarious consequences."
