    "overview": "Dry, wry and hilariously deadpan, Steven Wright unleashes a torrent of ironic and hysterical thought-provoking one-liners in the quirky stand-up style that has become his trademark. From Toronto's historic Elgin Theater, this Oscar-winning comedian keeps an adoring audience in stitches with random observations on everything from baby monitors as a form of wiretapping to his addiction to placebos."
