    "overview": "The greatly anticipated follow up to the platinum selling Beyond the Pale. In this Austin performance that capped off the 2008 sold-out stand up tour, Gaffigan does not let the audience catch their breath. This all-new show proves no other comedian working today can romanticize laziness and over-indulgence like Jim Gaffigan."
