    "overview": "An Irish funeral has a wake. A Jewish funeral has sitting shiva. A traditional Chinese funeral is something else entirely. That's what the estranged siblings of the Chinese-American Xiao family must undergo upon news of their mother's death. The one brother and three sisters don't get along, however, they share one thing: hatred for their domineering and manipulative mother, \"The Dragon Lady.\""
