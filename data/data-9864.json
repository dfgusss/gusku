    "overview": "The film consists of three independent parts: \"Workmate\", \"Déjà vu\" and \"Operation Y\". The plot follows the adventures of Shurik (alternative spelling — Shourick), the naive and nerdy Soviet student who often gets into ludicrous situations but always finds a way out very neatly.  \"Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures\" was a hit movie and became the leader of Soviet film distribution in 1965."
