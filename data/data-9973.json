    "overview": "They were looking for the ultimate getaway, they planned for the perfect paradise vacation; what they’re about to get is a trip no one is prepared for. When a group of five girlfriends heads for the tropics, they relax, hit the beach and step out for a night of partying. All is fun and games, until someone gets hurt. Robbed by their tour guide and left for dead, the girls take shelter in a deserted Mexican resort that is haunted by the unspeakable atrocities of past."
